I'll be right back with your drinks, ladies.\nAudrey: This place got an amazing write-up in timeout: Boston. I'm really glad I decided to tag along.\nJoey: You mean invite yourself.\nAudrey: Will you stop? (Jen's cell phone rings) Nobody believes that you don't adore me.\nJen: (answering her phone) Hello?\nJoey & Audrey: (singing) Char-lie!\nJen: (into phone) Ha! Hi.\nAudrey: (to Joey) So do we like this Charlie?\nJoey: We don't really know this Charlie. She seems to keep this Charlie pretty much to herself.\nAudrey: I'm a little concerned. This is all sounding very Nine 1/2 Weeks to me. (Jen hangs up) Booty call?\nJen: Pretty much. Yeah.\nAudrey: Oh! I knew it.\nJoey: Are you gonna go?\nJen: I don't know. I could use the snuggles.\nAudrey: See, that's what I miss most about not having a boyfriend-- the snuggling. It's better than s*x. If only guys knew how easy it was to make us happy.\nJoey: Yeah, but you know what? Even if they did know, they'd still screw it up. Snuggling to them is merely just a means to an end.\nJen: I mean, I've been seeing Charlie for a week, and the only thing that I really know about him is that his boxers are from The Gap.\nAudrey: Well, there are worse things, you know?\nJen: Such as?\nAudrey: Well, for instance, he could be a tighty-whitey guy.\nJen and Joey: Oh!\nJen: Oh, good point!\nJoey: Ok. On that note... I'm gonna go to the bathroom, and when I get back, I'd like it very much if this week's episode of s*x and the City had come to an end.\nJen: Ok, Charlotte.\n(Joey heads to the bathroom when she stops short. Her face turns serious as they show what she's looking at  A guy who looks like Pacey scene through a window in the door to the kitchen. As a waitress comes out of the kitchen, the door swings open and Pacey is in full view. Opening credits.)\n[Restaurant  Joey moves to a bench near the restroom, followed by Jen.]\nJoey: I wonder how long he's been in town.\nJen: 3 and 1/2 weeks.\nJoey: You think it's been that long?\nJen: Yeah, I'm positive.\nJoey: You knew?\nJen: Only that he was in Boston, not that he was working at this restaurant. I swear.\nJoey: Why didn't you tell me?\nJen: Because he made me promise not to.\nJoey: I should go.\nJen: No, Joey... don't you want to see him or talk to him?\nJoey: Of course I want to see him, but he obviously doesn't want to see me.\nJen: No-- you don't know that.\nJoey: 3 1/2 weeks. Jen, if he wanted to see me, he would have, and if he wanted to see me, he wouldn't have asked you not to tell me. (she gets up and walks out)\n[Grams' House  Dawson is in the living room when Grams returns with blankets and a pillow.]\nDawson: Grams, thank you again for letting me stay here.\nGrams: I quite enjoy having an expatriate sleeping on my sofa. Makes it feel like Paris in the twenties around here. Alas, no crepes, but I did bake you some Rice Krispie squares for your bus trip tomorrow.\nDawson: Oh, how can I be so sure about something and so nervous about doing it at the same time?\nGrams: Staying in Boston. It's a big decision.\nDawson: Well, I can handle it. It's just telling my parents I'm worried about.\nGrams: Well, they might surprise you.\nDawson: Maybe I should just give it more time.\nGrams: Because of your busy schedule?\nDawson: Because I-- I don't even know what I'm gonna tell them.\nGrams: The truth will set you free.\nDawson: The truth will tick them off. Maybe a letter.\nGrams: If Moses could face Pharaoh, you can face your parents.\n[Frat House  People are partying and drinking while Jack and Blossom sit on the couch playing PS2. They are yelling and laughing over the game they are playing, until Jack finally scores and they cheer.]\nBlossom: Oh, yes! Whoo! Yes! You are the man, Jack. You the man.\nJack: All right. Man can't breathe.\nBlossom: (introducing Jack to someone) Jack, this is Polar Bear.\nJack: Hey!\nPolar Bear: Welcome to Sigma house, Jack. Good to have you.\nJack: (shaking hands) Thanks, man.\nPolar Bear: How are your classes going?\nJack: Not bad. Not bad.\nPolar Bear: Thompson's Astro class is a bitch, huh?\nJack: (surprised) Yeah. It is, actually. That's the one class I'm really struggling with. How'd you know that?\nPolar Bear: (handing him a business card) Call me. We'll talk about the topic of your pop quiz next week.\nPete: (walking up) Blossom, this the guy?\nBlossom: Jack McPhee, Pete Willard.\nPete: How you doing, Jack? Welcome to the house.\nJack: Thanks.\nPete: So you get any time on the links lately?\nJack: Oh, man, I wish. It's kind of hard to scare up a golf game with the college crowd.\nBlossom: Pete's on a full-ride golfing scholarship at Boston Bay.\nJack: I don't think we're playing the same game.\nPete: Ah, you can shoot under par at Capeside Country Club, you can hang. So you interested in helping me humiliate a couple of ATO's Sunday morning?\nJack: Yeah, I'd love to.\nPete: All right, man. Good to meet you.\nJack: Cool. Thanks.\nPete: Later, buddy.\nBlossom: (handing him a plate with a baked potato and a glass of beer) Here you go, man.\nJack: You got to be kidding me. How do you know so much about me?\nBlossom: A bid to Sigma Ep is for life. Before we extend that privilege, we pretty much make sure we know everything about each guy rushing the house.\nJack: Actually, Blossom, look, I think I should probably\nBlossom: Excuse me. I think a pledge just accepted his bid. I got a new brother. (he walks off to join a bunch of frat guys carrying another guy around and singing the Sigma Ep song.)\n[Restaurant  Kitchen. Pacey is peeling potatoes when Karen walks in with a salad.]\nKaren: This loudmouthed blond girl just returned her Caesar salad because of the anchovies. [Imitating Audrey] She, like, hates anchovies.\nPacey: So?\nKaren: You wouldn't understand.\nPacey: You want to know something I really don't understand? Danny hires me on as the new cook, right? But then he won't let me cook. I don't know about you, but this, to me, looks a lot like potato peeling.\nKaren: You're not wearing the hat. Why aren't you wearing the hat? There are health regulations, you know.\nPacey: I would sooner slap on a pair of chaps, ok?\nKaren: Fine, Pacey. Don't wear the hat.\nPacey: All right. Is it just me, or are you not liking me so much tonight? What? Now you're not even talking to me?\nKaren: I'm working.\nPacey: No, you're waiting.\nKaren: I'm thinking.\nPacey: Well, you're usually talking.\nKaren: Did it ever occur to you that I might actually have other things to do besides stand around the kitchen and yak it up with the new prep cook?\nPacey: You see a prep cook? Because that actually refers to somebody who would cook, which I'm not doing. All I'm doing is peeling potatoes, so I know you couldn't be talking to me.\n[Charlie's Dorm  Jen shows up for her booty call.]\nJen: Just so you know, um, this is not gonna become a regular thing.\nCharlie: What's not?\nJen: You calling, me just showing up here in the middle of the night like this.\nCharlie: Yeah, but you didn't just show up. You know, I could have gotten a pizza in less time than it took you. Actually, two pizzas, deep-dish, Chicago-style. (he starts to kiss her)\nJen: Chicago? Is that where you're from?\nCharlie: (trying to kiss her) Not exactly.\nJen: Well, um... where exactly?\nCharlie: Do we really need to talk about this right now?\nJen: Yes... because we've been, you know, whatever for a week now, and I feel like I don't know the most basic things about you.\nCharlie: (kissing her) Come on. Sure you do.\nJen: Where'd you grow up?\nCharlie: (more kissing) All over.\nJen: Where d you go to high school, then?\nCharlie: Lots of places.\nJen: (breaking free from Charlie) Ok, see... that's what I mean. These-- these are not real answers.\nCharlie: Come on. So? The real answers are boring and long.\nJen: And what? You only provide them on a need-to-know basis?\nCharlie: Yes. Highland park, Illinois. Not exactly the birthplace of cool. All right?\nJen: There. Wasn't so hard, was it?\nCharlie: It was torture.\n[Capeside  The Leery Residence. Dawson stands in the backyard looking at the Creek. Suddenly Mitch comes outside.]\nMitch: Dawson?\nDawson: Hey, dad.\n[Leery Residence  Living room. Dawson is looking at the couch.]\nDawson: New couch.\nMitch: Your mom's been on a redecorating kick ever since you left.\nDawson: I like it.\nMitch: I miss my old one.\nGale: (coming downstairs) Dawson! Oh, I can't believe it! What a surprise! Oh! Is this really you?\nDawson: It's really me.\nGale: Oh, look at you! Oh, my God. You are thin as a rail.\nMitch: I want to hear about L.A. You get that deal with Dreamworks yet?\nGale: Did you get the cookies that I sent you?\nDawson: No, actually, I didn't. I haven't gotten the cookies because I haven't gotten my mail in L.A. For over a week.\nMitch: Class is really that intense, huh? Well, good. You'll learn something.\nDawson: I haven't gotten my mail because I haven't been in L.A.\nGale: Uh, I don't get it.\nDawson: I've been in Boston.\nGale: Uh... still not getting it.\nDawson: Um... guys, USC Is not for me. I want to drop out. I know this comes as a surprise to both of you, but I spent the whole summer in L.A., And I went to every single one of my classes, and the main thing that I learned about LA is that LA is just not where I want to be right now.\nGale: And Boston is?\nDawson: All my friends are in Boston.\nGale: Oh, honey. You'll make new friends in California. It just takes some time.\nDawson: Mom, it's more than that. It's more than that. I'm... I'm at a profound crossroads in my life, and I know that if I don't choose this path, I'm going to have significant regrets.\nGale: Hmm Where would you live?\nDawson: Uh, with Jack and Jen at Grams'.\nGale: What would you do?\nDawson: Find a new school.\nGale: Oh, Dawson.\nDawson: Mom, I know I sound like a complete flake, but I promise you, I've given this a lot of thought.\nMitch: I've given this some thought myself, and I've decided... you're not dropping out.\nDawson: It doesn't work like that, dad.\nMitch: If you're going to stand here and talk to me about crossroads and paths so you can drop out of school and go crash on a sofa, then don't presume to talk to me like you're an adult. (he walks out of the room)\nGale: (Lily starts to cry through the monitor) Oh! Lily, I know how you feel. (she goes upstairs leaving Dawson alone.)\nDawson: Welcome home.\n[Joey's Dorm  Joey is cleaning out something as Audrey tries to get her to open up.]\nAudrey: Ok. So who's the guy?\nJoey: What guy?\nAudrey: The guy who you saw at the restaurant last night that obviously has some huge impact on your life.\nJoey: Audrey, the only guy that has an impact on my life right now is James Joyce, and I can't focus on him until I get this room in order.\nAudrey: You know... back in L.A., I was something of a therapist to a lot of my friends. People would call me all the time to talk about their problems. Some even paid the surcharge to call from the valley, and lucky you, you've got me here whenever you want me.\nJoey: Lucky me.\nAudrey: So why don't you stop cleaning up the mess and tell me about him?\nJoey: Don't you have a lacrosse team to date or something?\nAudrey: I have this theory about you. You want to hear it?\nJoey: No.\nAudrey: You love academia because of the rules, and you hate relationships because of the lack of them. So do you want to see him or not?\nJoey: Yes. No. Yes, but only if he wants to see me, and he obviously doesn't.\nAudrey: Ha! God, you're dense. Of course he wants to see you.\nJoey: What makes you say that?\nAudrey: Because... you're beautiful and you don't know it. Because you're smart and you don't believe it. You're the kind of girl that guys never get over. Joey, you're the kind of girl that other girls get compared to.\nJoey: I don't-- I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable.\nAudrey: Why do I think you don't want to make yourself feel uncomfortable?\nJoey: It's complicated. I mean, it ended messy, and I don't want to make things worse.\nAudrey: Joey, no one's gonna grade you on how you handle this, you know? No one's gonna come along and tell you what's expected so you know how to succeed. Relationships are messy. That's their nature. They start messy, and they end messy, and if you ever want to have another relationship in your life, you better just stop worrying about the mess.\n[Frat House  the following day. Jack sleeping on the couch when he is woken up by Blossom.]\nBlossom: (handing him an envelope) Do you know what this is, McPhee?\nJack: I'm not even sure where I am.\nBlossom: The inner chapter room. Sigmas don't let you drink and drive. We plan on keeping our house. See these pictures on the wall? Every one of these Sigma men looked at the very same thing you're looking at right now. This is your future, Jack. Open it.\nJack: (opening his invitation) Wow! What happens if I accept?\nBlossom: You live in the house, you eat your meals here, your problems become our problems, your success, our success. We're your brothers, your family. What do you think, Jack?\nJack: I--I don't know what to think. It's all kind of overwhelming.\nBlossom: There comes a point in every man's life when he has to ask himself that one fundamental question-- am I in or am I out?\nJack: Yeah... yeah, I've asked myself that question, actually, and I think you guys really need to know the answer. (they all look at him) I'm gay.\nBlossom: (the guys laugh a little) You thought we didn't know that?\nJack: Most people are surprised.\nBlossom: Most people aren't Sigma people. You're sigma people, Jack. You're one of us.\nJack: You mean, there's other guys in the house that are gay?\nBlossom: You'd be the first.\nJack: Most fraternities are not particularly well known for, you know, their tolerance towards alternative lifestyles.\nBlossom: Which is precisely why we need you in this house, McPhee. Listen, Sigma Ep has a reputation for being one of the roughest, party-hearty, alpha male fraternities on campus, a reputation which is not entirely unfounded. The dean wants us to diversify. The dean gets what the dean wants, so, yes, Jack, we know you're gay, and we want you in this house because you're gay.\n[Charlie's Dorm  Jen and Charlie are in bed together.]\nJen: So...what's your favorite color?\nCharlie: I don't know. The color of your eyes.\nJen: (covering Charlie's eyes) And that would be?\nCharlie: This is ridiculous. You think I've been sleeping with you for a week and I don't know what color your eyes are?\nJen: Humor me.\nCharlie: Brown.\nJen: With subtle flecks of green.\nCharlie: Look, it's not entirely my fault that we just happen to have a completely normal, healthy, active s*x life.\nJen: What are you saying? That it's my fault?\nCharlie: No. I'm just saying that neither one of us has very much in the way of self-control.\nJen: Huh! You don't think that we could go a day without having s*x of any kind?\nCharlie: A day? Are you insane, woman? We'd be lucky to make it 12 hours.\nJen: What's the matter? Afraid you couldn't hold out?\nCharlie: Now, you see... I know I can hold out. I'm just not sure you can.\nJen: Well, all right, then. Bring it on. 12 hours, starting right now, no s*x. (Charlie moves to kiss her. Jen sounds unresisting.) No. No. What--oh! Huh.\nCharlie: Maybe we should get out of bed.\nJen: Good idea.\n[Restaurant  Pacey is still working on potatoes the next day. Karen walks in.]\nPacey: So is it me? Did I forget to replace the paper towels in the employee washroom? (she ignores him) You know, Brecher told me that the waitresses were moody, but you, Madame, are off the charts, and that guy is a total, complete, and utter wackjob, because he caught me touching one of the pans today, and the guy almost snapped. \"Put down the ironclad and step away from the stove.\"\nKaren: Allclad.\nPacey: Huh?\nKaren: Why would he let you mess with something you don't even know the name of?\nPacey: Oh, come on. Just hate him with me for a second, would you? You know, nothing'll bond two colleagues quicker than bitching about the boss.\nKaren: We're not colleagues. This isn't a law firm. I wait for people. You cook for them.\nPacey: Uh, no. I don't actually cook for them. I just get to cut their potatoes into paper-thin slices for reasons that are, quite frankly, beyond me.\nKaren: The whole job is beyond you.\nPacey: Ok. What's the problem?\nKaren: He's got you doing classic culinary prep work. You have to wear the hat so that some nice young woman who's here on her first date doesn't puke in the ladies' room when she finds a strand of your greasy hair in her pumpkin puree, and the only problem I have is that I'm working with someone whose sole qualification for this job is his gender.\nPacey: Well, you see, this is good. We're making progress now because you just exploded on me. I just have no idea why.\n[Capeside  Dawson's Room. Dawson sits on the floor next to his bed when Mitch walks in.]\nMitch: When I was your age, I used to spend hours and hours just sitting around thinking about my life.\nDawson: Why'd you stop?\nMitch: Well, I guess I got too busy living it to sit around reflecting on it.\nDawson: I hope I never get to that place.\nMitch: Dawson... I am sleeping in the room with a baby monitor. I'm tired, so don't B.S. me. You and I both know what this is about. This is about a girl.\nDawson: You say that like it's a bad thing.\nMitch: You've been making movies ever since you were a little boy. I first heard about USC when you were 10, and for the last 4 years, it's been the frigging mantra of the leery household. So what do you do? You work your tail off. You overcome hell and high water and the kind of adversity that would send ordinary kids running for cover, and you actually do the impossible, and you get yourself in. You did it, Dawson. You...did it. Now here you are... your whole life ahead of you, and you're thinking about chucking it all away? What are you-- you crazy?\nDawson: Maybe a little.\nMitch: You want to talk about standing at a crossroads, fine, but for God's sake, choose your own path.\nDawson: Dad, that's what I'm trying to do.\nMitch: No, you're not. You're following Joey down hers. I know how much she means to you, but do you really think it's wise to make major life decisions based on someone else? Remember, this isn't high school anymore. The stakes are high. Your decisions have real consequences.\nDawson: God, come on. Dad, honestly, do you think I don't know that? You think I don't know that this is the most important decision of my life?\nMitch: Then make the right one.\nDawson: Dad, it's not that simple.\nMitch: It really is. Dawson... I have lived twice as long as you, and I'm just trying to give you the benefit of my experiences.\nDawson: Dad, I can't live the life that you want me to have. I can't live the life that you choose for me, all right? I have to have my own.\nMitch: Your own?\nDawson: Yes.\nMitch: Fine. Here's the opportunity to have the life you've wanted ever since you were a little boy. (hands him an airline ticket) I booked you on the 3:30 tomorrow. Seize this opportunity, Dawson. Seize it. It'll be gone in a moment... and that's life.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Leery Residence  Dawson sits on a blanket outside with Lilly. Gale and Mitch sit in the distance watching them.]\nGale: I've got a little confession to make. It's completely and utterly selfish, but I totally want him to drop out of USC and come back and be close to us.\nMitch: When I saw him out there standing in the yard, my heart pretty much leapt out of my chest, and I thought, \"God, I miss this kid.\" I miss having him around and seeing him across the table at dinner. I miss hearing what he thinks about whatever movie he's just seen. Do you know how much I love my life? I have this amazing family. I mean, I know everybody says that, but, trust me, I've been around the block long enough to know that what we have here is so incredibly rare. But you see... it's the only thing I've ever really been good at.\nGale: Oh, honey.\nMitch: No, no, no. I'm a family man. I can say with relative certainty that I will never write a poem... (Gale laughs) Or paint a painting or make a movie that will change the world. Just wasn't in the cards for me, and that's ok because maybe, just maybe... our son will do that. (Gale kisses him) What was that for?\nGale: What can I say? I love my boys.\n[Charlie's Dorm  Jen and Charlie are trying to not have s*x.]\nJen: (looking through a newspaper) This is working. This is totally working. Two people, two cups of coffee, just doing what people do who don't have s*x.\nCharlie: Going to a movie?\nJen: Mm-hmm. Um, check this out. Fellini retrospective-- la strada, la dolce vita...\nCharlie: Uh, no, I can't do it. No subtitles.\nJen: No subtitles?\nCharlie: No. I can't stand them. You know, if I want to read, I'll pick up a book.\nJen: What happened to \"I'll see anything\"?\nCharlie: Well, anything without subtitles.\nJen: Not even action movies? No John Woo, Jackie Chan, Crouching Tiger?\nCharlie: Is this some kind of problem for you?\nJen: No. No. No. No. I mean... it's not like a difference of opinion on subtitles spells doom for a relationship, right? I mean, so what really? So what that I have an overwhelming physical attraction to somebody who categorically rejects the very best that world cinema has to offer just because he's a little too lazy to read the words on the screen.\nCharlie: Now, see? You're mad. No, no. This is good. This is good. This is what I was talking about-- us getting to know each other naturally. You learn a little something about me, I learn a little something about you, right? And before you know it, these 12 hours are up, and we can have s*x again.\n[Grams' House  Jack is talking with Grams.]\nJack: I got a bid to join Sigma.\nGrams: That's wonderful.\nJack: Tobey doesn't think so. He called me \"the gay uncle Tom.\" He's convinced that they only want me to fill some kind of quota, which isn't entirely untrue.\nGrams: How do you feel when you're over there?\nJack: Well, see, that's the weird thing. I mean, for the first time in my life, I feel like I've finally found a place where I'm comfortable, you know? I fit in with these guys.\nGrams: What's weird about that?\nJack: I'd be the only gay guy in the house.\nGrams: Oh. Well, it sounds to me like... its more of an issue with you than it is with them.\nJack: You're right. You're right, but that's strange because it's typically not how I am.\nGrams: But it is typically how Tobey is. If these fellows know you 1/10 as well as I know you, I am quite certain they want you for much more than filling a quota.\n[Capeside  Gale and Dawson sit on a picnic table.]\nGale: Did Joey ask you to stay in Boston?\nDawson: No.\nGale: Are you two\nDawson: Together? No. It makes no logical sense. I know. The past few years of my life, I haven't done anything without a clear-cut objective. I've always been asking myself, \"What's my goal? What am I trying to accomplish?\" And my whole life, everybody's always been telling me to follow my heart. The irony is, now that I've finally figured out what that means, everybody's telling me I'm crazy if I do it.\nGale: No, honey. I'm not saying not to follow your heart, but... people change, Dawson. It's a fact. You, all of your friends, you're all gonna change. So if you are absolutely sure that you want to be with Joey, just make sure that you are not going to prevent either one of you from growing. And, sweetheart, I am not dismissing this beautiful idea of soul mates, but the reality of eternal coupling... well, quite frankly, it boils down to one thing... faith. So ask yourself this question-- is Joey the kind of person that you are willing to take a very big leap of faith for?\n[Dorm  Charlie and Jen are comparing themselves to each other while they play Gin.]\nCharlie: Coke.\nJen: Pepsi. Exile in guyville.\nCharlie: Exile on Main Street.\nJen: Favorite president?\nCharlie: I don't know. Lincoln? Hmm. I am from Illinois.\nJen: Favorite Charlie's Angel?\nCharlie: Cameron Diaz. Now can we just get back to playing Gin?\nJen: No. Not until we find something that we have in common.\nCharlie: Look. We already have something in common--sex.\nJen: Well, you've got to find something else. You can't base a relationship purely on s*x.\nCharlie: Now, you see, I beg to differ. s*x is a pretty big thing to have in common. I mean, what exactly are we trying to prove here? What possible reason could there be for two intelligent, responsible people who just happen to have an overwhelming physical attraction for each other to deny that attraction? (he moves to Jen)\nJen: Oh, why are you leaving your side of the room?\nCharlie: Because. (he climbs in bed with her)\nJen: Are you kidding?\nCharlie: No. Are you?\nJen: (they start to kiss) No. Ok. Ok, but this does not mean that we're gonna give up on finding something that we have in common.\nCharlie: Agreed.\nJen: Because, I mean, at some point, this relationship has to move out of the room.\nCharlie: Agreed.\nJen: I'm sure that this is just a stage, and as long as both people are intelligent and responsible, there's no reason why we can't have(Charlie looks upset) what?\nCharlie: No condoms. We used the last one last night.\nJen: You're kidding me. Well, go find one.\nCharlie: What?\nJen: Go borrow one. Go get one.\nCharlie: Why borrow when we can steal? Come on. Let's go. Come on. (he grabs her hand and pulls her off the bed)\nJen: What-- where-- where are we going?\nCharlie: Look. We're taking this relationship out of the bedroom, all right?\n[Boston Docks  Joey walks down the docks looking for Pacey's boat. She finally spots him and walks up slowly.]\nJoey: (looking up at the sky) You can't see them very well, can you, at night in the city?\nPacey: (surprised, he turns around to look at her. He smiles a little and looks up at the sky.) What, the stars? Um... no, you can't see them very well, (looking at Joey) but what the hell? I've seen them all before, right?\nJoey: (finally looking at him and smiling) Me, too. (he motions for her to come aboard and helps her up)\nPacey: So I'm guessing that this means that Lindley sold me out, huh?\nJoey: Ah, go easy on her. I saw you at the restaurant.\nPacey: Ah, yeah. My new stomping grounds.\nJoey: Well, after that, she did unravel like a cheap suit.\nPacey: Which would explain why she hasn't been around to see me lately.\nJoey: No, that would be because she met a guy.\nPacey: Really? That's good for her.\nJoey: Yeah. So I guess, um, she's told you about these Sunday dinners we've been having.\nPacey: Uh, yeah. I seem to remember something to that effect.\nJoey: Well, it's-- it's nice. I mean, we try to get together every week because it's easy to get lost in the big city.\nPacey: Well, of course it is. You don't have enough stars to guide you.\nJoey: You should try to come some time.\nPacey: I'll try and do that.\nJoey: Because, Pace, I would-- I would hate that... you not coming had anything to do with me.\nPacey: With you?\nJoey: Or this thing we shared called the romance. You know, I did really badly, and there was bitterness and tears and... recrimination.\nPacey: Yeah. I think I remember that. We dated once, right?\nJoey: Yeah, we did, didn't we? (she moves to the wheel and he helps her over) But, you know, I've practically forgotten now that I've slept with half the football team.\nPacey: Really? Just half? I think that shows incredible restraint on your part.\nJoey: Well, I had to leave half for my roommate.\nPacey: Oh, roommate. Oh, lord. I feel sorry for this person. 24 hours a day, confined in a small space with you-- it's not healthy. (they both take a seat)\nJoey: I don't snore.\nPacey: I beg to differ.\nJoey: So, Pace, um... the other day, I had to read this article for biology, and it said that contrary to all previous thinking on the subject, human beings may actually be able to regrow brain cells.\nPacey: So I guess that means the whole \"this is your brain on drugs\" thing is moot.\nJoey: I wouldn't go toking up just yet... but I think what it means is that at some point in the not-so-distant future, it may actually be possible to forget all the bad stuff and only remember the good.\nPacey: I don't know. If you ask me, I think that's already possible. So tell me some more about this new roommate of yours.\nJoey: You really want to know?\nPacey: Well, of course I want to know.\nJoey: No. I want to know about your job and this boat. This is one mother of a boat, Pace.\nPacey: Yeah, I know. I mean, it's not technically mine, but it's good for right now. And the job is a job, but this summer...\n[Leery Residence  Dawson finishes packing up his bag and goes downstairs. Gale has Lily with her.]\nGale: (to Lily) Ok, sweetheart. Come on. Oh, yes. (to Dawson) Oh, honey, did you remember your sweaters?\nDawson: Yes, mom. I remembered everything you packed for me.\nGale: Ok. Um, look. (Handing him a ziplock bag of cookies) I made these for you for your trip. Please promise me that you'll eat more.\nDawson: I promise.\nGale: (kissing him) I love you.\nDawson: I love you, too. Good-bye, Lily. Good-bye. Ok, sweetie. Be good. Try not to spit up on mom too much, ok? (Lily grabs his bag of cookies) Those are my cookies. They're mine.\nGale: (to Lily) Ohh, he'll come back. (Mitch walks in)\nDawson: (handing him the airline ticket) Hope you can get a refund on that. Dad, I know you think I'm making a mistake, but if I am, it's a mistake I have to make for myself, all right? And I know when you think about this, you're gonna realize I'm only trying to be the kind of person you taught me to be.\nMitch: I think you are making a mistake, Dawson, a huge mistake, and I am disappointed in you. But never, ever for a single second forget that I love you... and I will always be here for you. (Mitch walks out)\nDawson: Mom?\nGale: He'll be fine. Call him.\nDawson: I will. (he goes out to his cab and gets in. Mitch watches as it pulls away.)\n[Boston Bay Health Center  Jen and Charlie are climbing through a window.]\nJen: So... breaking and entering a typical second date for you?\nCharlie: We're not breaking and entering. Hey, the window was open, right?\nJen: Isn't that just a little bit convenient?\nCharlie: No, because there's nothing in here worth stealing... except... a Boston Bay tradition.\nJen: What, breaking into this health center and stealing condoms is a Boston Bay tradition?\nCharlie: (there's a huge glass container filled with condoms on the counter, with a sign over it) It's not stealing. They're free. See? Read the sign. \"Gift to the class of 1990. Here's hoping you get laid.\"\nJen: Is that what you think that that sign says?\nCharlie: Well, something like that. I'm paraphrasing. Look. I haven't actually been here in a while. So if we could just get what we came for\nJen: You can't read the sign, can you?\nCharlie: Oh, come on. Who could read that from here? That's like china from here.\nJen: (reading the sign) \"Gift to the class of 1990, in anticipation of a world without aids.\"\nCharlie: I was close.\nJen: You are totally nearsighted, aren't you?\nCharlie: I'm not nearsighted. I just-- I just can't read really teeny things far away.\nJen: Like--I don't know-- um, subtitles?\nCharlie: Yes. Subtitles, all right? I hate subtitles because I can't read them without my glasses. You satisfied?\nJen: Yes. Actually, I think that this little field trip was a good idea because now I finally know something about you.\nCharlie: What, that I'm nearsighted? Trust me. They make me look like a total dork.\nJen: You are a total dork, a vain dork. Come here and kiss me. (they sink to the floor. Charlie snakes his hand into the glass and grabs a condom.)\n[Frat House  Jack is speaking with Blossom and the other brothers.]\nJack: I don't want to be wanted just to-- to fill some kind of quota.\nBlossom: Well, you know the reason we first came after you, Jack, but the truth is, man, we really like you. Don't be thrown by this quota thing. Yeah, you're filling one. I'm filling one. He's filling one. Everybody in this room has qualities and experiences that are unique. That's why Sigmas kick butt.\nJack: Yeah, but you want a gay guy in the house\nBlossom: Yes, we do, but you're the one we want.\nJack: All right, but do you understand the reality of what you're gonna get here? I mean, my boyfriend, Tobey, when he comes to visit, I mean, he's gonna be eating here and partying here, too, and if I live in the house, you know, he's gonna be sleeping here and showering here.\nBlossom: Jack... Tobey is welcome. Even if you don't live at the house, if he needs a place to crash, this is his home, too. That's what it means to be a brother.\nJack: Cool.\nBlossom: So what do you say, Jack?\nJack: I say sign me up!\nBlossom: Welcome to the house, brother.\nJack: Thanks, man.\nBrother: All right! Yeah! (they all cheer and life Jack up on their shoulders.)\n[Restaurant  Brecher walks into the kitchen and up to Pacey.]\nPacey: Hey. I'm done. 42 pounds of peeled and sliced potatoes. Now, may I please cook them?\nBrecher: Quiet.\nPacey: Ok.\nBrecher: (examining the sliced potatoes) Well, now. Looks like you started getting the hang of it toward the end here. There's hope for you.\nPacey: Ah, thanks. (Brecher takes the huge bowl of potatoes and dumps the entire thing in the trash.) What are you do-- that was hours of work, man!\nBrecher: I don't serve potato chips in my restaurant.\nPacey: Really? So then why did you waste my time and your money having me do that?\nBrecher: Training.\nPacey: Ah. Ok. (Brecher grabs Pacey's hand with the knife in it and grabs him forcefully over to a cutting board.)\nBrecher: (handing him a potato like object  a truffle) Here, wack job. Slice.\nPacey: What is that?\nBrecher: Forget about what it is. Slice it, just like the potato. (Pacey professionally slices it thin) That's not bad. You're learning.\nPacey: Now would you mind telling me what this is all about?\nBrecher: Behold the white truffle-- so fresh that you can actually see the little hoof marks from the pig that dug it out of the I-talian soil. These babies go for $1,200 a pound.\nPacey: What? That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.\nBrecher: Now, if I let some headstrong kid get anywhere near them without proper training, I really would be a wack job. Taste. (he pulls a slice of truffle out of a pot and gives it to Pacey)\nPacey: (eating) Ok. I get it.\nBrecher: Karen has more discipline and motivation than a slack-ass like you will ever have, but this isn't kick boxing, and that's why I wouldn't give her your job.\nPacey: (laughing) She wanted my job.\nBrecher: Yeah. You're not gonna pick this up through sheer will. Cooking is a craft which can't be taught. However, it can be learned.\nPacey: What does that mean?\nBrecher: Clean up your station. You're cooking the truffle ravioli tomorrow.\n[Worthington  Joey enters her dorm building and checks her mail. As she moves to the steps, she sees Dawson sitting there.]\nDawson: How was your weekend?\nJoey: Strange and unusual. How about yours?\nDawson: Strange and unpleasant.\nJoey: You ok?\nDawson: Not really. I alienated my parents, and now I find myself adrift in a sea of uncertainty. But, hey, what else is new, right?\nJoey: Can I do something to help?\nDawson: Yeah. You can tell me that I, without a doubt, made the right decision and that this decision will have nothing but positive repercussions for the rest of my life.\nJoey: Dawson, I can't do that.\nDawson: Damn.\nJoey: But I can tell you this. There is no right or wrong, just consequences of your actions.\nDawson: What the hell does that mean?\nJoey: Well, I'm not sure exactly. My sociology professor said that last week, and I thought it sounded pretty profound at the time.\nDawson: Great. I should just get on a plane right now.\nJoey: We can't. We tried that already. We can't seem to get you on that plane. You're like Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. How about a cup of coffee?\nDawson: Sure. It's about time I got acquainted with this city of yours.\nJoey: So how was Capeside?\nDawson: Same old same old. They're tearing down the new rialto, building, like, a new 16-theater multiplex or something.\nJoey: I guess it just goes to show you.\nDawson: What?\nJoey: You can never go home again.\n[Capeside  The Mitch Mobile. Mitch is driving at night, back from the grocery store. He is singing Drift Away and eating an ice cream cone. Suddenly his top scoop falls off. He tries to reach it, but can't. He lowers his body to reach it and when he sits up, lights from an oncoming car brighten his face. A horn blares and it blacks out.

        "prompt_0": "Int. Sydney's apartment. She looks at herself in the mirror with a weird/curious look, then walks over to the sink and sits down. Then, pushing the tap up to let the water run, she puts a kettle under the tap and fills it up. She walks over to the stove and let the water boil, while picking up a box and reading its contents of a sachet. A man runs across the translucent doors and he pushes them open. It's Vaughn, grocery bag in his hands.\nVAUGHN: Back! Sydney looks up, a smile growing on her face.\nSYDNEY: Hey. What took you so long?\nVAUGHN: Traffic light out on Venice. She still has a weird look on her face as he comes over and kisses her.\nSYDNEY: Would you look at something for me?\nVAUGHN: Yeah.\nSYDNEY: See an eyelash? (Widens her left eye with her hand) Something itches like hell.\nVAUGHN: (he looks) No.\nSYDNEY: Sure?\nVAUGHN: Yeah, maybe those contacts you wore on the Ireland mission irritated your eye. She doesn't look too convinced.\nSYDNEY: Yeah. Vaughn starts taking the groceries out of the bag and Sydney peers into the bag.\nSYDNEY: What's this?\nVAUGHN: What do you think about Orecchietti?\nSYDNEY: I don't think I've ever heard of it. Vaughn takes a cutting knife out. The sound made is loud and crisp, and Sydney has a weird look on her face again.\nSYDNEY: Wait a minute, don't tell me you cook.\nVAUGHN: (A smile on his face) There are a lot of things about me you don't know.\nSYDNEY: You clean, too? (She's still looking through the grocery bag)\nVAUGHN: I've been known to. Why, you thinking about hiring me?\nSYDNEY: Why would I hire you when I get you for free?\nVAUGHN: (small laugh) Are you taking a bath?\nSYDNEY: (She walks behind him) Maybe. (There's a somewhat cheeky look on her face) Maybe we're gonna take a bath. Close up shot of Vaughn cutting the broccoli. He accidentally cuts his finger.\nVAUGHN: Ah, damn it. Sydney rushes over immediately, a look of concern etched on her face.\nSYDNEY: You okay?\nVAUGHN: Yeah, I'm fine. (Sydney takes his hand to inspect the wound)\nSYDNEY: Let me see. (She applies pressure to it)\nVAUGHN: It's nothing.\nSYDNEY: Not nothing. (They look at each other and Vaughn looks pleased at her concern.) Scene changes. The background music now sounds like it's coming from the radio. We get another closeup of their hands, and this time Sydney is putting a bandaid over the wound. Vaughn looks at her and smiles a little, and she puts his finger to her mouth and kisses it.\nSYDNEY: Here you go. All better.\nVAUGHN: You're gonna make a great mom.\nSYDNEY: Yeah, maybe. The statement seemed to have hit a raw nerve. She stands up, presumably to place the bandaid box to its place and in front of the mirror again.\nSYDNEY: Just that, my mom wasn't exactly the best role model.\nVAUGHN: Well the good news is that, you're nothing like your mother. Suddenly a warped voice in a voice over.\nVOICEOVER: You're not there yet, Sydney. She looks up in mild shock, then meets the eyes of Vaughn.\nSYDNEY: Did you hear that?\nVAUGHN: What. (It was almost as if it was a statement and not an answer...)\nSYDNEY: Radio.\nVOICEOVER: You need to go further back. Follow Vaughn\nVAUGHN: It's just the radio, Syd. If you don't like it we can turn it off. She seems to like that idea a lot.\nSYDNEY: That's right. Vaughn switches off the radio, then smiles.\nVAUGHN: How about a nice bottle of wine with this bath?\nSYDNEY: That would be great. Vaughn walks away, and Sydney looks in the mirror again. This time, she is shocked by what she sees. Something odd is reflected; a blue hue. Sydney sees herself being held on a chair with electrodes stuck to her forehead and she squints. The scene changes into the actual scene of her being tortured for information. The camera view is now a mesh of colours which focuses slightly, and as it pans it occurs that we're looking through Sydney's eyes: She sees a doctor.\nSYDNEY: Who are you?\nDOCTOR: Shh. Syd, sit still. We're almost there, Sydney. He takes a syringe.\nDOCTOR: We almost have what we need. We just need to go a little further. Sydney squints and looks utterly confused. She sees him sucking liquid into the syringe and asks.\nSYDNEY: What are you doing to me?\nDOCTOR: Nothing for you to worry about. I'm just trying to help you relax.\nSYDNEY: Why? What do you want? (The doctor shushes her)\nDOCTOR: I just need to find a vein... A distorted voice fills the room.\nDISTORTED VOICE: Stop. Are you certain this won't harm the baby?\nDOCTOR: Quite certain.\nSYDNEY: (almost as if getting out of a stupor) Wait, the baby... don't...\nDOCTOR: (towards the one-side mirror) But if you want your answer you're going to need to let me do my job.\nSYDNEY: Who is that behind there? Who's behind there?\nDISTORTED VOICE: Okay, you may proceed.\nSYDNEY: If you hurt my baby... (he sticks the syringe in) I swear to you... (tears stream down her cheeks) I will kill you. We see the view from Sydney's eyes again, and the doctor gets blurred. End of scene.\nSAN FR[A]NCISCO\n2 DAYS EARLIER\nExt. Rain is pouring down and camera pans to a woman serving noodles.\nWOMAN: You like? We see Peyton at the receiving end.\nPEYTON: Yes, I like very much!\nWOMAN: It's nice to see girl like you eating noodle. My granddaughter, she tell me, 'too many carbs!' Peyton smiles politely and barely eats two mouthfuls of noodles before the door rings open. A man in a suit walks through the door and she jumps on her feet.\nPEYTON: Thank you! I'm late for a date!\nWOMAN: Okay! Bye bye! She rushes off and catches up with the man in the suit through the rain.\nPEYTON: Excuse me, Mister! Thank god, I'm supposed to meet some friends in the [Mission?] district. My cab driver from Oackland just dropped me off here and zoomed off. I - I've been trying to find a cab, and no one here seems to...\nMAN: There's a stand two blocks over the right.\nPEYTON: Thank you! He turns to walk away and she calls him again.\nPEYTON: Oh, do you know what time it is? He comes back and looks at his watch.\nMAN: Yeah, it's - (she stabs him and blood spews out from his mouth)\nPEYTON: Nice watch. (She pulls the knife out and places him against the wall, rummaging through his pockets and takes his watch off, looking furtively around (Because, like, there isn't anybody on that street, you know.) and walks away) She walks quickly through the same door and walks up the stairs, fiddling with the watch which is now on her wrist. Stopping at a door, she pushes three knobs up and gets green light, then placing the wristwatch on a sensor.\nACCESSING...\nAGENT ZACHARY TURNER\nACCESS GRANTED\nThe door opens and she enters the room, stopping at the nearest desk. There is another agent at his own desk.\nAGENT: Again Turner? You'll miss your plane. Peyton types.\nAGENT MICHAEL VAUGHN\nAGENT: You missed that pickup in Cartagena, I'm gonna hear it from the Director.\nShe presses enter while looking at the other agent, worried. Lots of technical effects before the screen stops at SERVER 4 SLOT 29. The agent turns around just as she walks towards server 4 presumably.\nAGENT: What did you forget this time? He gets up and looks, while the camera pans to Peyton looking for the server - still - and finally reaching it. The agent looks at the computer (still beeping away) and Peyton takes a handdrill to loosen the screws of slot 29. He walks the way of server 4; and Peyton continues to loosen the remaining screws. The agent finally reaches the spot - Peyton isn't there anymore. He starts to walk away, then looks at slot 29: it's open, so he walks towards it... Peyton jumps from behind and strangles him with a cord, asphyxiating him. She kicks him in the calf and he goes down on his knees, and she tightens the cord. He struggles... then dies. Peyton retrieves the data, puts it in her handbag and leaves, taking a last look at the dead agent.\nCut to outside. The first agent she killed is still propped up against the wall... Then slumps to the wet ground. Nice noodle woman comes around.\nWOMAN: Mister! You okay?! Peyton walks through that same door again, one ear against her cellphone.\nPEYTON: This is agent 4962 Bravo. Requesting for technician. Cuts to DeSantis in his office.\nDESANTIS: This is he.\nPEYTON: Dr. DeSantis, this is Kelly Peyton.\nDESANTIS (VO): Were you able to retrieve Agent Vaughn's files?\nPeyton: Yes. I'm exiting Chao Ke Street now. Camera pans to nice noodle woman who exclaims in anguish as she pokes at the dead agent.\n(the background sounds of the woman screaming)\nPEYTON: I'll run the analysis in the attaché (?)\nDESANTIS: Excellent. I'll let our benefactors know. (Referring to the background sound) What is that noise?\nPEYTON: You know how it is. Rough neighbourhood.\nShe clips the phone off. Off the camera, we see her walking away and the dead agent is still lying on the ground; the background sounds still filled with screams and shouts...\nCut to the Alias Theme\n(Or now is the time in Alias when we (used to, until the episode!) dance!)\nCamera pans over a nice shot of the skyscrapers of LA.\n(camera cuts to the interior of a hospital. The doctor leads the way and Jack is in front of Sydney)\n(Voiceover) DOCTOR LYNN: After your initial triage and check-in, we'll bring you up here into the labouring and delivery room.\nSYDNEY: So this is where I'll be getting my epidural.\nDOCTOR LYNN: Yes, it is. (she laughs lightly) If you want one.\nSYDNEY: I do. I'm - I'm not a big fan of pain.\nJACK: Are there any adjustments Sydney should be making to her life style? I'm sure her boss at the bank would be (he pauses slightly) happy to lighten her workload.\nDOCTOR LYNN: No, she's fine. I tell mothers staying active for as long as they can is a good thing.\nThey stop in the middle of the ward.\nDOCTOR LYNN: You must be excited. Won't be much longer now.\nSYDNEY: Oh no, the due date's still three weeks away.\nDOCTOR LYNN: Sure it is, but you never know. Your baby might be in a hurry. You're far enough along (camera cuts to Sydney's slightly shocked expression) if your water broke today we could expect a healthy delivery. (Sydney nods)\nSYDNEY: Wow, I, uh I didn't know that. (Doctor's pager beeps)\nDOCTOR LYNN: My service. I need to run. (she smiles at Sydney) I'll see you next week for your check-up. Sydney seems overwhelmed, but nods anyway.\nSYDNEY: Okay. They start walking out of the ward. Cut to Jack's slightly humoured expression:\nJACK: So, any day.\nSYDNEY: Well she said it could be any day. (she shrugs it off, but her expression on her face remains slightly surprised) They stop at the nursery, and the camera pans on a baby. His father is looking at him lovingly, and the camera pans back on Sydney's forlorn expression. Jack looks at Sydney awkwardly, then reaches into his pocket.\nJACK: I have something for you.\nSYDNEY: What? He hands her a little wrapped gift and she looks surprised.\nSYDNEY: A gift?\nJACK: Technically, no (she starts pulling at the ribbon), it's already yours. I'm just... returning it. She opens it, all the while sharing a smile on his face. It's a little rattler.\nJACK: Your mother and I bought it when you were born. You wouldn't let it out of your sight 'til you're almost three. Reminds me of the time when I could keep you safe. (Sydney is full of gratitude, then of sadness)\nSYDNEY: It's beautiful, Dad, thank you. Scene cuts to APO. Marshall is doing some soldering work. Grace walks in.\nGRACE: You wanted to see me?\nMARSHALL: Oh, yeah, hey! Agent Grace! (he puts the soldering pen down and then takes his protective glasses on) Listen, I was doing some housekeeping: logging aliases, uh, safe house authorisation, family contacts. You know. The sucky part of my job. (Grace cracks a little smile) And I came across... a mistake in your file so I contacted Langley, turns out I don't have a proper clearance to my own job.\nGRACE: What did you find?\nMARSHALL: Marriage certificate from 7 years ago. Listen, if it supports just an outdated alias I probably ought to resend it sooner or later... you know.\nGRACE: (shaking his head a little) It's not a mistake. I was married.\nMARSHALL: Really. I'm sorry, I never heard you mention that.\nGRACE: For three years. Didn't work out.\nMARSHALL: Totally understand that. I mean, it's a - it's a struggle to -\nGRACE: (curtly) Hey do me a favour. Next time you have a question about my personal life, why don't you call me before Langley?\nMARSHALL: (stupefied) Absolutely. I - I'm really sorry. His computer starts beeping.\nMARSHALL: Uh oh. Camera pans to the computer screen:\nBreached apx: Currenttime }{ - 0400 hours\nDocuments Compromised: Agnet Mortality Logs Contact Protocol Database Audio Field Journals Biometries logs and tables >> additional undetermined docs. Perpetrator identified as [pf21] Prophet Five ...\nGRACE: I'll get Jack. (He walks away.) Cuts to APO briefing room. Jack is standing up while Sydney, Dixon, Grace, Marshall and Rachel sits around the table.\nJACK: Four hours ago an agency facility storing closed matters was breached. (He presses on a button and the screen displays Peyton) Security cameras identifies the perpetrator as an operative of Prophet Five.\nRACHEL: Kelly Peyton.\nDIXON: Do we know what she took?\nJACK: Among the archives, were files of all our agents killed in the line of duty. Their contact protocols, audio field journals biometric read-outs (Sydney *looks* at him)\nSYDNEY: They were Vaughn's files, weren't they? (He looks at her) You were going to have to say it eventually.\nJACK: (nods) Yes, that's right. Sydney looks at him then looks away.\nDIXON: Why would they want Vaughn's files?\nJACK: Isn't clear at the moment, which leaves us in a vulnerable position.\nSLOANE: Vaughn's investigations of Prophet Five were off-the-books; it's unlikely he kept those records on CIA files.\nJACK: I've tasked Tom and Marshall on disabling all of Vaughn's official protocols. (he looks at Dixon) I'll like you to locate any of his old contacts to ensue a warning. Sloane will oversee Rachel in analysing the remainder of the intel.\nSYDNEY: Me? (She looks on, earnest)\nJACK: Though I would prefer to keep you close by, I know that's not an option. (There's a hint of a smile as he talks to Sydney. She gives him a \"Well, what can you do about me?\" look) Given her intimate knowledge of Prophet Five and her association with Vaughn, you should meet with Renee Rienne (Sydney nods) and see if she has any idea of what they may be looking for.\nSYDNEY: Yup, okay. (She collects the files and starts to leave. The others follow suit.) The camera pans to Sloane for a moment before moving back to Jack.\nJACK: Sydney. (She stops in front of him) You should know, when it comes to Vaughn... I take it quite personally. She nods.\nSYDNEY: I know, dad.\nJACK: We're gonna fix this. It's the expression of eternal gratitude again. She walks away abruptly, and the camera focuses on Jack... It's almost as if he has got something up his sleeves...\nCut to some technician's place. It's Peyton's office. On someone's screen there are Vaughn's photos (the one the other man from Welcome to Liberty Village superimposed on the diver's suit). Peyton strides across the office.\nPEYTON: (to a group of people) Anything?\nWOMAN: Listen to this. (Peyton walks to her cubicle)\nPEYTON: The location?\nWOMAN: Not quite. But I think Vaughn shared it with Sydney Bristow. Peyton puts on the earphones.\nVAUGHN ON RECORDING: And I met this afternoon to discuss the protocol for her SD-6 counter-missions. I briefed Agent Bristow on the full scope of the operation. How far it reaches.\nPEYTON: Go back.\nVAUGHN ON RECORDING: I briefed Agent Bristow on the full scope of their operation. How far it reaches.\nWOMAN: She knows where it is. Cuts to DeSantis.\nDESANTIS (on the phone): And you're certain Agent Vaughn communicated this intelligence to her? Cuts to Peyton.\nPEYTON: Yes, according to his own CIA report. (she has a pleased look on her face) but it was several years ago. There's no guarantee Sydney will remember.\nDESANTIS: (over the phone) That's of no concern. (Cuts to him) An associate of mine will be able to refresh her memory. I'll forward you the contact protocols of Doctor Gonsalo Boris. He is going to ask for a lot of money. Tell him I will pay half. Have him waiting for me at the Athena facility.\nPEYTON: Then, you're suggesting that we abduct Sydney Bristow. (over the phone) Which you realise might compromise our larger agenda.\nDESANTIS: We've been searching for more than 30 years and this is the closest we've come to retrieving Horizon. (over the phone) If Sydney Bristow can tell us where it is, we must act immediately. It's a chance we have to take. Peyton switches off the call connection.\nMA[D]RID\nExt. The busy streets of Madrid. The camera pans to a park, and a group of giggling school girls walk past Sydney, who is sitting on a bench. She looks around. Renee arrives.\nSYDNEY: Hello Renee.\nRENEE: You look beautiful. Sydney looks down at her stomach.\nSYDNEY: Doctor says it's my last week to fly.\nRENEE: (sits down beside Sydney) Which means this is a special visit.\nSYDNEY: Prophet Five is targeting some of Vaughn's CIA files. I need to know, did he make a record of your investigation?\nRENEE: No. It was all in our heads. (Sydney looks a little disappointed)\nSYDNEY: Then was there anything that Vaughn was working on, or - or any leads, or contacts that might be of value to Prophet Five now?\nRENEE: What's in the files?\nSYDNEY: Presumably everything he's worked on: SD-6, The Covenant, The Alliance...\nRENEE: Then, no. It's impossible. All he worked on SD-6 ...(Sydney notices two goons coming towards them)\nSYDNEY: (cuts in) Where did you park?\nRENEE: I walked. Why?\nSYDNEY: Let's move. (They get up and walk quickly)\nRENEE: There's a police station at the corner, you'll be safe.\nSYDNEY: Just take it easy, it might be nothing (re: Renee reaching into her pocket to take out her knives) The two goons get their guns out.\nRENEE: Go. Renee turns swiftly and throws her knives like daggers into their hearts and they stumble and fall. Sydney walks in front and screeching tires are heard. She is stopped by a van and two men clothed in black gets hold of her and injects her with a tranquilliser. She is rendered unconscious.\nRENEE: (shouts) Sydney! She sees two black vans driving away and takes out her gun, running after one of the vans. She shoots at the driver, and blood splatters up the windscreen. The van crashes into a car, then she takes out another gun (how many weapons does this woman keep in her pockets anyway?) and starts shooting at the storage space. She opens it and sees Desantis.\nRENEE: You... Where are they taking her? (he doesn't answer, so she shouts) Where are they taking her?\nCUT TO BLACK\nDOCTOR: I just sedated her with a drug (?) cocktail which should take full effects within minutes. (it looks like he is speaking to whoever is behind the one way mirror) It's a chemical process of forced hypnosis which will effectively numb the body but leaves the mind partially lucid, allowing me to access any (camera pans to Sydney) part of her memory you'd like.\nHe walks to his desk again.\nDOCTOR: Which means, it's now time to tell me what it is you're looking for.\nDISTORTED VOICE: First I'd like some prove that this technique would work.\nDOCTOR: Of course. He fiddles with some buttons on the machine that Sydney is hooked up on, then faces Sydney.\nDOCTOR: Tell me your name. Sydney doesn't respond, and the doc tasers Sydney on her chin. She reacts physically.\nDOCTOR: Tell me your name...\nSYDNEY: Sydney Bristow.\nDOCTOR: That's it, girl. Sydney, I want you to remember Michael Vaughn... He uses the taser on her, this time on her forehead, and she reacts physically again.\nDOCTOR: Find him. Sydney is now struggling with her tears and trying her hardest not to cry.\nDOCTOR: Find him and remember the time when you were both happy... A time that was meaningful... Go back, Sydney... Find him... Sydney seems to be resisting, yet the scene transits to flashes of Vaughn in the plane (Search and Rescue)\nSYDNEY: (whisper) Vaughn...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCut to Sydney on the plane. She looks at her safety guard and a weird look is on her face; she adjusts the guard. Vaughn comes forward and sits next to her, just like it was in Search and Rescue.\nVAUGHN: I had it all planned out. (Cut to Sydney's bewildered face)\nSYDNEY: Vaughn...?\nVAUGHN: No, just, please; let me do this.\nSYDNEY: Do what?\nVAUGHN: I was going to take you to the beach, Santa Barbara, go for a walk, maybe; maybe during a sunset. But now, now we're here, and I have no idea (cut to Sydney who is still feeling extremely confused) what we're about to jump into. He reaches into his pocket and fishes the ring box out, opening it for Sydney.\nVAUGHN: I don't know if I'll get another chance to do this.\nSYDNEY: But, Vaughn, we already did this. (She shows him her ring on her finger)\nVAUGHN: (frowning) I don't understand.\nSYDNEY: (as if a light dawns upon her...) I think I do. The people you were looking for. The people behind Prophet Five. I think they're holding me. (she looks around conspicuously)\nVAUGHN: How do you know about Prophet Five?\nSYDNEY: You told me and they shot you.\nVAUGHN: What, they shot me? No, I'm here.\nSYDNEY: I know... They injected me with something, they hypnotised me... Trying to get something out of my head.\nVAUGHN: What?\nSYDNEY: I don't know... But I think they're trying to use (camera cuts to hypnotised Sydney) you against me.\nDOCTOR: Stay with Vaughn, Sydney. Remember the love you feel for him. He uses the taser again, and the scene cuts back on the plane. She looks around.\nSYDNEY: I should go.\nVAUGHN: No. I don't wanna be without you.\nSYDNEY: I know... I miss you. Vaughn notices the lack of a ring on her finger.\nVAUGHN: Look. (She looks at her finger) Sydney Bristow, will you marry me?\nSYDNEY: I - I don't know what I'm supposed to say...\nVAUGHN: You're supposed to say 'yes'. She smiles genuinely.\nSYDNEY: Yes. (Cuts to hypnotised Sydney) I wanna marry you.\nDOCTOR: Ok, we've got it. Now perhaps you should tell me what we're looking for.\n[APO]\nDIXON: There's a call for you on the overseas line. They're following out contact protocol, but I don't recognize the voice.\nJack picks up the phone.\nJACK: This is the director.\nCut to Renee. Desantis is tied to a chair in the background, his chest heaving in his painful attempts to breathe.\nRENEE: Is this Sydney Bristow's father? Scene cut. At the APO briefing table.\nJACK: Prophet Five has Sydney. She was last seen in a black van heading west away from the Salamanca quarter. Rachel, access Madrid's surveillance infrastructure.\nRACHEL: Okay. She walks out.\nJACK: Marshall, monitor all movement through local port and airspace.\nMARSHALL: What's the timeline?\nJACK: She was abducted 40 minutes ago.\nMARSHALL: Well they could be out of the sea limits in 20!\nJACK: Then MOVE!\nMARSHALL: All right. He walks out, too.\nJACK: We're assuming Sydney's captor is connected to something that Prophet Five found in Vaughn's files.\nGRACE: I'll reassess it with that in mind. Grace walks away as well. Sloane and Dixon are the only ones left with Jack.\nJACK: Dr. Aldo Desantis was present at the ambush, which implies they may intend to use Sydney for a medical procedure.\nSLOANE: My God, the baby.\nJACK: Renee Rienne has Desantis in custody. I'm gonna join her and assist with the interrogation.\nDIXON: Do you want me to come with you?\nJACK: No I need you to run operations until I return.\nDIXON: I'll secure a flight to Spain for you. Dixon leaves.\nSLOANE: Where do you need me?\nJACK: You sure you have no means left by which to contact Prophet Five?\nSLOANE: Jack, I told you that Gordon Dean was my only resource. With him dead, I have nothing.\nJACK: Ok. Then use your underworld contacts. The news of a federal agent in captivity may have made the rounds. See if they know anything.\nSLOANE: I'll get right on it. Jack walks away, and off Sloane's face, the scene cuts to him talking on his cell phone on a rooftop\nSLOANE: This is Arvin Sloane. I'd like to speak to Mr. Ehrmann.\n(v.o.): Mr. Ehrmann is not available.\nSLOANE: This is an urgent matter. I need to speak to him.\n(v.o.): You're not playing by the rules, Mr. Sloane, remember, we contact you.\nSLOANE: A pregnant woman's life is at stake. Someone very dear to me.\n(v.o.): The only woman you can save is lying in a hospital bed. May I suggest you pick your battles, sir.\nSLOANE: (slightly desperate) Please! (v.o.) Goodbye Mr. Sloane. The other party hangs up, and Sloane flips his phone in dejection.\nCut to a dark alleyway and then to Jack, knocking on a door. Renee opens, checks if anybody is behind him, and lets him in.\nRENEE: Jack? Do you have anything?\nJACK: Satellites lost her at the city limits. Desantis is strapped to a chair.\nRENEE: If we don't get him to a hospital he's gonna die.\nJACK: Has he given us anything?\nRENEE: Won't talk. I pulled this from his jacket. It's got dates. Addresses. They walk towards him.\nDESANTIS: So this is how you do it. Bringing a man in a suit to scare me into talking?\nJACK: You're right. The suit shouldn't scare you. What should scare you is that I'm a very concerned father. Jack whips out a small knife, walks towards Desantis menacingly... and in one swift motion, he slices Desantis' ear off. Desantis yowls in pain.\nCut to hypnotised Sydney.\nDOCTOR: I'm gonna continue the regressive process, attaching her to a memory of Vaughn then taking her back through time until you get your answer. (He tasers Sydney) Sydney, I want you to remember the last time you were with Vaughn. Think of the comfort you feel when you're with him. Live there, in your memories. He uses the taser Sydney again and we cut to Vaughn lying in his hospital bed, right before he died Sydney sits next to his bed.\nSYDNEY: Vaughn? (she touches his face) Vaughn! He gets out of slumber and she smiles slightly at him.\nVAUGHN: Sorry, I guess I drifted off there. Hey, we should think about more names for the baby.\nSYDNEY: There will be plenty of time for that.\nVAUGHN: I know. What do you think about Oscar?\nSYDNEY: What if we have a girl?\nVAUGHN: I meant for a girl. (small laugh) I wish she were here already. I wanna meet her.\nSYDNEY: You will.\nVAUGHN: I know. Doctor guy enters, and places the cup of water on the sidetable.\nDOC GUY: Are you comfortable?\nVAUGHN: No.\nDOC GUY: When he feels ready, make sure he drinks it slow. Don't overdo, just a sip at a time. I'll be back soon.\nSYDNEY: Thank you.\nVAUGHN: Can I? I'm thirsty. She picks up the drink, about to give it to him when she realises...\nSYDNEY: I gave you this and then you crashed. Vaughn, I can't.\nVAUGHN: Syd, shhh! They can hear us. Come closer. (Syd leans in) You said it yourself. They're using me against you. The only way to defeat them, I need to go away.\nSYDNEY: (trying to control her tears) I don't care. I don't wanna say goodbye to you again.\nVAUGHN: I know. I know. It's ok. I need to go away. We'll find each other.\nCut to the prison in North Korea\nSYDNEY: (in a continuation to Vaughn's previous words) We always find each other\nVAUGHN: Syd?\nSYDNEY: The baby kicked.\nVAUGHN: Really? What's it feel like?\nSYDNEY: Here. (she places Vaughn's hand on her stomach)\nVAUGHN: I don't feel anything.\nSYDNEY: Wait! ...there!\nVAUGHN: No I don't.... THAT? There are enormous grins on their faces.\nSYDNEY: Yeah.\nCut to DOCTOR tasering Sydney again\nDOCTOR: Very good, Sydney. I want you to stay with Vaughn. Cut back to North Korea\nSYDNEY: Don't ever leave me.\nVAUGHN: Never. The guards come in.\nSYDNEY: Where are they taking us?\nVAUGHN: Nowhere good. Vaughn gets up and starts fighting the guards, walking outside... and disappears into thin air. Sydney hears Vaughn's voice coming from a radio one of the guards dropped.\nVAUGHN: Syd!\nSYDNEY: Vaughn?\nDOCTOR (on the radio thing): Don't let him go!\nCut to DOCTOR:\nDOCTOR: I want you to stay with Vaughn, Sydney! He tasers her again.\nCut to North Korea, Syd picks up the radio and hears Vaughn's voice again:\nVAUGHN: Sydney can you hear me?\nSYDNEY: Vaughn, where are you?\nVAUGHN: I...I'm losing... go to Che....\nSYDNEY: Vaughn? Vaughn!\nDOCTOR (on the radio thing): Don't let him leave you, Sydney!\nCut to Sydney's place, back where the episode started. Sydney hears the doctor on her radio.\nDOCTOR: Where is Vaughn? She fills the kettle again, taking it to the stove and examining the teabag. Vaughn comes back in with the groceries.\nVAUGHN: Back!\nCut to Sydney in the torture chair.\nSYDNEY: What took you so long?\nDOCTOR: (pleased) They're back together.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCut to Jack interrogating Desantis\nJACK: Tell me where they have my daughter.\nDESANTIS: I'll tell you nothing.\nJACK: You've been shot. You're lucky you survived the blood loss, though I am prepared to draw this out to the last second, make it as painful as it needs to be, until you tell me where she is.\nDESANTIS: Where she is does not matter. Your concern should be where she is going.\nRENEE: Jack! I found a repeating address in the calendar.\nJACK: Christina Crue 37E. That's in Hungary.\nRENEE: He had it marked three times in the last four months and once on this date. Three weeks from now. (Jack looks over at Desantis) Jack, what is it?\nJACK: That's Sydney's due date. Give me your gun.\nShe hands it to him, and he walks to Desantis: he points the gun to his neck\nJACK: Tell me what is going to happen on Christina Crue 37E.\nDESANTIS: You'll never know.\nJACK: Is Sydney being held there?\nDESANTIS: (chuckles) Oh, of course not.\nJACK: You're lying.\nDESANTIS: Very well. Maybe I am lying.\nJACK: What's. There?\nDESANTIS: You can't do anything to be now. I'm quite prepared to die. Jack loosens his grip on Desantis' head, walks to Renee and hands her her gun.\nJACK: See if he means it. As he walks away, Renee walks towards Desantis - the splitting image of her father...\nJACK: (voiceover) Dixon, it's Jack. (scene cuts to him) I need you to prepare transport to Hungary. Behind him, Renee fires two shots.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Sydney. Think back to a comforting time. The place you were the first time you realise that Vaughn really cared for you.\nSCENE CUTS TO: Pier, night. The exact replica of the famous scene in 1x04, A Broken Heart. The carousel is at the background. Sydney looks at Vaughn, who is looking beyond the ocean, possibly enjoying the zephyr breeze.\nVAUGHN: I forgot how beautiful it is. The ocean. They share a smile.\nSYDNEY: Yeah. We should've come here more often. Her phone rings, and she fishes it out from her bag, bringing it to her ear.\nDOCTOR: (on the phone) Draw me a map. How far it reaches. She looks shocked, then throws it into the Pacific. The phone makes a splash. Vaughn looks at her.\nSYDNEY: They're pushing me closer.\nVAUGHN: What do they want?\nSYDNEY: I don't know.. Something about a map.\nVAUGHN: A map? Her phone rings again...\nDOCTOR: (on the phone) Listen to me. Draw me a map. How far it reaches... She throws it into the Pacific again.\nVAUGHN: (a small laugh) You just threw your phone into the Pacific. Twice.\nSYDNEY: (she laughs) I know. They grin... She looks pleased with herself.... The mood shifts suddenly, a heavy weight in the air.\nVAUGHN: Listen to me. You've got to let me go.\nSYDNEY: (blinks back tears) I can't.\nVAUGHN: You have to.\nSYDNEY: I can't, Vaughn... I can't stand it. Being here without you...\nVAUGHN: Sydney...\nSYDNEY: I feel like I'm losing my mind! I do. (she takes a deep breath) I don't even know who I am anymore, what I'm doing, or why I'm doing it...\nVAUGHN: Okay, stop. You remember the last time we were here? Your contact has just been killed in Morocco and your world was collapsing around you and I told you that even in the middle of all these darkness you could not allow it to swallow you.\nSYDNEY: You gave me strength.\nVAUGHN: Yeah... but the truth is, the truth has always been you are the one who has kept the darkness from overtaking me. You can do this. I know you can do this. I've seen you do this time and time again! Sydney's on the verge of tears.\nVAUGHN: I gotta go. And you are gonna take these guys down. Okay? He touches her face... she is reluctant, but lets him leave; her view of his retreating back getting smaller and smaller.\nDOCTOR: (voiceover) She's fighting the process. I want you to stay with Vaughn, Sydney. He uses the taser on her... She reacts, then the scene cuts to the warehouse. Specifically, the scene is the lie detector scene from 1x08: Time Will Tell.\nVAUGHN: If you don't say goodbye to me, they win.\nSYDNEY: I can't do it on my own.\nVAUGHN: I'm not here. This isn't real. None of this is real. He places his hand on her face again...\nSYDNEY: It's real to me. That's all that matters.\nVAUGHN: No. Don't say that. That's what they want you to say.\nSYDNEY: But do you know what I want? I want the world to forget about us. I'm tired, Vaughn. I'm tired of having this weight on my shoulder. I - I don't want to be the one who has to save the world. I want you back. I want you all to myself. I want to go away, just you and me and our baby; somewhere no one can bother us, on a deserted island. (pause) I want out. Scene cuts to hypnotised Sydney\nSYDNEY: I don't care if they win, Vaughn. I don't care. I just want you to stay with me.\nDOCTOR: That's it. He turns to the one way mirror.\nDOCTOR: We got her.\nDISTORTED VOICE: Excellent. Now I want the map of SD-6. Scene cuts to the blood mobile... Specifically the scene 1x02: And So It Begins.\nSYDNEY: I want no more of these spy crap, I just (she sniffles) ... That's why I went to you in the first place. So just listen to me... And I will give you in record time the names of people who will render SD-6 useless.\nVAUGHN: Record time?\nSYDNEY: Two months, tops, and then I'm out. I walk.\nNote: While she said these lines like they were in And So It Begins, her face tells an entirely different story as her eyes were filled with tears and she struggles to keep them back.\nVAUGHN: Draw me a map of SD-6. And all its allies. How far you think it reaches. Draw me a family tree of SD-6 and how deep it goes. (She looks at him) Just do it! Sydney draws it on a piece of paper... Pushes it towards him. It's the same map she drew. Vaughn stands up and takes the larger map down. He unrolls it.\nVAUGHN: This is what you're in the middle of. This isn't about cutting off the arm of the monster. This is about killing the monster. Scene cuts to the doctor.\nDOCTOR: Focus on the map.\nVAUGHN: The upper right corner. What do you see?\nDOCTOR: There's a name... What is it?\nVAUGHN: Tell me what it is. She doesn't want to... Looking up to Vaughn with glassy eyes, only to be met by his slight smile... Scene cuts to her hypnotised.\nSYDNEY: X23 - Norte.\nDOCTOR: Well done... Scene cuts to Vaughn... who assumes the voice of the doctor.\nVAUGHN: Well done.\nSYDNEY: (hypnotised) (whispering) Vaughn...\nDISTORTED VOICE: Thank you doctor. Then, in the way we all love Alias... The captor's face is revealed: It's Irina. She talks to Peyton.\nIRINA: I'll let my sources know we got the location of The Horizon. I'll be back in a few days. Until then, keep her comfortable. Scene cuts to hypnotised Sydney. Cut to a beautiful tropical beach. Vaughn is waiting in a white suit and Sydney is walking in his direction.\nSYDNEY : Do you hear that?\nVAUGHN : I didn't hear anything.\nSYDNEY : I know. It's great, isn't it? (Sydney catches the left hand of Vaughn) I wish we could stay here like this forever.\nVAUGHN : There's nothing I want more. They're gonna figure it out, Syd. Sooner or later, they're gonna know you gave'em the wrong name. And when they do, I can't be here. They'll keep using me against you. They won't stop until they get what they want. I have to go.\nSYDNEY : I know.\nVAUGHN : We'll find each other. We always find each other. They kiss on this beautiful beach. Cut to hypnotised Sydney, who seems more confident. In Hungary, Jack and Renee are in a black car in front of the building where Sydney is presumably held.\nJACK: Unit three is on the third floor.\nRENEE: The lease expired 16 years ago.\nJACK: Nevertheless. In the laboratory, with the chemicals wearing off, Sydney opens her eyes and finds Peyton unstrapping her. Syd stabs Peyton with the drug and escapes. In Hungary, Jack and Renee, weapons in the hands climb a stair. Meanwhile, still groggy, Sydney finds her way around narrow corridors... Renee and Jack find a room with an empty nursery. No trace of Sydney!\nJACK : Good Lord. Sydney opens a last metallic door, and watches a helicopter flying away. After walking down a red stair, she discovers that she's on a ship at sea.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

I suspect everything.\nDUCKY: Yes, an admirable trait in an investigator. And also the reason your three marriages ended in divorce.\nGIBBS: Oh yeah? All these years I thought it was because I was a b*st*rd.\nDUCKY: Well, of course, that didn't help. There is evidence of hairline fracture on the frontal lobe of the skull.\nGIBBS: Cause?\nDUCKY: Well, it's consistent with most vehicle accidents, possibly from contact with the steering column.\nGIBBS: What about drugs?\nDUCKY: Well, in this state, a toxicological screen would be useless. However, drugs are a possibility.\nGIBBS: Too many of those, Duck. Too many.\nDUCKY: Well, my current opinion is that Lieutenant McAllister met with a tragic accident.

That was the best part of the song.\nGIBBS: Correction. Your ears are broken. What did the divers find?\nABBY: Actually, it's more like what didn't they find. My theory is they're getting paid by the piece. They recovered everything within a twenty meter radius of the vehicle. Sunglasses, golfballs, Rick James eight-track, typewriter. I didn't see any point in bringing the Maytag up from the evidence lockup.\nGIBBS: Anything to do with the case?\nABBY: As a matter of fact, found directly beneath the vehicle... can you hear me now? I might be able to recover some data from the memory chip.\nGIBBS: What about the bullet we brought up from the wreck last night?\nABBY: Forty five caliber, two hundred and thirty grain hardball. Lots and lots of stopping power. The grooving matches a Colt forty-five, old-school military version.\nGIBBS: Did you work up a trajectory, yet?\nABBY: Of course. The bullet's entry angle into the side of the door is obvious as Anna Nicole's implants.\nGIBBS: Who?\nABBY: You know, married that old guy? Had a TV show? Got fat, got thin, got fat, got thin, fat, thin--\nGIBBS: Stop!\nABBY: So using that angle, I back-traced the trajectory. The bullet traveled on this path. So unless he was driving with his feet from the backseat, which is something that I have tried but do not recommend...\nGIBBS: Abby?\nABBY: The round had to have gone through McAllister's body.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. LAB - DAY\nDUCKY: It's entirely possible, Jethro, but if Abby's animation is correct, the bullet passed clean through the thoracic cavity. Unfortunately, without leaving any evidence of its passing.\nGIBBS: Hell of a shot.\nDUCKY: Yeah.\nGIBBS: The vehicle had to be going over seventy to end up where we found it in the lake.\nDUCKY: Well, at that speed a bullet passing through the ribcage without so much as glancing a single bone... huh! A hell of a shot, indeed.\nGIBBS: More like impossible.

(ON CAMERA) Which would make sense if he was heading here to the McAllister Family compound in Shenandoah.\nMCGEE: So he was heading home for the weekend?\nKATE: Another twenty miles and he would have made it, McGee.\nGIBBS: DiNozzo?\nTONY:\nTONY: McAllister's military records are spotless, Boss. Been running background on his family. Mother died in ninety three. Father passed away in two thousand two... three months after the Lieutenant disappeared. The only surviving next of kin is this guy. Thomas McAllister, his younger brother. (CONT.) Washed out of Annapolis freshman year. Arrested a bunch of times for suspected DWI and marijuana possession. Never convicted.\nKATE: Figures, the rich never are.\nTONY: Even richer now, Kate. He inherited everything. He's currently the CEO of his own airline.\nMCGEE: The Good Son and the Bad Seed.\nKATE: Very Biblical.\nTONY: The Navy notified him last night about his brother. CACO said he took it pretty well.\nNCIS WORKER: Lunch!\nKATE: Oh, thank you. I took the liberty of ordering lunch today. Something healthy for once. There you are. They're tofu veggie wraps. They're good, Tony. Abby and I eat them all the time.\nGIBBS: DiNozzo, track down the bad seed. I want to know what he was doing around the time his brother disappeared.\nTONY: Yeah, I already set up an interview for later this afternoon, Boss.\nGIBBS: Take Kate. McGee, contact Cooper. I want to know how he found that vehicle.\nMCGEE: So we're going to cooperate with him?\nGIBBS: No, McGee, he's going to cooperate with me.\nKATE: I'll be right back.

So because I grew up with money that somehow makes me bad. Very deep.\nKATE: Well, it's better than having to work everyday like I had to.\nTONY: Listen, do you think money makes life easier? Huh? Everything was just a big ol' cakewalk for little Anthony DiNozzo? You tell me, Kate, because I really want to know.\nKATE: I'm sorry, Tony. I didn't mean anything by it.\nTONY: Because do you want to know the answer to your question? Yes. Money makes a huge difference. Huge.

I didn't...\nTHOMAS: It's fine. You would have been right a couple years ago. And please, call me Tom.\nKATE: Kate. So, do you own all these planes?\nTHOMAS: Me and the bank. That's my new one out there. I plan on taking it for a test flight today if you're interested.\nTONY: You don't seem too broken up for a guy who just lost his brother, Tom.\nTHOMAS: I've known he's been dead for quite some time, Agent DiNozzo. The first week you expect a ransom note. After a month you pray. A year... you just know.\nKATE: When was the last time you talked to your brother?\nTHOMAS: About three months before the accident. Would you believe we grew up fishing at Black Lake?\nTONY: The thing is it wasn't an accident.\nTHOMAS: The Navy, they said...\nTONY: Your brother was murdered.\nTHOMAS: Are you absolutely positive about that?\nKATE: He was shot on the weekend of October fourth, two thousand two. I'm sorry.\nTONY: Considering his body was found dumped twenty miles from your house, we'd like to know where you were the weekend he disappeared?\nTHOMAS: Me? I was at home.\nTONY: Anyone who can verify that?\nTHOMAS: I was with my father.\nTONY: Let me rephrase. Is there anyone who can verify that is still alive?\nTHOMAS: No. Are you saying you think I did it?\nKATE: We're just following up on any leads we can, Tom.\nTHOMAS: Of course.

Now tell me about your boss. Is he always such a hardass?\nMCGEE: Agent Gibbs? He's a lot like you, actually. In fact, the main character in my book is based on him.\nCOOPER: Oh, yeah.

Yeah. I figured the Lieutenant headed home that weekend. But the back road that he liked to drive... I think it was washed out. Here, take a look at these weather patterns. I spent nine weeks getting these from the National Weather Service. Every Doppler readout, every satellite image I could find. Pocket of storms, real tight, near the road.\nMCGEE: Enough to swell that creek alongside?\nCOOPER: Yeah, but only on that side of the mountain, kid. My educated guess? I think McAllister doubled back, took this road to the other side where the storm hadn't reached yet. See, the locals only use that road when there are bad storms.\nMCGEE: It's right along Black Lake, Boss.\nCOOPER: I figured if somebody wanted to kill him, they had to know the roads and the weather the way McAllister did. And they'd have to know he was coming. Am I right?\n(SFX: ELEVATOR DOORS SLIDE OPEN)\nTONY: I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself.\nKATE: What?\nTONY: Kate Todd acting like a high school girl with a crush.\nKATE: He's not a murderer, Tony.\nTONY: I'm sorry, were you using the new NCIS magical murderer detector back there?\nKATE: My gut.\nTONY: Ah. If you were a guy, I would say you were using--\nKATE: Don't even say it if you want to live!\nGIBBS: What did Thomas McAllister have to say?\nKATE: He hadn't heard from his brother in three months.\nTONY: Definitely hiding something, boss.\nKATE: My best guess, it was grief. There's no way he's involved, Gibbs.\nGIBBS: Abs, what do you have?\nKATE: The last three calls that came in on the phone from the lake were all made on Friday, October fourth.\nGIBBS: Yeah?\nKATE: And they were all from his brother, Thomas McAllister. Sorry, Kate.\n(MUSIC OUT)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. NCIS GARAGE - DAY\n(SFX: TRUNK CLOSES)\nCOOPER: This McAllister family's got more skeletons than a North Korean prison camp, Gibbs.

He decided he was going to contact the dead wife. Starts neglecting the family business.\nGIBBS: What do you mean by make contact?\nCOOPER: He consults this space cadet, Saleena Lockhart. Claimed to be a psychic.\nKATE: I've heard of her. She used to have that tabloid astrology column.\nTONY: I don't buy it.\nKATE: Astrology?\nTONY: No, you reading tabloids.\nCOOPER: She weasels her way into the old man's life. Next thing you know she's practically running it. McAllister Avionics starts to slide until it's almost bankrupt by two thousand.\nGIBBS: How much money did he leave her?\nCOOPER: You're quick, Gibbs. Almost ten million. He changed his will two weeks after the Lieutenant went missing. The surviving brother, still fighting it in court.\nTONY: She's kind of like Anna Nicole.\nCOOPER: Who?\nGIBBS: That's what I said. McGee, run a background on this whack job. I want to know where she is right now.\nMCGEE: On it, boss.\nCOOPER: I know what you're thinking. She didn't do it, Gibbs. This is a smoking gun. Thomas McAllister had a plan to save the family's fortune. He wanted to get out of avionics and into his own airline. And it's a good plan, but it involved leveraging every remaining asset the McAllister's had. The brother didn't agree.\nGIBBS: The Lieutenant was cashing out of the company?\nCOOPER: And going his own way. This is the contract divesting him of all family business.\nGIBBS: How'd you get this?\nCOOPER: You don't want to know. What you want to do is look at the date.\nGIBBS: October fifth, two thousand two.\nCOOPER: The weekend he vanished. Luckily for the little brother, he didn't sign the contract.\nGIBBS: I don't believe in luck.\nCOOPER: Neither do I. So when are you bringing McAllister in?\nGIBBS: I'm not.\nCOOPER: What?! But it's all there! Motive, opportunity, the calls on the Lieutenant's cell phone.\nGIBBS: When you were a cop, did you let civilians lay out your cases? Or did you work them yourself?\nCOOPER: NCIS has had this case for two years. How long am I supposed to wait?\nGIBBS: 'Till I'm done! You are looking for the reward.

Can I get a green tea, please?\nGIBBS: How does it work?\nSALEENA: Well, I get impressions, feelings. I don't get specific details.\nGIBBS: Do you have any feeling about his father including you in his will?\nSALEENA: I didn't ask him.\nGIBBS: I'm not a psychic, but considering he was a fighter pilot, I'd say he'd be pretty pissed off about it.\nSALEENA: Your point, Agent Gibbs?\nGIBBS: Where were you the weekend Lieutenant McAllister was murdered?\nSALEENA: Luray. Luray Caverns. I was hosting a spiritual retreat.\nTONY: Luray? Hey boss, isn't that about fifteen miles from Black Lake?\nGIBBS: Can you tell me what I'm thinking now, Miss Lockhart?\nSALEENA: I don't have to be a psychic to tell that.

The episode follows the investigation of a murder case in which a man named Brian McAllister was killed in a car accident. The team of NCIS agents, led by Gibbs, discovers that the bullet that killed McAllister was not the same one that was used in a previous murder case. The team suspects that the bullet was planted in McAllister's car to frame him for the murder. The team eventually discovers that the bullet was planted by a private investigator named Cooper, who was trying to collect a reward for finding the murderer of a Navy Lieutenant. The team also discovers that Cooper was wearing gloves and had a trademark trench coat to hide his gun residue. The team eventually arrests Cooper and collects the reward.</s>package com.example.android.miwok;"

Look at that.\nDOCTOR: You shrank the wrong man, Drax.\nDRAX: No, I was aiming at you.\nDOCTOR: Why didn't you shrink the mute? The TARDIS door's open.\nDRAX: Right, I've got it. Now listen. One of us creates a diversion and you fly over there and shut the door.\nDRAX: Nasty. Yeah, and we can't use the dimensional stabiliser in here 'cos there's not enough room for when we get back to normal size. We'd just fill up the crack.\nDOCTOR: Like putty.\nDRAX: Do you mind? Yeah, you've got problems.\nDOCTOR: Yes. The door's open so the Shadow can go in there and take the Key to Time. Romana can't help and the time loop must be at breaking point by now.\nDOCTOR: When the countdown reaches zero, up goes Atrios, Zeos and all.\nDRAX: Life presents a dismal picture, you might say.\nDOCTOR: Yes, you might say that. And of course there's the Marshal.\nDRAX: The Marshal? He's on our side.\nDOCTOR: No.\nDRAX: No. Oh well. Where's he fit in?\nDOCTOR: He's in the time loop as well, making a rocket attack on Zeos. Unless, of course, Shapp and Merak get in contact with him.\nDRAX: Where are they?\nDOCTOR: Back on Atrios, I hope.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSHAPP: Atrios control to Marshal. Marshal? Come in, Marshal. Oh, it's useless. He either can't or won't answer. And this time loop device isn't going to hold things back for ever, is it.\nMERAK: No, not unless the Doctor can find the sixth piece, and the sixth piece is somehow connected with Astra.\nSHAPP: But she denies all knowledge of it?\nMERAK: All conscious knowledge, yes. But if she's the only one who knows then secret, and if the knowledge is implanted, then it must have affected her, made her different in some slight way that might just show up in analysis.\nSHAPP: Yes, but she's not here.\nMERAK: But her records are, on your computer.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMARSHAL: Fire!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDRAX: Well, we've got one thing in our favour.\nDOCTOR: Oh?\nDRAX: Mobility.\nDOCTOR: Mobility.\nDRAX: Well, if we're only this high, we're practically invisible, aren't we?\nDRAX: Except we daren't move.\nDOCTOR: Yes. If the Shadow gets the five pieces from the TARDIS, which he undoubtedly will, it's up to us to get the sixth piece.\nDRAX: Yeah, but you don't know what it looks like, do ya? I reckon you're banjaxed, my old son. End of the road. Finito.\nDOCTOR: The Shadow said I'd already seen it. It must be Astra.\nDRAX: Astra?\nDOCTOR: She must have it. Let's see where this crack leads, shall we?\nDRAX: It's better than getting the boot.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSHADOW: The Doctor has eluded me, but he has made his last mistake. See, the door is open! The Key to Time is mine! Enough! Bwahahahaha!\nROMANA: He thinks we're just going to stand by and let him walk away with everything we've worked for. Come on, let's get out of here.\nASTRA: In this place.\nROMANA: What?\nASTRA: My destiny is here, in this place. Not on Atrios, not on Zeos. Here.\nROMANA: Astra, listen. You're not under the Shadow's influence any more. Now, let's get out of here before he comes back.\nASTRA: No, I must stay. I am the sixth princess of the sixth dynasty of the sixth Royal House of Atrios.\nROMANA: Yes, yes, but we must get out of here before the Shadow comes back!\nASTRA: This is the time of my becoming, my transcendence.\nROMANA: What are you talking about?\nASTRA: Metamorphosis.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDRAX: Yeah, here we are. Right, now, there's the T junction. Right down to the dungeon, left onto the Shadow's lair.\nDOCTOR: What? You mean there's a way in he doesn't know about?\nDRAX: Well, it will be when it's finished, but a couple of midgets like us won't be much good on a pick and shovel, will we?\nDOCTOR: No. No, no. no. But if we get K9 up there, we won't need a pick and shovel, will we. We can still give the Shadow a surprise.\nDRAX: Well, let's normalise then, shall we?\nDOCTOR: No, no, Drax, no. Small is lovely.\nDRAX: Big is better, though, innit?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSHADOW: Now, the moment I have waited for! Open the door.\nSHADOW: Light! Too much light! You, fetch me the Key. Hurry.\nSHADOW: When the Key is mine, I shall dispel the light, and darkness and night shall reign.\nSHADOW: Ah.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nASTRA: Destiny. My destiny is near.\nROMANA: Astra, remember you're the sixth princess of the sixth Royal House of the sixth dynasty.\nROMANA: And we're looking for the sixth segment of the Key to Time. Oh, you're in greater danger even than we imagined.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSHAPP: Have you found it?\nMERAK: I think so, yes.\nSHAPP: What is it?\nMERAK: A molecular anomaly buried in the genetic structure of the Royal House of Atrios and passed from one generation to the next, until finally, Astra.\nSHAPP: What's it mean?\nMERAK: I imagine it means that her every living cell is part of this Key of Time, and that to save us, Astra must be destroyed. You see?\nSHAPP: Hey, where are you going?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Everything all right, K9?\nK9: Affirmative.\nDOCTOR: Control box in position?\nK9: Control box in position.\nDOCTOR: Batteries charged?\nK9: Affirmative.\nDOCTOR: Test the blaster, K9.\nDRAX: Ow!\nDOCTOR: Blaster working, K9?\nK9: Affirmative.\nDOCTOR: You all right, Drax?\nDRAX: Just about. That bit gets hot.\nDOCTOR: I'd sit somewhere else, if I were you. Ready, K9?\nK9: Affirmative.\nDOCTOR: Now remember, it's absolutely vital to convince the Shadow that you're still under his control. This whole plan depends on how well you can act. Got it?\nK9: Affirmative, master.\nDOCTOR: Keep it simple, K9.\nK9: The Doctor and Drax have been eliminated.\nDOCTOR: Okay, K9. Now forward. You're on.\nK9: Master.\nDOCTOR: Did you ever get to Troy, Drax? Little place in Asia Minor.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMERAK: The third planet. Show me.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSHADOW: The fulfillment of that for which I have waited since eternity began.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nK9: Preparing for blasting.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSHADOW: You see, Princess, you cannot escape your destiny.\nASTRA: My destiny.\nSHADOW: It is for this that you were born. The sixth child of the sixth generation of the sixth dynasty of Atrios. Born to be the sixth and final segment of the Key to Time. Come, Princess, prepare yourself.\nASTRA: I am ready.\nSHADOW: Ah!\nMERAK: Astra!\nSHADOW: What is this?\nK9: Apologies, master.\nSHADOW: You mechanical idiot.\nK9: But there is an intruder here.\nSHADOW: I ordered her to eliminate him.\nK9: It shall be done.\nSHADOW: Wait. Where is the Doctor?\nK9: Ahem. The Doctor and Drax have been eliminated.\nSHADOW: Good. Then these two shall stay and witness my moment of glory, my apotheosis.\nK9: (quietly) Master.\nSHADOW: Mine at last!\nK9: Now, master.\nROMANA: No, you'll break the time loop!\nMERAK: Millions will die!\nSHADOW: A small beginning. Bwahahahahaha!\nDOCTOR: The stabiliser, Drax, now!\nSHADOW: You interfering fool. No one can resist the power of darkness!\nDOCTOR: Quick, back to the TARDIS! Quick!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDRAX: You go on, Doctor. I'll hold them off.\nDOCTOR: How will you get back?\nDRAX: The transmat shaft. See you on the TARDIS.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSHADOW: Stop him! He must be stopped! Stop him!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Good.\nROMANA: Come on, Merak.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Romana. Merak, get inside!\nMERAK: No!\nDOCTOR: Quick, get inside, man!\nMERAK: No, Doctor, I'm staying here.\nDOCTOR: What!\nMERAK: I'm staying here to look for Astra.\nROMANA: But what about the Shadow?\nMERAK: Astra! Astra!\nDOCTOR: No, Romana, come on.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Set the coordinates for Zeos.\nROMANA: We're murderers. First Astra and now Merak.\nDOCTOR: Romana, it wasn't our idea to use the Royal House of Atrios as carriers, was it?\nROMANA: No, but what happened to Astra was our fault. We're just pawns here to do the Guardian's dirty work.\nDOCTOR: I don't like it any more than you do, but it's done. Have you set those coordinates yet?\nROMANA: Is that all you can say? She was a living being, and now what is she? A component. And Merak thinks she's still alive. No power should have that right, not even the Guardians. We must do something!\nDOCTOR: Well, you could start by setting the coordinates for Zeos.\nROMANA: Why?\nDOCTOR: Romana, you get carried away. If you don't set those coordinates, millions of people will die and this time it really will be our fault. Have you forgotten the time loop?\nROMANA: No, I hadn't forgotten the time loop. Can't you put the new segment in?\nDOCTOR: In less than a second?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Quick, cutters. Cutters!\nDRAX: Here, what a mess in here.\nDOCTOR: Listen, Drax. Drax, don't just stand there. What colour?\nDRAX: Green, I think.\nDOCTOR: What?\nDRAX: Well, it's a long time since I done it. Er.\nROMANA: Quickly, Drax.\nDRAX: Just a minute. Don't fluster me.\nROMANA: Hurry!\nDRAX: I've got a diagram somewhere.\nDOCTOR: Drax!\nROMANA: Drax!\nDOCTOR: Drax!\nDRAX: Right.\nROMANA: Drax!\nDOCTOR: Drax!\nDRAX: Pyramid, green! I told you.\nDRAX: Well, you didn't have to make such a mess of it all.\nDOCTOR: Drax. You took your time. Where's K9?\nDRAX: We found young Merak lying there dead to the world. Carrying him slowed us right down.\nDOCTOR: Really. How is he?\nDRAX: Well, he'll live.\nROMANA: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nROMANA: Aren't we forgetting something?\nDOCTOR: I don't think so.\nROMANA: The Marshal!\nDOCTOR: What? The Marshal.\nROMANA: Come on!\nDOCTOR: Quick!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMARSHAL: Fire!\nMARSHAL: Taste the moment of victory. Any second now, beautiful mushrooms will blossom and burst.\nMARSHAL: No! No, it's the wrong target!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSHADOW: Sire. Sire. I have failed. The Doctor has accomplished his purpose. He has the Key to Time. I have failed.\nGUARDIAN: I expected no less of you, you whimpering wraith.\nGUARDIAN: But your death is already encompassed in my designs, for now the Doctor shall release the Key to me, and chaos shall break upon the universe!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: What a shot, Marshal! Ha, ha, well shot!\nROMANA: Doctor, he hit the planet of evil and he was aiming at Zeos!\nDOCTOR: Well, I can't help what he was aiming at.\nROMANA: What did you do?\nDOCTOR: A mere nothing. A mere deflective forcefield set up for a millisecond set up between the Marshal and Zeos, bounced the missiles smack onto the planet of evil.\nROMANA: Is that all?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDRAX: Well, he might have told us, mightn't he, dog? We was expecting to get blasted into infinity.\nK9: Affirmative.\nDOCTOR: Well, I'm sorry about that. I don't know what I'm apologising for. I just saved your lives! Can I drop you somewhere, Drax?\nDRAX: No thanks. I've got a contract job on down there.\nDOCTOR: Contract job? No armaments, I hope.\nDRAX: No. Reconstruction, war damage, scrap and that. Me and the Marshal's going fifty-fifty.\nROMANA: You and the Marshal?\nDRAX: Yeah, well, he's out of a job now, isn't he. I mean, no war, no job, so I took him on.\nDOCTOR: When did you arrange this?\nDRAX: In about half an hour's time, I should think.\nDOCTOR: I see. Fifty-fifty?\nDRAX: Well, sixty-forty, know what I mean?\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nDRAX: And if you ever want to get rid of that thing (the complete Key) just let me know, won't you.\nDOCTOR: I'll let you know. Bye, bye, Drax.\nDRAX: Right then. Bye all.\nROMANA: Goodbye.\nDRAX: Remember me to Gallifrey.\nDOCTOR: Bye, bye, Drax.\nROMANA: Goodbye.\nROMANA: Right, I'll set the coordinates for Gallifrey, shall I?\nDOCTOR: Why Gallifrey?\nROMANA: Well, that's where we're going, isn't it?\nDOCTOR: We have the power to do anything we like. Absolute power over every particle in the universe. Everything that has ever existed or ever will exist. As from this moment are you listening to me, Romana?\nROMANA: Yes, of course I'm listening.\nDOCTOR: Because if you're not listening I can make you listen, because I can do anything.\nDOCTOR: As from this moment there's no such thing as free will in the entire universe. There's only my will, because I possess the Key to Time!\nROMANA: Doctor, are you all right?\nDOCTOR: (normal) Well of course I'm all right. But supposing I wasn't all right. This thing makes me feel in such a way I'd be very worried if I felt like that about someone else feeling like this about that. Do you understand?\nROMANA: Yes.\nDOCTOR: What do you understand?\nROMANA: That the sooner we hand this over to the White Guardian\nBOTH: The better!\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): My congratulations to you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, thank you, sir, thank you.\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): You performed your task with admirable dispatch. The universe has much to thank you for.\nDOCTOR: Well, it was a pleasure, sir. Wasn't it a pleasure, Romana?\nROMANA: Doctor, that's not the President.\nDOCTOR: What's the President got to do with it?\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): I can change my form or shape at will, my dear child. I appeared to you as the President so as not to alarm you.\nDOCTOR: Just be careful who you're talking to.\nROMANA: Sorry, I\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): You have the Key to Time, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Oh, I have, I have indeed, sir. Do you like it?\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): Do I like it? Yes, yes, I suppose you could say that I like it.\nDOCTOR: Yes, we're very proud of it, sir. Aren't we, Romana, proud of it?\nROMANA: What? Oh, yes, yes.\nDOCTOR: What happens now, sir? You said, if I remember in our first conversation, that once it was assembled it would stop the entire universe and enable you to restore the natural balances of good and evil throughout the whole of the universe.\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): That is correct, Doctor. So, will you release the Key to me that I may do this?\nDOCTOR: Certainly, sir, yes, certainly, of course. Key to Time, I command you. Could I ask you something, sir?\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It's just that, well, the Key is already assembled, sir. I mean, couldn't you restore the balances now?\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): Yes, Doctor, but I must have the Key for safe keeping. It is an awesomely powerful key.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, sir, yes, and mustn't be allowed to fall into the wrong hands. I quite understand, sir, yes. Key to Time, I command. What about the sixth segment?\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): What about it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Well, I mean, as you know, sir, the sixth segment was in fact a human being, and I mean, if the pieces are maintained in their present pattern it means that she'll be imprisoned forever, sir.\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): That is, of course, regrettable.\nDOCTOR: Very regrettable.\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): But with the fate of the universe at stake.\nDOCTOR: Quite. You can't be too careful. I quite understand. Key to Time, I command that you stay exactly where you are!\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): Doctor! You have fully activated all the TARDIS' defences!\nDOCTOR: We can't be too careful, can we? And it would be a terrible tragedy for the universe if it suddenly turned out that I was colour blind.\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): Doctor, release the Key to me immediately!\nDOCTOR: Unable to distinguish between the White Guardian and the Black Guardian.\nROMANA: Doctor, what do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Look.\nDOCTOR: Don't you see? The White Guardian would never have had such a callous disregard for human life.\nROMANA: Of course. Astra, the sixth segment. He would have dispersed it immediately.\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): Doctor, you shall die for this!\nDOCTOR: I think not. Remember, the Key to Time is still mine, rage all you like.\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): I shall destroy you for this! I will disperse every particle of your being to the furthest reaches of eternity!\nDOCTOR: Ah well, I wish I could stay and watch you try, but you know how it is. Places to go, people to see, things to do. Romana?\nROMANA: Yes?\nDOCTOR: When I give the signal\nROMANA: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Dematerialise.\nDOCTOR: Now!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nASTRA: Hello, Merak.\nMERAK: Astra? Astra, where are you?\nASTRA: I'm here.\nMERAK: Astra.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: You see? I think of everything.\nROMANA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Hmm?\nROMANA: What exactly have you done with the Key to Time?\nDOCTOR: Key to Time? Oh, well, I just scattered it round through space and time.\nROMANA: I see. So where are we going?\nDOCTOR: Going? I don't know.\nROMANA: You have absolutely no sense of responsibility whatsoever.\nDOCTOR: What?\nROMANA: You're capricious, arrogant, self-opinionated, irrational and you don't even know where we're going.\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nROMANA: What?\nDOCTOR: Well, if I knew where I was going, there'd be a chance the Black Guardian would, too.\nROMANA: Oh.\nDOCTOR: Hence this new device.\nROMANA: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Well, it's called a randomiser and it's fitted to the guidance system and operates under a very complex scientific principle called pot luck.\nDOCTOR: Now no one knows where we're going. Not even the Black Guardian.\nROMANA: Not even us.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

I figured I haven't worn it in a while... It needs to go way back, further. Why would I change? Yeah. Why would you change? Why would you wear that?\nKevin: I don't know. Mommy, Daddy, look what I found in the toilet. Where did you get that, sweetheart? I made it. You made that? You made it? Yes, you did.\nKevin and Jenny: Don't squeeze it. That was sh1t. She has sh1t in her hand. Mm-hm. Why is she picking up sh1t? I've read about this before. It's like fun with feces. Fun with feces? I've taken dumps before. It's fun, you take a picture of it. Send it to friends. Disgusting. You don't whip it around your head like a churro. Just let her grow out of it. You're the mother, deal with this. Don't tell anybody. I'm not gonna tell anyone. Nobody knows about this poop situation. Obviously.\nEllie: I'm putting it in the kitchen. Okay, honey... No, no, no, baby, don't. To two of my good friends. Mr. Frank Gore and Mr. Andre Johnson. Leading the Double Ent-Andres to victory. This is my worst nightmare. Losing to you. I was expecting a little bit of a challenge this week. But your team is so terrible. Oh, stop. This is like Freaky Friday. Like, Kevin has gone into Andre's body. The roles have reversed. Guess what. I'm your mother, but I'm cool now. What do you mean? You reversed roles and he's crushing you. I'm Jamie Lee Curtis, you're Lindsay Lohan. I'm cool, you're not. This is what I lost to?\nPete: Wow. You know, I do talk a lot of smack, guys, but it's only because I can: [BEEPING] What does that mean?\nAndre: Back it up. I can back up my smack talk, my friend.\n[PETE & ANDRE BEEPING]\nOkay, really? Stereo? When the guy's right, he's right. Knows what he's doing. Hi, I got off the phone with the out-of-towners. Vince would like me to give you the number for a shelter... because Andre beat your ass so bad. That's nice. All this can be fixed. All you have to do is win. I will win, okay, but there's something strange going on here. Can I just say, next week, I would like to extend an invitation to you... to watch the games at my house and have a meal provided by my lovely wife. I have not been invited over since the arrival of The First Human Child. Have you been? I don't know if I have security clearance. I don't. Do you? No, I haven't been through the scanners. We got a dog. Ellie can play with the dog. You've got a dog?\nRuxin: Come over. Enjoy my home, watch the games. It will be lovely. That'd be exciting.\nRuxin: Yeah, Sofia's excited. She's gonna be cooking some famous dish. That should be good. Oh, Sofia's gonna be there. Yeah, my wife's gonna be at my house.\nTaco: Oh, cool. I haven't seen her in a while. She's fun, she's cool.\nAndre: You want us to bring anything? Yeah. You know what you can bring is a condom... so that you can just go to town on Kevin like you did last week.\n[ANDRE BEEPING]\nBacking it up. It's all right, buddy. How's your lineup looking?\nPete: It's not good. It is listed as questionable. Questionable, what does that mean? No one knows what that means. It's like if I start him, and he doesn't play... I have nothing in the bank, got no backups.\nI'm screwed.\nYeah, you have no outs. They know if they're playing. They know. They should tell us. We should have a direct phone line to these guys. Not to mention, I'm playing Andre this week.\nAnd rumor is, he actually beat someone last week.\nI mean, can you imagine losing to that guy? Are you happy now? Are you finished? You've really... You've done enough to my psyche. It could happen to anyone, all right? Gotta go. All right, bye. Hey, you. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I had a couple meetings. I'm in between. Great to see you. Let's go grab a drink.\nAndre: I, um... You know what, I can't because I have to do a house-call thing. You're a plastic surgeon. Yeah. Do you have, like, an emergency spider vein, or a tit popped or something like that? What happened? Good one. I'd love to hang out, but I gotta do this. Kidding aside, I gotta say something. Uh, we break your balls about the league... but you're really doing well and I'm happy for you. Well, guess what. I've always been this good. I've always been a champion. And you know what I've been doing is I've been sowing and now I'm reaping. Planting the seed and then I've grown into a beautiful flower... and now everyone wants to smell me. So smell it?\n[SNIFFS]\nYou smell that? What? It's bullshit, man. Oh, really? You're out there. I see you. You're out there. You got your games you're playing.

Ah, yes, it's, uh, the smell of jealousy... with a tinge of admiration... and just a whiff of sadness.\nGood luck because I'm gonna: [ANDRE BEEPING] Oh, here we go. Back it up. Back it up. What's up, Dre? Oh, what's up, ballers?\nJd: Dre. What's up, man? High-five.\nJd: There he is.\nRobert: Oh, yeah, buddy. All right. Dr. Dre, you are killing it. You are dominating this league. Tell me something I don't know. Andre Potter and the Fantasy Zone is coming for you. All right, so watch out. This week I'm up against you. I know you're gonna beat me. I dominate the waiver wire. Andre, I thought maybe this week...\nAndre: Whoa. What'd you call me? l... Andre.\nAndre: No, no, no. Here I'm Dre, okay? I'm sorry. Heh. I'm so sorry.\nAndre: All right? Hey, it's cool.\nMan: You accept my apology? Accepted. We were thinking of going to Hammer's house in Wrigleyville, just hanging. Watching all the games... No, guys. No Sundays. We'll do the weekend afterwards. No Sundays. How many times do I have to tell you? Wanna talk on Sundays, don't call me. Text me. We'll take it.\nAndre: There you go. Yeah, we're good. Let's all agree that we are The League of Extraordinary Fantasy Gentlemen. No, no, instead of The League of Extraordinary Fantasy Gentlemen... I think that we should change it to The Fantasy League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Oh, triple snap. Right? Boom, boom, boom! Boom, boom, boom!\nPete: All right, LT. How's the ankle, bud? Questionable. Questionable. What does that tell me? All right. You wanna play it that way? All right, that's fine. Hi, this is Pete. I'd like to speak with Terry Bradshaw, please. Yeah, it's a personal matter so just returning his call. Hey, is Bradshaw around? Yeah, Pete needs him. Hi, I have Peter calling for Mr. Bradshaw. Pete. P-E-T-E, for Terry. Yeah, it's Uncle Pete. Let me talk to Terry.\nMan: Hey, Pete, it's Terry. Hi, Terry. Hey, Uncle Pete, is everything all right?\nIs there a problem?\nUh, no, no problem. But, you know, I was just...\nI was thinking about football...\nI was actually worried about IT this weekend. This is not my Uncle Pete. No, it's me, it's Uncle Pete. Come on. You used to sit on my lap, pony rides, Pete. No, my Uncle Pete had his larynx taken out. He talks through a hole in his neck now. It's a miracle. Cut the crap, buddy, all right? You think I've never been pumped for some fantasy-football information? I once had a policeman... pull me over just to see whether or not he should start Kurt Warner... or Donovan McNabb. Just hook me up once, please. Is LT gonna play? You got some balls, kid. Two small ones but I'm trying to use them.\nI do admire that.\nI'll answer your question. Yes, definitely. Yes?\nAbsolutely.\nStarting, good shape. I am sending you a fruit basket, sir. Thank you. You know this number? Yes, sir. Lose it. Thank you, sir, thank you. Bradshaw on the phone, LT on the field. Unstoppable.\nRuxin: Oh...\nSofia: Hi. Almost game time. Let's do it.\nRuxin: Hold your horses. Hold your horses, okay? We gotta talk some ground rules. If you don't mind sanitizing your hands before you see baby Jeffrey. Don't ask these people, tell them. Cover yourself in this. Put it on the rug rat. Taco, take a bath in it. Can I drink it?\nPete: It's like holy water. Let us all anoint our hands before we touch the baby Jesus... for he has come to save the world. You joke, but it's true.\nTaco: Oh, hey.\nPete: Oh, yeah. It's a baby. Look at the baby. Goodness. He's beautiful.\nSofia: He is.\nJenny: He's wonderful. Yeah. Beautiful? He's got the Ruxin face.\n[GROANING]\nWe used to be two. Now we're a Holy Trinity.\nTaco: It's beautiful. How'd your mom like the christening? I told her the church was like a really progressive synagogue. Who did you go with for godparents? It was supposed to be Pete and Meegan until: [IMITATES EXPLOSION]\nSofia: Yeah. Just because I'm single that doesn't disqualify me from being a godparent. Seriously, I have been a great godfather to Ellie. Have I not? Whoa, I thought I was Ellie's godfather.\n[JENNY CLEARS THROAT]\nRuxin: Yeah.\nYes, you know, you are. I was thinking of something different, and you're a great godfather. Yeah, because when you guys die of cancer, car accident, whatever... I'm gonna move into your house. Bring my puzzles, my slingshot, my Sega Genesis. Gonna hang out with Ellie all day. It's gonna be awesome. Taco, I'm gonna be around a long time, okay? Yeah, but she probably won't. I'm standing right here. I'm just saying that... Unless the son of Ruxin starts spouting off the scores, I think... All right, you're excused. Thank you.\nSofia: Yes. Get all single men out of here. Anyone with communicable diseases. So, Jenny... Suck it, Ruxin. Hi, buddy. Hi, buddy. Yeah. Ellie, you wanna meet Jeffrey?\nKevin: Come here, sweetie. Step up and say hello. Hello. Ellie is such an angel.\nJenny: Thank you.\nSofia: She is so well behaved.\nJenny: She is so smart. They pick up things at that age.\nKevin: Oh, yeah. She picks everything up. Picks it up and she moves... She's brilliant. I have some snacks for you guys, but please don't fill up. I have a very big, delicious lunch coming up. Sounds good. Nice TV. Need help in the kitchen? I do. Well, let's do it, girlfriend. All right, Taco, bring it on.\nTaco: What do we got here?\nKevin: Easy does it, sweetheart. Be easy. Oh, look at this.\nRuxin: Hey.\nKevin: Oh, hi. Guys, everybody, this is Cale.\nPete: What? I love Cale. Can I pet him? Ellie, go outside. You named your dog Cale? Yeah. I told you in confidence that we were trying to have another baby. If it was a boy, we wanted to name it Cale. It's a great name. We can share the name. No, we're not sharing Cale. No, I'm not... The dog looks like a Cale. I mean, look at him, he's a Cale. I hate you. You screwed me here. Because now, instead of Cale, we're gonna have to name him after one of her uncles. What's that name? Moral. Moral MacArthur. He sounds like a Civil War general. Can you change your dog's name? This dog's real, your baby's hypothetical. And I think a mistake.\nKevin: Dick. Sorry, I can't talk to you right now, bye.\nKevin: Oh, God.\n[ALL BOOING]\nHey, your week two champion has arrived.\nKevin: Oh, stop, all right? It's week three. Get over it, sit down.\nAndre: Center seat for the winner. Sit down. There's a crack. You wanna sit there? Watch it.\nJenny: Just go.\nPete: Pick a nice seat there.\nKevin: Get here on time. That's Cale's seat, but I'll let you sit in it. By the way, awesome name. Great dog.\nRuxin: Thanks. Ruxin, why are we watching a baby in picture-in-picture here? What's happening? I got Jeffrey on the baby cam there, so we can watch him... while the game is going on. Wait, that's baby Jeffrey? Yeah. I heard if you look directly at him, he'll blind you. The Ark of the Covenant, he melts your face. That smells delicious. You're a good helper, Taquito. Oh, merci.\nSofia: Here, let me taste, let me taste. Mm-hm. Good? Good? Here. All it needs is for you to try it. Ahh. Weird to you at all? This?\nSofia: You're so awesome. No. There's a man in your kitchen performing your husbandly duties with your wife. Doesn't bother you? Does it bother me... that Taco is in my kitchen blanching carrots... while I'm out here drinking beer and watching football? No. No, it doesn't bother me. I do not have a great butt. You do have a great butt. I have a theory. So in horse racing, oftentimes they'll bring in a lesser horse... get the mare all riled up, excited, feeling it. And right as he's about to blow, they yank him out... and bring in the breeding stallion. Hello. Heh, heh. You have a great butt. You got that Latin butt going on, seriously. So Taco's essentially your teasing stallion? Nailed it. Don't you spank me. Don't you spank me. Wait, I noticed that you're starting it this week. That's a bold choice, right?\nJenny: You played it this week? Yeah, of course I did. How do you know he's gonna play? I feel pretty confident about it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[CELL PHONE RINGING]\nSweet ringtone. You changed it from Limp Bizkit? Yep. Hey.\n[LAUGHS]\nHey, hey, giggly, it's rude to talk on the phone in front of your friends. This is the third call.\nAndre: Hold on one sec? Are you dealing now? What's happening? Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. He didn't know it was a bye week? Oh, dude, I am going to crush the Hammer. I gotta go, man. I can't talk to you, it's...\n[KEVIN CLEARS THROAT]\nUm, I gotta go. What you doing? Checking out these books. Yeah? Who you talking to? No one. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Who you talking to? I'm in another league. I knew it. How long have you been in it? Is this serious?\nAndre: I love it. I'm a king there, they love me. What? And it's been the best three weeks of my life. They don't make fun of me. They like me. They think I'm funny... Settle down a bit, we're gonna... We're hearing you, and we're gonna try harder. You're gonna stop making fun of my teeth? No. Yes. You're not gonna keep on making jokes? You mean that the semen's dissolving all the enamel? I knew it. Go ahead, laugh. I know it's in there.\nPete: Don't laugh. Yeah, laugh it up.\nPete: That wasn't funny. You're right. It's hilarious to you guys. But I have a disease. A periodontal disease. I can show you the prescriptions I have for a special toothpaste. So does my grandfather. I'm sorry. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Those guys, you know what they say? \"Oh, Andre, is that too hot for you? Oh, Andre, we care about your enamel.\" Do they say, \"Oh, Andre, can we shoot it in the back of your mouth\"?\nPete: We're getting off track here. Sometimes we're not the best at expressing our emotions. But that's why you belong. You're the glue that holds the whole group together. You're the centerpiece. You're like the honeydew in a fruit salad, you know. Nobody likes the honeydew. But you need it because it fills up space. The point he's saying is this is less about you than it is about us. Without you, we'd eat our own, man. Can I bring maybe one of those guys? No, not a chance. No.\nPete: We need you to take care of this. Want you to call those guys, break up with that league. Okay. Well, we'll see. You know what's important. Make that call. Yes, Maurice Jones-Drew, three touchdowns. Give me some sugar. Yeah. Hey, where's Ellie? Seriously? Yeah. I put her down for a nap a half-hour ago. Oh, good thinking. Lunch is ready.\nJenny: Awesome.\nPete: Food.\nJenny: It smells really good, Sofia. Fantastic.\nKevin: Get some food and head back to the table. Nope. Uh-uh. That's not lunch. Follow me. Where are we going? You guys are in for quite the treat. Lots of yum-yums for your tum-tums.\nSofia: Ta-da!\nAndre: All right.\nSofia: Have a seat. Is it just like grab a plate and then...\nPete: Exciting. No, you sit down. Have a seat.\nKevin: Great. This is Sunday, relax. It's a long lunch, and we have lots of food coming out. First course is shrimp cocktail. Enjoy. Thanks, Sofia. Looks great. Thanks. Thank you. First course? First course? What? Of how many? Don't know. Three or four. Goods not as advertised, Ruxin. Excuse me, I apologize if I wanted to bask in the reflective glow of my close friends. We wanna watch the football games. What are you doing? f*ck you, Ruxin!\nKevin: Jesus, Andre. Look, guys, relax. Look, my wife is in the mood to cook a Sunday lunch. If I'm not allowed to watch the games, none of you can watch the games. That's very sweet, thank you. I have put the games on pause. All we need to do is respect the pause. That doesn't work. We just need to go on an information lockdown. Doesn't work. I don't trust you. This one's a spy. Me? You don't trust me? I don't trust him, look at that shirt. I don't trust myself in my heart. I don't trust any of you, but I'm willing to try. Don't touch me. We need to police each other... like in Communist Russia. This is gonna be, like, football Gestapo. No, that's Germany. They both got it done.\n[TACO IMITATING AIRPLANE ENGINE]\nSalad plane, coming through.\nSofia: You're so funny.\nKevin: Yes.\nRuxin: All right. Second part of course one, guys, let's get those greens. Sofia thought that maybe we should do this buffet-style.\nPete: Good idea. Let's do it.\nSofia: He had this great idea... How food like this has to be savored.\nSofia: Yes.\nTaco: Gotta sit and enjoy it. Enjoy each other's company. That's what we were doing. In the other room, watching football. Yeah, right. Hey, dig in everyone. All right.\n[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]\nTaco: Mmm.\nSofia: Mm.\nTaco: Let's do it.\nI'm done. Done. Done. Paella time. Beep, beep.\nKevin: Aww! He means, oh, yeah.\n[PEOPLE CHEERING]\nThey're watching the games next door. What game is on now? We're missing everything. Abide by the pause. This is bullshit. Abide by the pause. This is lovely, thank you very much.\nSofia: Thank you. I'm just gonna go to the restroom. Thank you very much. Oh, I'll show you where it is. I know where it is. No, we remodeled. I think I can find it. I insist. How far are you gonna take this? All the way. You wanna hold it? lf I have to. And here comes the soup. Watch out, it's piping hot.\nSofia: Awesome. Can we get one cool for Andre? He actually has really sensitive teeth. Yeah. Really? Absolutely, you do. You deserve that. Yeah, I do. Um, I gotta go make a call. You're not going anywhere. I have to check in with a patient.\nKevin: Let him go. Hey, you guys are unbelievable. But, um... there is another league. What is he saying to his patient? Something like, \"Hey, I heard this is an emergency. It's me, Dr. Andre.\" [IN WHINY VOICE] \"Oh, Dr. Andre, you know those calf implants you gave me? Well, it's making it hard to get... my bedazzled Ed Hardy skinny jeans up over my legs.\" I wanna be with you guys. I wanna be on the party bus. But I can't. Because I already got a party bus. And those guys are great.\nRuxin (in whiny voice): \"Oh, you wearing a stupid hat?\"\n[IN NORMAL VOICE]\n\"You know I am. I'm Dr. Andre.\" Just tell the rest of The Fantasy League of Extraordinary Gentlemen that I'm sorry. And tell Hammer I'll miss him most of all. Hey, you take care of business? Yeah, it's over. Thank you so much for coming to our lunch. Thank you, Taco. I hope you had a great time. Wait, so... Are we finished? Yes.\nPete: Thank you very much, it was excellent.\nKevin: Thank you. Guys, there's some dessert, guys.\nPete: Finally. Jesus.\nJenny: Wait, wait.\nKevin: Hurry up, sit, sit, sit.\nJenny: Stop.\nPete: Go.\nHello, everyone. I'm Terry Bradshaw from Fox Sports Studio.\nThis NFL update: Star running back LaDainian Tomlinson of the San Diego Chargers... will not start today...\nWhat?\n...as the Chargers host the Miami Dolphins.\nAndre: I told you.\nYou lie.\n[ANDRE LAUGHS]\nYou lost, I win. Two weeks in a row.\n[CELL PHONE RINGS]\nTwo for two. Could happen to anyone. Hello?\nBradshaw: Hey, Pete, it's Terry Bradshaw. Hello there. You think I'm gonna let you cheat your friends just so you can win? Man, I was kind of hoping you would.\nAin't gonna happen.\nAnd one other thing, you hear me? What's that? I hated my Uncle Pete, you dickhead. Great. Who was that? That's my new mortal enemy. Andre? Meegan? The dude deep-dicking Meegan? Scintillating dinner conversation? Terry. It looks like you better sell your house, because only winners live here. Slam. Andre, that actually doesn't play. Try something else. I got a slam list. Oh, good, good, yeah. What?\nAndre: Slam list.\nPete: Slam list. In case you have to battle-rap someone? Okay, this is a good one. Um...\n[IN BRITISH ACCENT]\nYou better be careful, my lady... because Jack the Ripper's slicing up losers.\n[IN NORMAL VOICE]\nRight?\nPete: I can't even come back from that. And that's why I write it down. Cale, come here.\n[DOG BARKING]\nCale? Cale's made a doodie. Some Bud Light Lime for Andre. How you doing, baby?\nSofia: Mmm. This whole day has been amazing. Oh, yeah? Lunch turned out so delicious.\nRuxin: Mm-hm. Oh, I had so much fun. Good. And we're gonna have fun. Mm-hm. Oh, really? Well, good.\n[RUXIN CHUCKLES]\nI got the spoons and the cinnamon for the coffee.\nRuxin: All right. He's such a good helper. He is. Looks like you kids got this under control. Hey, can you give my girl a foot rub if she needs one? Foot rubs are my specialty. Thank you, Ruxin. It's the least I could do. You have any peppermint oil? You know I do. All right, I'll take care of your little footsies.\nPete: Oh, he's not getting up. Oh, no. He hurt his ankle. Frank Gore's... Frank Gore's out, man. Who...? Who's got his backup? Glen Coffee? Yeah, who's got Glen Coffee? I don't know who's got Glen Coffee. I would think that it would be... Hey, give me. Ow, ow!\nPete: Don't even.\nRuxin: Refresh! Refresh. Refresh. Oh! Ladies and gentlemen, the newest member of the Double Ent-Andres... Mr. Glen Coffee. That was too fast. No, host gets first dibs. What are you talking about? I'm telling you, since the days of Lombardi. I got him fair and square. You know what I just realized? You were out on the phone earlier. My guess is you got a little tip that Frank Gore had gotten injured. You did not respect the pause. I don't respect the pause? You did not. Do you know what I was doing? What? I was breaking up with my other league.\nKevin: Oh, God Pete: Oh, boy. Excuse me, they knew?\nPete: Sorry. Yes, relax.\nRuxin: Are you joking me? Have you guys been working in collusion? You're all against me. That's why I've never won. Give us a ruling. Who gets Glen Coffee? No way the commissioner can give a fair ruling. Look, Ruxin, I am perfectly capable of giving an impartial ruling, all right? Even though you stole my son's name...\nRuxin: No way. ...and you know you did do it... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Guys, situation developing. Picture-in-picture. Ellie is bringing a special gift to baby Ruxin. And if memory serves, I believe that's a turd.\nRuxin: What is she doing? No.\nPete: She's going, she's on the 15. Don't do it. She's on the 10. She's on the five, she's reaching. Touchdown!\nRuxin: What did she do?\nPete: Six points for Ellie.\nRuxin: What is your filthy daughter doing? All the Purell in the world not gonna fix that. It's just a phase she's going through. A phase? Fun with feces. Fun with feces. You know who has fun with feces? Psychopaths. You saying my daughter's a psychopath? She should be sent abroad. Maybe she could go to Mexico and have a fecal fiesta. Or perhaps Brazil for a caca carnival. What the hell is going on? Did I hear something about a carnival?\nRuxin: Out.\nSofia: Get out. Next weekend, same time, same place? You host a magnificent party, Sofia.\nRuxin: It's not my fault.\nSofia: It's your fault. Over the name Cale? Yeah, it's lost some of its luster. You're right. This league is a lot more fun. Isn't it, though?\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The text is a dialogue between four characters, Ruxin, Kevin, Pete, and Sofia. Ruxin is the host of a fantasy football league, and he is trying to convince Kevin and Pete to join his league. However, Kevin and Pete are reluctant to join because they believe that Ruxin has been unfair to them in the past. Ruxin then tries to convince them that he has not been unfair, and he offers to give them a new player, Glen Coffee, as a reward for joining his league. However, Kevin and Pete are still not convinced, and they suggest that Ruxin has been working with Sofia to steal Glen Coffee from them. Ruxin denies this, and he and Sofia argue about the name of their son, Cale. In the end, Ruxin is angry and tells Kevin and Pete to leave his league.</s>【我为群众办实事】“我为群众办实事”实践活动—— 市妇联开展“把爱带回家”寒假儿童关爱服务活动"

A woman gets out of the car, throws her coffee cup away in a nearby trashcan and looks at the children playing. She then touches her locket, smiles and heads back towards the car. In the car, she tucks a note inside her bag. She backs out of the space and as she puts her car into drive, it explodes)\n[Cut to: Crime scene a few hours later - crawling with FBI agents. Booth and Brennan get out of the car and approach the mini van]\nBOOTH: Look, Bones, all I'm saying is that Caroline went though a lot of trouble to get you private visitation with your father, now you don't want it.\nBRENNAN: The federal detention facility already has visiting areas.\nBOOTH: Yeah, behind 2 inch glass. Now you'll be able to give your old man a hug.(he demonstrates on Brennan)\nBRENNAN: I didn't ask for special treatment, Booth.\nBOOTH: That's because you don't have to because you are special. And you are gonna tell me - whoa - what happened to whatever the hell is melted to that steering wheel and everything else.\nBRENNAN (looking at the remains): Female. Mid 40's to late 50's. Pelvis indicates she's given birth.\nBOOTH: Hey, Bones. Look at that. (points to a finger with a ring on it) Married, right?\nBRENNAN: Wedding ring. Possibility. (to another FBI Agent) Don't just focus on the ground (she points to a leg in a nearby tree then to Booth) Why do you care about my relationship with my father, Booth? You were only too happy to arrest him and put him in prison.\nBOOTH: Alright, look Bones. Ya know what, it's not about being happy, okay. It's about doing my job.\nBRENNAN: Do we know if it was a bomb that caused the explosion?\nBOOTH: Well, let's see. The roof is peeled back and the doors-\nBRENNAN: I was asking him. (she points to another FBI Agent)\nFBI AGENT: We found explosive residue all over the van and metal fragments in the bushes.\nBOOTH: What is that? A Pipe bomb?\nFBI: I can't really be sure until the explosives unit gets the van back to the lab.\nBRENNAN: No, they can't have the van. There are remains seared all over the inside of the vehicle and they can't be compromised.\nFBI AGENT: I have to call-\nBRENNAN: This van will be brought to the Jeffersonian - your bomb techs can look at it there.\nFBI AGENT: I'll....make the call?\nBOOTH: That's - that's alright. You go, go make that call. Bones, come on . You're a little harsh there, maybe you want to talk it out.\nBRENNAN: (pulls a necklace from the car) Look, Booth.\nBOOTH: It's a locket. Ugh, probably her daughter.\nBRENNAN: Who would want to blow up a soccer mom?\nACT I\n(Cut to: Jeffersonian: Forensics area)\nANGELA: Hey, you have a skull for a facial reconstruction?\nZACK: Help yourself.\nANGELA: Oh, great. Is this all I have to work with? I always hated puzzles.\nBRENNAN: Hodgins, before we take that hand from the wheel, you might want to check the fingernails for particulates.\nHODGINS: You know I do.\nANGELA: Oh. My. God.\nZACK: Shouldn't you wait for the bomb tech before you gather the explosive residue?\nHODGINS: Hey, just getting enough to verify his results. Remember, he's a government bureaucrat.\nANGELA: Hey, you're a government bureaucrat, babe.\nHODGINS: In name only. I am a passionate, dedicated scientist who will not be cowed by authoritarian pressure.\nCAM: Stay out of the van until the bomb tech comes, Hodgins.\nHODGINS: But... CAM: Out.\nHODGINS: Fine. I have to check the fingernails anyway.\nCAM (to Angela): How close are we to ID'ing the victim?\nANGELA: Well. This is the skull. I'm good, but I'm not that good.\nBRENNAN: Perhaps you could use these. There's a portion of tongue, hair and brain matter?\nANGELA: Okay. If anybody needs me, I'm gonna go throw up, then do some paper work.\n(As Angela turns to leave, Booth enters with a female agent)\nBOOTH: Okay, this is Special Agent Frost from the bomb unit.\nAGENT FROST: Booth pulled me out of an important lunch. It took me months to set up that meeting. It better be good, Booth.\nBOOTH: She'll be working with you, Hodgins.\nHODGINS (starting at Frost): Yes, please. What? No, no. Um, hmm? Ja..Hodgins. Doc - Doctor. Okay.\nAGENT FROST: I beg your pardon?\nHODGINS: It's Ho-\nANGELA: He's Dr. Jack Hodgins. Angela. Montenegro. I do facial reconstructions - and him.\nAGENT FROST: Please to meet you. (she walks over to where the stuff is ) I'm gonna need you to recover all the metallic particulates then I'm gonna need a chemical tray with-\nFROST & HODGINS: Aqueous buffer solution.\nHODGINS: Yeah. I know.\nHODGINS: You wanna perform capillary electrophoresis?\nFROST: We can do that?\nHODGINS: Oh yeah. (Angela coughs in the background) And it will save time so Angela and I can have dinner. Alone.\nANGELA: Hm (she turns and leaves)\nBOOTH: License plate was destroyed when we traced the VIN number on the van. It was registered to Jeremy Nash in Culpepper, Virginia.\nBRENNAN: He looks familiar.\nBOOTH: Man, our victim was traveling with a lot of stuff - clothes and personal items.\nBRENNAN: Photo album. Most of the pictures were burned, but the man in this photo could be Nash.\nCAM: She packed herself up, keepsakes and all, and took off in the van? Looks like Mrs. Nash was leaving Mr. Nash.\nBOOTH: Ah, god. I hate domestic cases. Alright, so let's got talk to the husband.\nBRENNAN: I can't. I'm seeing my father.\nBOOTH: Now?\nBRENNAN: You and Caroline went to a lot of trouble setting this up. I would hate to appear ungrateful.\nBOOTH: But - (he starts to follow after her, but stops then - to Cam) I'll go talk to, um, the husband by myself.\n(Cut to: Prison - Day. Max is escorted into a private visiting room to meet with Brennan)\nPRISION GUARD: Alright, Max. There ya go.\nMAX: Ooh, gee. Real chairs. It's nice to have an important daughter (he goes to kiss her but she moves away)\nBRENNAN: This is Booth, not me.\nMAX: Well, you thank him for me. I always liked Booth. Nicest guy that ever arrested me.\nBRENNAN: Touching.\nMAX: Well, you must like this. Me in here. I finally have to follow the rules.\nBRENNAN: So that makes me less than you because I think people should follow the rules?\nMAX: You're upset.\nBRENNAN: Yeah, of course I'm upset. My father's a criminal.\nMAX: No, outlaw. There's a difference.\nBRENNAN: Subtle distinctions like that are lost on me and, I imagine, your victims.\nMAX: I know you want some sort of, uh, nice, neat story that puts my life into perspective for you but it doesn't work that way.\nBRENNAN: You could try. Don't I deserve that?\nMAX: I guess I always had a problem with authority. I just always saw myself fighting the system. Kinda like Robin Hood.\nBRENNAN: Do you realize how ridiculous you sound? You're here for murdering the Deputy Director of the FBI.\nMAX: He was a crook. He was a killer and he was going to kill you.\nBRENNAN: And you walked out on Russ and me when I was fifteen!\nMAX: But that was to protect you, people were after us.\nBRENNAN: Because you were a criminal.\nMAX: Outlaw. See, I knew you weren't gonna understand.\nBRENNAN: Ya know what? You're right. This is my fault for expecting we could get past-\nMAX: We can get past this. We can. The court, they're gonna decide how to punish me but now, here - we'll make this whatever we want.\nBRENNAN: (She reaches in her bag and pulls out a deck of cards) Here are the cards you asked for. I gotta go.\nMAX: Wait. These are for us.\nBRENNAN: What?\nMAX: Come on. You remember that game we used to play when you were five years old?\nBRENNAN: Blitz.\nMAX: Blitz. Blitz. Come on. Let's play a couple of hands.\nBRENNAN: You always beat me. I remember that too. A good father would occasionally allow his child to win.\nMAX: I don't believe in encouraging all that, ah, that self esteem crap. You wanna win? Earn it. That's why you're so good at what you do now cause you know that nobody is gonna hand you anything.\nBRENNAN: (sarcastically) So you were a great father.\nMAX: Well, maybe just not as bad as you think. How 'bout this, one hand? Come on.\nBRENNAN: (gets up and heads towards the door) Let me know if you need anything else.\nMAX: Oh, oh, oh. Socks. Socks. You know the, uh, with the arch supports? I gotta stand on that chow line forever.\n(Max watches her as she leaves the room without saying anything)\n(Cut to: Nash Residence. Booth is questioning Jeremy Nash)\nJEREMY NASH: A bomb?\nBOOTH: Yeah, I'm sorry. Were you and your wife having any problems?\nJEREMY NASH: What? What kind of problems?\nBOOTH: Well, she was traveling with a lot of personal stuff: I mean, photo albums and more clothes than she -\nJEREMY NASH: That \"stuff\" was for Celia's new dorm room. She was bringing her clothes, thing to help her decorate - You're FBI for God's sakes. You have no idea who did this? What is this your first case?\nBOOTH: Just relax, okay? I'm just here to help, Mr. Nash, that's all.\nJEREMY NASH: How do I tell Celia? How do I - tell my daughter-\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Room. Focus on a clear box with flesh eating beetles inside.)\nZACK: Dermestes maculates. They clean the bones by eating the charred flesh.\nHODGINS: But they leave behind pieces of shrapnel you might need.\nAGENT FROST: Fascinating and very weird.\nZACK: (with pride) They're mine.\nAGENT FROST: Not a surprise.\n(BRENNAN enters.)\nHODGINS: (to Brennan) Hey! Hi. How as your visit with your-\nBRENNAN: Not germane to the investigation, Hodgins. (While Brennan is talking, Hodgins is looking at Agent Frost) Zack. Her left shoulder was badly shattered but still shows evidence of old trauma. I need the clean bones as soon as they're ready. I also would like you to look at the manubrium. These shadows look like pitting. Have you determined what kind of bomb was used?\nAGENT FROST: I'm still sifting through the debris and waiting for whatever goodies these bugs leave behind.\nBRENNAN: And Dr. Hodgins is just keeping you company?\nHODGINS: What? No. I'm - working. Hard. (Brennan and Zack just look at him) I'm gonna go right now and work. Hard. Some-someplace else. So - (he turns to go - Brennan and Zack still staring at him and Agent Frost looking at the beetles)\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Basement/Storage. Angela is at a computer trying to figure out some symbols for the Widows' Son case.)\nHODGINS: Hey. What are you doing down here?\nANGELA: Oh, analyzing the iconography for the Widow's Son case until somebody needs me for the bomb victim.\nHODGINS: Look, Angie, Um- Agent Frost is a colleague and I am a professional. Okay, so all that stammering and stuff - I mean that's not - that isn't - you know that's involuntary - it's a bodily thing. Yeah. That didn't come out right. Look, I'm not gonna deny that she is attractive -\nANGELA: Oh, totally hot.\nHOGDINS: What?\nANGELA: The bombshell from the Bomb Squad. She's totally hot.\nHODGINS: Yeah, I know. I mean -\nANGELA: Look, Jack. I really don't care what's going on in your pants as long as it stays in your pants.\nHODGINS: You know who's totally hot? You. You are totally -\nANGELA: Okay, save it. What have you got?\nHODGINS: (he hands her some singed pieces of paper found in the van) These were in Any Nash's bag.\nANGELA: There's writing on them.\nHODGINS: Yeah. Yeah, Cam needs you to restore them.\nANGELA: Well, I'll give it a try.\nAGENT FROST: (O.S.) Dr. Hodgins! I need your samples for the spectrometer.\nHODGINS: I - I - I - I have to uh - so I love you and - (he kisses her on the cheek)\nANGELA: Go.\nHODGINS: Okay.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Hallway. Booth & Brennan are walking)\nBOOTH: Nash is gonna pick up his kid, tell her in person. I mean, I don't know how you do that. Tell your kid that your mother just got blown up?\nBRENNAN: I would think a direct approach would be best.\nBOOTH: What? As opposed to what? Sugar coating it? 'Hey, what do you say we go to the park oh and by the way, your mom just got blown up?' How's your dad? You haven't mentioned him.\nBRENNAN: Apparently, his feet hurt.\nBOOTH: You know, I mean his spirits.\nBRENNAN: Well, he's a con man, Booth. He's always cheerful.\nBOOTH: What? That's it?\nBRENNAN: It's not like I ever really had a father. Max was absent for years.\nBOOTH: Well, here's what I know. I know that Nash girl would give anything to spend one more day with her mother. I'm sure you'd feel the same way if something happened to your father.\n(Hodgins approaches them)\nHODGINS: I confirmed triphenylmethane dye and iron sulfate embedded in the manubrium and the flesh. (Booth looks at Hodgins, confused.) Both are found in ball point ink.\nBOOTH: AH! It's a home made tattoo.\nHODGINS: Angela's working on recreating the design.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Angela's Office. The computer is trying to render a design of the tattoo)\nANGELA: This tattoo appears to have been crudely executed.\nBOOTH: Hm, you mean like a prison tat.\nCAM: No record of her being in prison.\nHODGINS: In Russia, prisoners made tattoo ink by burning the heel of a shoe and mixing it with soot and urine.\nBRENNAN: This was a ball point pen, rigged with a sewing needle, pushed down so deep it penetrated her periosteum.\nBOOTH: Ah! You mean - bone.\nCAM: Doesn't seem like a very soccer mom thing to do.\nANGELA: And...here we go. (the computer starts to finish the rendering)\nCAM: An inverted pentagram? Devil worship.\nHODGINS: Mom had a little thing going on the side with Satan? Oh, the burbs.\nANGELA: There is a design in the center that I can't quite get.\nHODGINS: Wait, wait, wait. Is that a fist?\nBRENNAN: A fist?\nBOOTH: A fist.\nANGELA: Yeah. Oh my God. It is a fist.\nHODGINS: So she wasn't Satan's old lady - she was in the NLA.\nANGELA: NLA?\nBOOTH: National Liberation Army.\nHODGINS: Student radicals in the 70's. Thought they could change the world. Set off bombs in army recruiting offices, torched cop cars-\nBOOTH: Yeah, real visionaries. They also shot and killed a cop in '75.\nHODGINS: That was the burglary. They broke into house of a defense contractor to rip off his safe- said it was the people's money. Here. June Harris and her boyfriend, Neil Watkins were charged with the murder, but never found.\nBOOTH: The FBI's been looking for them for 30 years.\nCAM: And there they are.\nANGELA: And our victim? (she does a side by side comparison of June Harris & Amy Nash) It's the same woman.\nBRENNAN: So, our soccer mom - was a killer.\nACT II\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Forensics Platform.)\nCAROLINE: People! Please tell me that all your fancy ass equipment is wrong.\nBOOTH: Oh! (He covers his ears as she sets off the alarm as she enters the platform and a security guy swipes his card.)\nBRENNAN: You're not supposed to be up here.\nCAROLINE: Booth can shoot me later. (she looks at the remains laid out on the table) This can not be June Harris.\nBRENNAN: But the dentals match. Angela's reconstruction matches.\nBOOTH: Amy Nash was June Harris.\nCAROLINE: Por qui moi? She couldn't have waited 4 days to turn herself into a charcoal briquette?\nBRENNAN: I - don't understand.\nBOOTH: Caroline? Why are you here?\nCAROLINE: June Harris was turning herself in. I arranged with her attorney for the surrender. He was gonna deliver her on Thursday after she said goodbye to her family.\nBRENNAN: What was the deal?\nCAROLINE: 9 years.\nBOOTH: 9 years for killing a cop?\nCAROLINE: For turning herself in and laying this all to rest. And since she still maintained her innocence, this was going to be a tough case to prosecute.\nBOOTH: Sam Reilly was the lead on this case for 30 years. He was okay with 9 years?\nCAROLINE: He doesn't know. Part of the deal. He wasn't to be consulted.\nBOOTH: Well, you know what? It's okay to tell him now. I know Sam. He deserves that much after 30 years.\nCAROLINE: Up to you, you're the lead now, Cher. You should bring in Huntzinger. He was her attorney. He might know something.\nHODGINS: Love Huntzinger. Real old time lefty. Worked the Chicago 7 Trial. Sued Nixon, the CIA, Bush -\nBOOTH: That's great, let's get out of here before Hodgins gives him the pinko medal of honor. (to Brennan) Are you coming?\nBRENNAN: I can't. Zack and I have to pull the rest of the shrapnel for the bomb tech and then I have to buy some socks for my dad.\nCAROLINE: Leave her be, Cher. Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\nBOOTH: (turning back to Brennan as Caroline drags him out) Socks?\n(Cut to: FBI - Agent Sam Reilly, Booth & Caroline are coming out of a conference room - and start to walk down the hallway.)\nAGENT SAM REILLY: I have worked this case for 30 years and you don't think I deserve a phone call?\nCAROLINE: It was part of the deal.\nSAM: And you Booth. I trained you. You think this is right? To blow me off like this?\nBOOTH: I just got thrown the case, Sam. Don't go wailing on me.\nSAM: Damn lawyers. Working the case for 30 years and you don't think it deserves a damn phone call. Hey. I'm talking to you. (Booth and Caroline turn around)\nCAROLINE: No. You're yelling at me and my ears are starting to ring. Now I'm sorry after 40 years, as an agent for the FBI, you're still a little girl but I'd like to find out who killed June Harris. So how 'bout you stop whining and help. Okay, Cher?\n(Caroline leaves)\nBOOTH: So. How have ya been , Sam?\nSAM: Shut up, Booth.\n(Cut to: FBI - Observation Room. Sam watches as Caroline & Booth interrogate Leonard Huntzinger)\nCAROLINE: So what's in the bag, Lenny.\nHUNTZINGER: Toothbrush, change of underwear. You guys always find some reason to toss me in the can. No belt. No laces. I'm ready.\nBOOTH: Yeah. Great. Well, we just want to ask you a few questions about June Harris's death.\nHUNTZINGER: I loved June Harris. I loved what she stood for and what she did with her life. Nobody has her balls anymore.\nCAROLINE: Except maybe, Neil Watkins.\nHUNTZINGER: Yeah. You'd love that, wouldn't you. Blame another revolutionary.\nBOOTH: Do you know where Watkins is?\nCAROLINE: They were partners in crime. I don't think he would want to risk June turning him in.\nHUNTZINGER: You ever hear of attorney/client privilege?\nCAROLINE: Ever hear of Obstruction of Justice?\nBOOTH: Ya know, a woman is dead. She's not a martyr to her family, just someone they loved.\nCAROLINE: If you can understand that.\nHUNTZINGER: Cooperating with that system (Sam leaves the observation room) perpetuates that system..\nBOOTH: Yeah, yeah.\nHUNTZINGER: If the system's corrupt-\nBOOTH: Blah, blah, blah. So what's next, Leonard? Are ya gonna warn Watkins that we're on to him?\n(Sam bursts through the door and goes after Huntzinger)\nBOOTH: Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam.\nSAM: You son of a bitch. Watkins are Harris are not heroes. (Booth holds Sam back) You want to know how they changed society? Ask the kid who's father they killed.\nHUNTZINGER: I know that kid. He became a cop just like his father. Very touching.\n(Sam goes to go after Huntzinger again and Huntzinger pushes him back.)\nSAM: You son of a-\nHUNTZINGER: Get out of here.\n(Booth steps in again and holds Huntzinger back.)\nBOOTH: Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.\nCAROLINE: You just hit a Federal Agent, Mr. Huntzinger. Good thing you brought your toothpaste.\nHUNTZINGER: What a surprise. Lock me up to shut me up. You should be talking to that kid, Valenti, instead of busting my ass. The pig comes to me the other day, he wants to know where June is. He said he got a letter from her, as if she's write him or I'd give her up. Hey. (He lifts up his shirt) See these bruises? A gift - from your noble son of a cop.\n(Cut to: Prison - Day. Max is in the visitors room with Brennan.)\nMAX: Nice and soft. I'll be the best dressed on cell block 8. Thanks.\nBRENNAN: Sure.\nMAX: (sighs) Honey. I'm sorry.\nBRENNAN: For what?\nMAX: For- for being such a disappointment as a father. You deserve better. And I should have told you sooner. (Brennan says nothing) Well, that's it? Nothing?\nBRENNAN: Well, what were you expecting? I agree with you.\nMAX: I was expecting some tears or a hug or something. I did apologize. That's what you wanted, isn't it?\nBRENNAN: Well, you didn't mean it?\nMAX: Of course I meant it. Listen. Under any objective standard you have a horrible human being for a father but I'm trying to move on. I got caught so that I could be with you. I was hoping you'd meet me half way.\nBRENNAN: I'm here, aren't I? (after a pause) I - (she reaches into her bag) got you shampoo. Soap isn't good for your hair.\nMAX: Oh, nice. I - I don't want to smell to good, that could be a problem around here.\n(Brennan smiles) There, see. That's better. Thanks.\nBRENNAN: Sure.\nMAX: So the prosecutor's gonna want to talk to you about me. It wouldn't hurt if you, uh, had some good things to say about your old man. Might even offer to testify on my behalf.\nBRENNAN: Is that why you finally apologized?\nMAX: What?\nBRENNAN: To use me? Maybe you'd like me to alter evidence now. That way I could join the family business.\nMAX: How could you think that?\nBRENNAN: I don't know, Max. Maybe because I seem to pass in and out of your life when it's most convenient. Maybe because you built a whole career using your considerable charm to manipulate people?\nMAX: Wait, listen. I know that it's hard to trust me, I know, and it's gonna take some time to fix things, but we can -\nBRENNAN: No. No. Some things break and you can't put them back together again. That's just the way it is. I was find on my own, Max. I was just fine. (she gets up and leaves)\nMAX: Wait, please. (he's left in the room, alone)\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Hodgins work area)\nAGENT FROST: Electrophoresis in HPLC shows potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur in a 75/15/10 ratio.\nHODGINS: Graphite glaze, triple F goex. Supporting grade -\nAGENT FROST: You are a constant surprise.\nHODGINS: Yes. Yes, I am.\nAGENT FROST: I don't know many people who get as excited as I do about the chemical makeup of explosives.\nHODGINS: Well, I - complex molecular structures. Hey, how's it coming - with the-the-the detonator?\nAGENT FROST: Seems to be a wristwatch. Pretty much destroyed in the blast.\nHODGINS: (looking in the microscope) Microscopic glass chips. Probably the crystal. I'll, uh, take a look at the -uh (Frost leans over him and looks in the microscope) composition to see if I can - um - locate a - manufacturer.\nAGENT FROST: Great. So, where do you want me to dump this junk?\nHODGINS: You're tossing the air filter?\nAGENT FROST: I tested it for explosive residue. There wasn't any. It was blown free from the car.\nHODGINS: Yeah. Even better. Do you have any idea what kind of treasures might be trapped in here? Don't touch my things. (to security guard) Watch her.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Zack is showing Cam his findings)\nCAM: She was shot too?\nZACK: The entry presented itself when I was removing shrapnel from the reconstructed shoulder.\nCAM: Are you sure it's not from the bomb or the fire?\nZACK: No. The fragments are lead in a copper alloy coating.\nCAM: Yeah. That's a bullet. I didn't find any dried blood on her clothes. When was she shot?\nZACK: Damage from the blast makes it difficult to tell when the shooting occurred. I'm going to check the remodeling to estimate a time.\nCAM: Hitting the top of the shoulder wouldn't be severe injury.\nZACK: She could bandage herself and still be ambulatory.\nCAM: You know you could say 'walk around' instead. I wouldn't fire you.\nZACK: 'Walk around' implies aimlessness, which I'm not able to determine.\nCAM: Can't believe I still ask these things. Send every thing you got to ballistics at the FBI.\nZACK: I'll inform Dr. Brennan.\n(Cut to FBI: Corridor. Booth, Brennan and Sam are walking)\nSAM: Does not make any sense. The van was rigged blow up, why shoot her?\nBRENNAN: Well, until we see what ballistics determines, it's absurd to speculate.\nSAM: Speculating's kinda what we do here.\nBOOTH: Listen. Danny Valenti is a cop. June Harris murdered his father. He has a gun.\nSAM: He's a good kid, Booth. He didn't do it.\nBOOTH: (Brennan bumps into him, then to Brennan) Out.\nBRENNAN: But that is meaningless speculation.\nSAM: Is she really necessary?\nBOOTH: She's my partner.\nBRENNAN: Mentors often feel threatened when their students surpass them.\nBOOTH: Bones!\nBRENNAN: Well, it's true, Booth. Change can be difficult to accept whether it comes in the form of a revolutionary or the simple passage of time.\nSAM: If she were a guy, I'd deck her.\nBRENNAN: Well, you know, that distinction is no longer necessary, but I wouldn't recommend it. (Booth pushes Brennan into the interrogation room)\nBOOTH: Go, Sam. (Booth pushes Sam into the interrogation room) Thank you.\n(Cut to: FBI - Interrogation Room.)\nBOOTH: Officer Valenti, credit card records show that uh, you bought gas near June Harris's home.\nVALENTI: I didn't know where she lived. Just the town from the post mark on the letter.\nBOOTH: Her apology letter.\nVALENTI: (scoffs) She should have had the nerve to come talk to me, face to face.\nBOOTH: So that's when you went to Huntzinger.\nVALENTI: Yeah.\nBRENNAN: And hit him.\nVALENTI: He protects people like her.\nBRENNAN: That's his job.\nVALENTI: I was five years old when my father was killed. My mother told me he wasn't coming home again, I didn't believe her. I sat by that window waiting, everyday, for months.\nBOOTH: You seem pretty angry about that.\nSAM: Why didn't you tell me what you were gonna do?\nVALENTI: You'd try and talk me out of it.\nBRENNAN: Did you know how little time she was going to serve?\nBOOTH: Because that might make someone take matters into their own hands.\nVALENTI: I'm a cop, man, I didn't blow her up.\nSAM: Booth-\nBOOTH: Sam, it's my investigation. Officer Valenti, I'm gonna need your gun.\nVALENTI: Why?\nBOOTH: Because June Harris was shot before she died.\nBRENNAN: We'd like to make sure the bullet didn't come from your gun.\nVALENTI: You're gonna let them do this to me, Sam?\nSAM: It's just a formality, Danny.\nVALENTI: Then let's be formal. Get a warrant.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nACT III\n(Cut to: FBI - Booth's Office. Sam is alone reading a folder - as Booth & Brennan enter.)\nBOOTH: Sam!\nSAM: Ballistics says that the bullet was NOT a match for Danny's gun.\nBRENNAN: Booth should have that report first. He's the lead.\nSAM: You know, Booth. She must be really good in bed because I can't see any other reason you keep her around here.\nBRENNAN: I am. Very good. But Booth has no direct knowledge of that fact.\nBOOTH: Okay, okay. Let's all stay focused here, people. Okay. Sam, you know what - you should never-\nSAM: But it was a match for the gun that killed Danny's father 30 years ago.\nBOOTH: Right. The same gun that was registered to Harris's old boyfriend, Watkins, but it was never found.\nSAM: Everyone we interviewed at the time said Harris would never make a move without talking to Watkins first. I told you, we need to find him.\nBOOTH: Yeah, okay. We will, Sam. You just gotta give me some room.\n(Booth goes to leave but Sam grabs him arm)\nSAM: Hey, Booth. Don't cut me out. I've worked my whole career for this.\nBOOTH: As soon as I find something out, I'll let you know, Sam. (he places him hand on Sam's arm and then heads out) (to Brennan) Come on, Bones.\n(They leave, leaving Sam alone, once again, in Booth's office)\n(Cut to: Nash Residence. Jeremy Nash is looking at a picture that Booth & Brennan gave to him to look at)\nJEREMY: I remember seeing a picture of him before. I was going through some old photographs, cleaning out a closet. Amy said it was an old boyfriend.\nBOOTH: Hmm. They keep in contact?\nJEREMY: No. I mean, uh, she would have told me. Why? You don't think that - did he kill her?\nBOOTH: How long did you know about your wife's real identity?\nBRENNAN: Yeah, how long?\nJEREMY: I only found out a couple weeks ago.\n(His daughter, Celia, enters the room)\nCELIA: Why didn't you tell me? What? You didn't think I should know about my own mother?\nJEREMY: She didn't want me to tell you. She wanted to do it herself.\nBRENNAN: Your wife never talked about her past?\nCELIA: She used to say only the future was important. All we could do was change the world.\nJEREMY: They didn't agree on how. Celia was, uh, a bit conservative for Amy.\nCELIA: That never mattered. She wasn't some crazy radical to me. She was my mom.\nBOOTH: You must have been relieved she got such a great deal.\nJEREMY: What deal?\nBRENNAN: She didn't tell you?\nJEREMY: She mentioned she was thinking of talking to a Federal Prosecutor - but I talked her out of it.\nBOOTH: Well, you do know it's a felony, aiding and abedding a fugitive.\nJEREMY: You want to charge me? Fine. But saving my family doesn't feel like a crime. Amy was a good mother. A wonderful wife.\nBOOTH: You mind if we take a look around? See if there's any evidence linking your wife to Watkins?\nJEREMY: The house is yours. (to Celia) Come on, sweetie.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab.)\nZACK: The only reason we found any lead or copper in the shoulder was because of the blast. There was advanced bone remodeling.\nCAM: So it's a very old injury.\nZACK: Yes. Bone had completely grown over it.\nCAM: And since it was the same gun that killed the policeman and was never recovered, I think we can assume that June Harris was shot during the robbery.\nZACK: I also found microscopic lead particles on the metacarpals on the left hand with the same degree of remodeling at the shoulder.\nCAM: Another gun shot?\nZACK: No. The same one. The metals are an identical match.\nCAM: So she was shot in the hand and the shoulder with the same bullet? Is that even possible?\nZACK: Angela could give us a scenario that could tell us.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Angela's Office - everyone is standing around the Angelator)\nANGELA: I'm creating a trajectory analysis factoring in both the hand and the shoulder. These are photos from the crime scene, 30 years ago.\nZACK: That's the home of the defense contractor, Gerald Locklear, where the NLA burglary occurred.\nCAM: June Harris and NealWatkins were in Locklear's office at the back of the house.\nANGELA: The original FBI photos were crude. Based on finger prints and scuff marks on the floor. It was assumed that June stood guard while Neal emptied the safe.\nCAM: When officer Valenti walks in, surprising them, June fires - killing Valenti -\nBRENNAN: But that wouldn't explain her injuries, unless - June emptied the safe while Neal stood guard.\nANGELA: Exactly. Neal aims at Office Valenti but June steps between them, raises her hand to stop Neal, but he fires.\nBRENNAN: She was trying to protect the policeman.\nCAM: June Harris was telling the truth. She didn't kill Valenti, Neal Watkins did.\n(Hodgins enters)\nHODGINS: He also made the bomb. The watch used to make the timer? Was coated with a volatilized pigment used by the Sawyer Time Company.\n(They all head over to the computer. Hodgins pulls up a picture of a watch)\nBRENNAN: An American flag watch.\nCAM: Nice ironic touch.\nHODGINS: Watkins always used the same type of watch when making bombs for the NLA. It was a signature. They found traces of them a ROTC headquarters, the IRS office-\nCAM: June told him she was going to turn herself in.\nHODGINS: He wasn't gonna let that happen. So he made a new bomb using an old watch and killed her. And he left a message for anyone who thought the revolution was over.\nANGELA: Sounds like a bad ex-boyfriend.\nBRENNAN: That's assuming she was in contact with him.\nCAM: And we have no way of knowing where that would have taken place if she had seen him.\nHODGINS: Not so sure about that. I have her air filter. It's like an entomological GPS.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Cat walk. Booth is looking out over the balcony. Brennan approaches him, carrying a cup of coffee)\nBOOTH: What's taking Hodgins so long?\nBRENNAN: It's an exacting process.\n(She hands him the cup of coffee)\nBOOTH: (takes it) Ah, thank you. So um, how did your dad like his socks?\nBRENNAN: Fine.\nBOOTH: That's sorta a way to start a conversation there, Bones.\nBRENNAN: I know.\nBOOTH: Ya know, look. I'm - I should never have gotten in the middle of all this, I'm - I'm sorry. I was just - I'm just trying to help.\nBRENNAN: He wanted me to testify on his behalf. He just wants to use me.\nBOOTH: Well, he's s con man, Bones, that doesn't mean that he doesn't love you. He's just looking for a little payback.\nBRENNAN: Payback?\nBOOTH: Yeah. He's thinking that he got arrested so that he could spend some more time with you. I mean, you could at least return the favor by doing something nice for him.\nBRENNAN: I'm not sure I want a father who's always keeping score.\nBOOTH: Yeah. Sounds like you are too.\nBRENNAN: You know what? You're right. This is none of your business.\nBOOTH: You know what, Bones? You're never gonna forgive yourself if you don't cut the guy some slack just because you're afraid to get hurt.\nBRENNAN: Ugh, what the hell is taking Hodgins so long?\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Hodgins desk. He's looking through a microscope when Angela approaches)\nANGELA: Where's the bombshell from the bomb squad?\nHODGINS: She went back to the FBI to catalog evidence. Thank god. She was driving me crazy. It was just science all the time. Then, she tries to destroy perfectly good evidence-\nANGELA: What about the breasts?\nHODGINS: I started thinking about them dragging on the floor when she's 70. (Angela leans over and kisses him) How are you doing?\nANGELA: Well, that burned paper? Is a letter that she wrote. So I'm using the spectral comparator to locate the ink particles.\nHODGINS: Cool...\nANGELA: The, uh, computer is rendering the content now, so. You?\nHODGINS: I found pollen.\nANGELA: oh.\nHODGINS: Most of it Pinus Appalachiana. Shenandoah (he has a realization about something) Pine - which is only found on Shenandoah Mountain in West Virginia. There was also crushed Pendleton Leather Flower in the tire treads which is only found here in the Shale Barrens along the upper Potamic - it is very secluded between the towns of Hendersonville and Maple Flats. Booth! (he calls up to Booth, still up on the catwalk with Brennan) I know where you can find Watkins! (They start to head down.)\nANGELA: That's nice work, Hodgins. You know, my computer, is gonna be rendering for a while. Wanna go to the Medieval storage room?\n(He reaches down and pushes the head covering for a suit of armor out from under his desk with his foot)\nANGELA: Oh.\nHODGINS: Booth! What the hell is taking you so long. (Angela kisses him again)\n(Cut to: Booth's car.)\nBRENNAN: You told Reilly where Watkins is?\nBOOTH: Yeah, he's meeting us there.\nBRENNAN: He's too emotional.\nBOOTH: This is his case. He's invested.\nBRENNAN: He's irrational. Probably male menopause.\nBOOTH: What? He's a good man and you know what? There's no such thing. That is a sexist myth.\nBRENNAN: Factually, hormone production drops in your 50's. Sexual desire decreases. You have to deal with the reduction of muscle mass, erectile dysfunction-\nBOOTH: Hey, alright, hey. Let's just keep the conversation up, shall we?\nBRENNAN: And, there's evidence that certain men become very unstable.\nBOOTH: Do you want me to start talking about your father again?\nBRENNAN: You're very testy.\nBOOTH: And 35. I'm only 35.\nBRENNAN: Okay, okay.\nBOOTH: They have blue pills for that.\n(Cut to: Watkin's Residence. Booth & Brennan get out of the car and walk towards the house.)\nBOOTH: No. I don't like this, it's too quiet.\nBRENNAN: Wasn't Reilly suppose to meet us?\nBOOTH: Yeah.\n(They go around the side of the house, trying to get a look inside. Brennan takes out her gun)\nBOOTH: Gee, why didn't you bring the big one?\n(They enter the house and walk through the rooms, still not seeing anyone. Suddenly, Brennan sees something in the other room.)\nBOOTH: Okay. (he pushes her shoulder back, wanting her to stay behind him) Bones.\n(They walk into the room and find Neal Watkins dead and Sam Reilly standing over him, holding a gun)\nBOOTH: Easy, Sam. Put the gun down, step away from the body.\nSAM: Booth, look at him. He did it to himself. I didn't do this, Booth.\n(Sam places his gun on the arm of the couch)\nACT VI\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Autopsy Bay.)\nCAM: .38 caliber slug - matches the revolver found at the scene. Now positioning is consistent with a self inflicted gun shot wound but could easily have been staged.\n(Brennan and Zack are looking at x-rays on a screen)\nBRENNAN: Zack, bring up that hand x-ray. (it appears on the screen) Look at this.\nZACK: Asymmetric narrowing on the first metacarpal phalangeal joints.\nBRENNAN: Ulna deviation, barely discernible.\nZACK: Would you like my finger Dr. Brennan?\nBRENNAN: Please.\nCAM: What are you two thinking?\nBRENNAN: Neal Watkins had rheumatoid Arthritis in his hands. (she wraps Zack's finger with an ace bandage) This would approximate the strength of his arthritic finger. Pull. (she grabs Zack's finger and he tries to pull it away.) Harder.\nZACK: I'm trying, Dr. Brennan.\nBRENNAN: Watkins fine motor function would be no greater than Zack's gauzed wrapped finger.\nCAM: Neal Watkins wasn't able to pull the trigger.\nBRENNAN: He couldn't have shot himself.\nZACK: If he couldn't pull the trigger, he wouldn't have the manual dexterity to assemble the bomb either.\nCAM: There's one man who knew exactly how Neal made his bombs.\nBRENNAN: The same man who worked the case for 30 years. I'll call Booth.\n(Cut to: FBI - Interrogation Room. Sam is pacing. Booth & Caroline enter.)\nBOOTH: Hi Sam. Dr. Brennan determined that it wasn't a suicide.\nSAM: What?\nCAROLINE: The gun was a plant. Wouldn't be the fist time - an Agent planted a gun, would it?\nBOOTH: Well, Forensics searched the house and, uh, they determined that there wasn't enough evidence to suggest that Watkins made the bomb that killed Harris.\nSAM: What about the watch?\nBOOTH: That's the thing, Sam. It turns out that two Sawyer Company American Flag watches were confiscated in '74 in LA raid.\nCAROLINE: We checked the evidence locker. A lot of things were missing - including a watch.\nSAM: It was a dog case, Booth. That crap was moved off site years ago. You know what happens during a move.\nCAROLINE: So, you had a 30 year obsession but you didn't keep track of your evidence. You have a good service record, cher. We can make a deal.\nSAM: Look. I know you have to do this dance, but there is a real killer out there.\nBOOTH: Look, I understand, Sam. I do. I think - you should find yourself a lawyer.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Hodgins approaches the platform)\nHODGINS: I was cataloging the watch debris and noticed that the oxidation and bacterial erosion of the metal was inconsistent with watches that would have been stored in evidence for 30 years.\nCAM: But weren't the watches discontinued after '76?\nHODGINS: Yes, but I found a few available on line for collectors - still sealed.\nBRENNAN: You traced one to a buyer?\nHODGINS: Didn't have to. Since the watch was 30 years old, the bomber had to put in a new battery - he left behind a thumb print. The casing protected it during the blast. I asked the bureau to run the print.\n(Angela enters)\nANGELA: The letter has finished rendering. It's not addressed to Watkins.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Angela's office. Brennan picks up a copy of the rendered letter)\nBRENNAN: (V.O) Dear Celia. I've done terrible things in my life, things I can't change. I know how much pain this will cause you, but never forget how much I love you. I know we didn't always agree on how, but we both hope for the same thing, a just world.\n(Cut to: Nash residence. Jeremy & Celia Nash heading out of their house as Booth & Brennan are walking up the walkway towards them.)\nBRENNAN: (to Booth) Funerals today?\nBOOTH: Yeah.\nBRENNAN: They seem like every other, normal, grieving family.\nBOOTH: That's what everyone seems, is it.\nBOOTH: Mr. Nash? You're under arrest for the murder of June Harris, AKA Amy Nash.\nCELIA: Oh, that's crazy.\nBOOTH: I'm sorry, Celia. (Brennan hands her the letter) We know about the watch.\n(Celia reads the letter while Brennan's V.O. continues)\nBRENNAN: (V.O.) Even thought I didn't fire the gun that took that man's life, I have to take responsibility for it and for my cowardice, hiding all these years.)\nJEREMY: I caught her sneaking out one night. She had been seeing him. She betrayed me, Celia. She betrayed us.\nCELIA: How could you do this?\nJEREMY: 25 years I believed she loved us but she used us to keep her cover-\nBOOTH: Let's go.\n(As Booth walks Nash to the car, Brennan stays behind with Celia - V.O. Continues)\nBRENNAN: (V.O.) - I tried to spare you and your father pain. I know what your father thought when he caught me going to see Neal, but I would rather die than betray your father.\nCELIA: (to Jeremy) She was trying to get him to surrender too! (Jeremy turns back to her) She was trying to do the right thing, daddy.\nBOOTH: Let's go. You got the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you-\n(Celia continues reading the letter while Brennan comforts her)\nBRENNAN: (V.O.) If I've learned anything, it's that we can never let the chaos and injustice make us so blind with anger that we become part of the problem. Understanding, compassion, kindness and the only true revolutionary ideas. When we compromise those, we become what we despise and we lose our humanity. The world might see my legacy of one of violence and destruction, but I know that you are my real legacy and for that - I will be thankful everyday.\n(Cut to: Prison. Visitation Room.)\nMAX: Hi! I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again.\nBRENNAN: I thought maybe we could see if we remember that card game?\nMAX: Yeah, sure. (He pulls out a deck of cards from his pocket)\n(Cut to: FBI - Booth's office. Sam enters.)\nSAM: You know, I've kept this bottle of single malt on my desk since '75. I always said when we put this case to bed, I'd open it. I'd like you to help me with that, Booth.\nBOOTH: Listen, Sam. I - I want to apologize.\nSAM: Hey. I would have done the same thing myself (he pours Booth some Scotch.) Well, maybe not quite the same thing. I would have slapped me around a little bit. (Booth laughs.) To the changing of the guard. (they clink glasses and drink)\n(Cut to: Prison. Visitation Room. Brennan and her dad are playing cards.)\n(Cut to: Lincoln Memorial. It's night and Booth and Brennan are on the steps, talking. Booth is playing with the lid on his cup of coffee.)\nBRENNAN: How much scotch did you drink?\nBOOTH: Oh, just enough. You know, I would have invited you, but Reilly. He just - wow - he doesn't like you.\nBRENNAN: I understand.\nBOOTH: I'm sorry. Was that rude?\nBRENNAN: Not from someone who's been drinking.\nBOOTH: God, you know, I love this place. I love it. I love this country. You know, I tell ya something. If I was working law enforcement back in the day when they threw all that tea, alright, in the harbor - I'm good, alright, I'm - I'm good. I would have rounded everybody up and we'd still be English.\nBRENNAN: Ya think?\nBOOTH: Yup. Yup. Definitely. (he signs and takes a sip of coffee)\nBRENNAN: I saw my father.\nBOOTH: Wow. I didn't think that you were gonna - do that.\nBRENNAN: As an Anthropologist, I accept change as the natural order of things - but with him I didn't allow for transformation. Ya know, I predicated his behavior based on a set of outmoded preconceptions. It wasn't rational.\nBOOTH: Wow. I - I didn't get any of that.\nBRENNAN: If I was conducting an objective experiment on my father, observing his behavior, I'd have to conclude that he loves me.\nBOOTH: Hmm. Why? What happened?\nBRENNAN: We played cards.\nBOOTH: Cool.\nBRENNAN: I killed him.\nBOOTH: Good for you.\n(He leans up against Brennan's shoulder and it fades out with the two of them looking out at the Washington Monument)\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Don't you trust me?\nMel: I don't know. What with the dragon and all that.\nAce: The dragon. It's just something to frighten little children with. It's like witches and goblins. There ain't no such thing.\nAce: Wicked!\nMel: Get down!\nAce: That's not a real dragon. That was a laser beam.\nMel: Look out!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIce cliff\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGlitz: It's no use, Doctor. I've located the Ice Garden but there's a distinct absence of dragon or treasure.\nThe Doctor: Glitz, I sympathise with your disappointment, but I'm about to plummet to my death.\nGlitz: Oh, I suppose you want me to risk my neck and come and help you.\nThe Doctor: Glitz!\nGlitz: All right, all right. Don't get your delicates in a twist.\nThe Doctor: Glitz!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRefrigeration room\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKane: Belazs, you astound me. Those two girls should have been searched when they were arrested. You seem to be taking advantage of my former feelings for you. Be warned, the past is an empty slate. I demand absolute loyalty now and forever, and I don't forgive those who betray me. The girls must be stopped before they reach Glitz and the Doctor. They must be eradicated.\nKane: What could be more appropriate than to despatch some of Glitz's former crew after the girls. He betrayed his crew, now they can have their revenge. Everyone should be allowed his moment of revenge.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBase of the Ice cliff\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe Doctor: I say, thank you.\nGlitz: It's no use, Doctor. Even if we did find the treasure, it'd take us longer than seventy two hours, and Belazs said if I didn't return Kane's money within seventy two hours they'd confiscate my spacecraft.\nThe Doctor: Why don't you explain the problem to him?\nGlitz: Oh, he'd slice his own mother up to make a point. If he was a mortician, the corpses would keep their eyes open.\nThe Doctor: Ah.\nGlitz: In fact, if Kane knew we were after the...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRefrigeration room\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGlitz (O.C.): Dragon's treasure, your life expectancy wouldn't be looking too clever at the moment. He's a cold man, Doctor. Cut him open and you won't find a heart, just a lump of ice.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBase of the Ice cliff\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe Doctor: These types never have any sense of fair play.\nGlitz: Exactly. Which is why I've come to the conclusion that play it by the rules is a mug's game. I have decided to hijack the Nosferatu. Which is where you come in, Doctor.\nThe Doctor: Ah, hang on there a minute, Glitz. I'm engaged in a project of scientific curiosity. I mean, that dragon, or whatever it may turn out to be, could be an undiscovered species.\nGlitz: Look, I'll do you a good deal. You help me get the Nosferatu back, and I'll give you the treasure map so's you and Mel can go looking for this dragon. I can't say fairer than that, can I?\nThe Doctor: You have me there, Glitz. Without the map, I'll never find the creature.\nGlitz: You're a man of insight and logic, Doctor.\nThe Doctor: All right, then. Where's the Nosferatu berthed?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRefrigeration room\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGlitz (O.C.): In the lower docking bay.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRestricted zone\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKane: A work of artistry, my friend. Incandescent artistry. I could almost believe Xana lives again. A unique beauty, yes, but more than that, a criminal genius also. Oh, what a waste. It should have been I who was killed escaping arrest, not you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTop of the Ice cliff\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAce: You're joking. I'm not going down there.\nMel: Look, there's the Doctor's brolly. We must be on the right track.\nAce: What did he have to come this way for? I could break my neck.\nMel: How are we going to get down there?\nAce: Hang on.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLower docking bay\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGlitz: There's only one guard. Do you think you can occupy him while I slip on board?\nThe Doctor: I'll do my best.\nGlitz: Go on, then. Away you go.\nThe Doctor: Excuse me. What's your attitude towards the nature of existence? For example, do you hold any strong theological opinions?\nGuard: I think you'll find most educated people regard mythical convictions as fundamentally animistic.\nThe Doctor: I see. That's a very interesting concept.\nGuard: Personally, I find most experiences border on the existential.\nThe Doctor: Well, how do you reconcile that with the empirical critical belief that experience is at the root of all phenomena?\nGuard: I think you'll find that a concept can be philosophically valid even if theologically meaningless.\nThe Doctor: So, what you're saying is that before Plato existed, someone had to have the idea of Plato.\nGuard: Oh, you've no idea what a relief it is for me to have such a stimulating philosophical discussion. There are so few intellectuals about these days. Tell me, what do you think of the assertion that the semiotic thickness of a performed text varies according to the redundancy of auxiliary performance codes?\nThe Doctor: Yes.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNosferatu\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGlitz: Ah, my ship. Soon be light years away from this place.\nBelazs: I wouldn't touch those controls if I were you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBase of the Ice cliff\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAce: Wicked.

You said if I could get hold of the grotzits I could have the Nosferatu back.\nBelazs: Then I shall just have to make sure you don't manage to find the money in time. I shall have to make very sure.\nThe Doctor: Hello. Not interrupting anything, am I?\nBelazs: What are you doing here?\nThe Doctor: That's a very difficult question. Why is everyone round here so preoccupied with metaphysics?\nGlitz: I think she's going to kill us, Doctor.\nThe Doctor: Ah. An existentialist.\nBelazs: Quiet! Only one of us can leave Iceworld aboard the Nosferatu, and one way or the other it's going to be me.\nGlitz: What about the boss, Mister Kane? Does he know of your little enterprise?\nBelazs: Kane doesn't own me.\nThe Doctor: Oh, I think he does. I think he bought you like he buys everything in Iceworld.\nBelazs: What would you know about it?\nThe Doctor: I think he bought you a long time ago. He paid seventeen crowns for each of Glitz's crew. How much did he pay for you? Was it worth it? Were you worth it?\nBelazs: That's what I sold myself for, Kane's mark. I ought to cut my hand off for doing it.\nBelazs: Go on, then. Kill me!\nGlitz: Well, come on, Doctor. We've got the Nosferatu back. Let's get out of here.\nThe Doctor: No, Glitz. You can't go on stealing everything you want, like this Stradivarius and that Dutch master. Pay Kane back his debt, even if it costs a thousand crowns, ten thousand crowns. Pay back the debt. And as for you, your debt to Kane, I don't think you'll be able to pay it off. Ever.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRestricted zone\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKane: The whole of eternity has held its breath for this moment. But no one must ever see your work. It exists, that is enough. No one can ever look upon your work and live.

Did you hear that?\nMel: Hear what?\nAce: I thought I heard something.\nMel: Well, what kind of something?\nAce: I don't know. Can you see anything?\nMel: Look out!\nAce: Run!\nThe Doctor: I think we go straight on. Either that, or we don't.\nGlitz: Well, now that we've found the Dragonfire, what's next on your list of tourist attractions, Doctor?\nThe Doctor: Well, I'm not absolutely certain this one's over yet.\nThe Doctor: It must be generating a spot temperature in excess of fifteen hundred Celsius.\nMel: Right, cover your ears.\nAce: Ace! Yeah, good job. Throw the other one.\nAce: Yeah, go for it, tiger. That was well brill.\nMel: We're not in the clear yet.\nAce: I don't believe it. Not after two cans of Nitro. Nothing can survive that. Come on, Mel, shift!\nMel: Okay!\nAce: Come on! Come on, wake up.\nMel: Oh, what happened?\nAce: It's all right, doughnut. He's gone.\nGlitz: Get back, Doctor.\nThe Doctor: No, Glitz, don't.\nGlitz: Why?\nThe Doctor: We've got no right to kill.\nGlitz: Why didn't it kill us?\nThe Doctor: Perhaps we'd better ask it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRefrigeration room\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKracauer: Can't sleep, Belazs?\nBelazs: How old do you think I am, Kracauer?\nKracauer: Thirty three, thirty four?\nBelazs: And how old do you think I was when I first agreed to join Kane? Sixteen. That was a long time ago. Do you see this?\nKracauer: Yes, the mark of the sovereign.\nBelazs: You'd have thought it would begin to disappear after twenty years.\nKracauer: We sold ourselves. We knew what we were doing. We had a choice.\nBelazs: I was sixteen.\nKracauer: Even at sixteen we had a choice.\nBelazs: He'll kill us. He'll find someone younger and he'll kill us unless we kill him first.\nKracauer: How do you propose to do that?\nBelazs: With heat. Even here in Iceworld it's too warm for him. I've seen inside the restricted zone. That's where he keeps his refrigeration unit. He has to return there whenever his body temperature rises too high.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLower levels\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAce: Do you want some coffee?\nMel: Oh, thanks.\nAce: Do you know what I did for a job when they threw me out of school?\nMel: No.\nAce: I worked as a waitress in a fast food cafe. Day in, day out, same boring routine. Some boring life. It was all wrong. It didn't feel like me that was doing it at all. I felt like I'd fallen from another planet and landed in this strange girl's body, but it wasn't me at all. I was meant to be somewhere else. Each night I'd walk home and I'd look up at the stars through the gaps in the clouds, and I tried to imagine where I really came from. I dreamed that one day everything would come right. I'd be carried off back home, back to my real mum and dad. Then it actually happened and I ended up here. Ended up working as a waitress again, only this time I couldn't dream about going nowhere else. There wasn't nowhere else to go.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRestricted zone\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKane: One day, when we return home, I shall erect colossal statues in your honour.\nComputer: Current ambient temperature minus ten Celsius.

My real mum and dad would never have given me a naff name like Dorothy. Come on.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRestricted zone\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nComputer: Minus one hundred and fifty. Minus one hundred and sixty.

Bilge bag.\nGlitz: What's that?\nThe Doctor: Now, now, stop this squabbling. There's no place for animosity on a serious scientific undertaking.\nMel: Do you mean the dragon?\nThe Doctor: Well, it's not so much a dragon as more of a semi-organic vertebrate with a highly developed cerebral cortex.\nAce: And it's got laser beams in its eyes. It tried to kill us.\nMel: Yes.\nThe Doctor: Really? Well, I wonder what you did to annoy it?\nAce: It just came at us, Professor. No warning.\nThe Doctor: Really. Well, let's see what this vertebrate with laser beams has got to say for itself.\nThe Doctor: Hello. Where might you have popped up from, then?\nMel: He's been sent by Kane, Doctor.\nAce: He's got masses of them frozen in his deep freeze.\nThe Doctor: Cryogenesis, eh?\nGlitz: Hang about. I'd recognise that mutinous expression anywhere.\nAce: Friend of yours, is he?\nGlitz: Pudovkin, old son, you've no idea how pleased I am to see you again.\nThe Doctor: It's no good, Glitz. Ace says he's been cryogenically frozen.\nGlitz: What about the time we captured that space freighter loaded up with all that natural fruit alcohol. We got well dehydrated that night, didn't we?\nThe Doctor: It's no use. Deep cryogenics freezes the neural pathways.\nGlitz: Oh, come on, old son. A joke's a joke. It's me, Sabalom Glitz.\nThe Doctor: It's completely impossible for him to recall any events prior to cryogenesis.\nPudovkin: I remember.\nThe Doctor: Except in cases of overwhelming hatred or anger.\nPudovkin: I remember how you always had the best of our pickings.\nGlitz: I don't recall.\nPudovkin: I remember. I remember how you sold our entire crew to Kane to be frozen as mercenaries.\nGlitz: Oh now, come on, old son, don't go jumping to conclusions.\nAce: I thought he was a friend of yours.\nGlitz: More of an acquaintance, actually.\nThe Doctor: We don't mean you any harm.

You may leave me.\nBelazs: Leave?\nKane: Whenever you wish. Go in fortune and happiness.\nKane: You traitor. I've been planning my revenge for three thousand years. How can you stand in my way now I am so close?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSinging Trees\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nArchivist: Kane's partner, the woman Xana, killed herself during the final siege of the gang's headquarters to avoid being arrested and tried for her crimes.\nThe Doctor: Fascinating.\nMel: Well, that explains about Kane, but where does the creature come from?\nGlitz: And what about the fabulous treasure? Is this it?\nThe Doctor: Oh, no, no. We might be deep beneath Iceworld, but Kane could find his way here easily enough. No, the treasure's got to be somewhere else, somewhere beyond Kane's reach. What does he fear most?\nAce: Heat. It'll kill him.\nThe Doctor: Precisely. And what better way of protecting the real treasure than to leave a fire-breathing dragon to guard it? What better protection than if the dragon is the treasure.\nMel: The creature, the treasure?\nThe Doctor: Am I right? Are you the one that everyone's looking for, treasure?\nGlitz: It must be worth a fortune.\nThe Doctor: No, look past the gold and the gemstone, Glitz. Look at the fire inside.

Let's go upstairs.\nJoey: (smiles) Okay.\n(She starts climbing the ladder and Dawson stares up after her smiling. Cut to Joey climbing through his window and Dawson following, kissing and giggling the whole way, oblivious to Jen sitting on the bed. Dawson starts kissing Joey's neck and she notices her.)\nDawson: Jen?\nJoey: What's wrong?\nJen: (mumbling..almost deliriously) Abby...and I were on the dock and ....and we were up there ...and we...we were drinking ...and she ...fell back and hit her head ...and she ...she drowned. (pauses) Abby's dead.\n(Joey is shocked, as well as Dawson, and she goes and sits next to Jen on the bed and puts her arm around her as Jen starts crying.)\n(OPENING CREDITS)\n(Cut to Joey looking through an old photo album of pictures of her with her mother. She has a tear rolling down her face. Her dad walks out.)\nMr.Potter: (looking at the pictures) Seems like a lifetime ago. Your mother loved that dress. I told her to take it back, too expensive. She went out and bought two of em just like it just despite me.\n(Joey cracks a small smile.)\nMr.Potter: That was your mother. Why are you looking at this?\nJoey: This girl at my school died on Saturday night. She drowned.\nMr.Potter: Joey, that's terrible. Were you two close?\nJoey: No, not particularly. She was sort of a nightmare. But it's, uh, sort of got me thinking...remembering.\nMr.Potter: Joey, we, uh, never really talked about your mother or her death...\nJoey: (obviously avoiding) Well, uh, it's getting late and I have to be getting to school so...\n(She gets up and takes her cup back into the kitchen and grabs her bag. Cut to Capeside High. Jen's walking through the hallway to her locker and everybody's staring at her. Cut to a group of kids sitting in a circle around a counselor. Pacey, Andie, Jack, and Jen are included.)\nCounselor: Hi, my name is Elizabeth, and I'm a grief counselor. I'm here to facilitate a discussion about Abby. I know you've all be dealt a heavy blow, but by sharing your feelings with each other, it could aid in the long, and difficult, process we call grieving.\n(Pacey's biting his nails, obviously unconcerned about the whole thing as Andie stares around the room and Jack just looks bored.)\nGirl: I'd like to make an announcement. The Girls' Service League is distributing yellow arm bands that we're wearing in Abby's memory. If anyone would like an arm band, please meet me in the cafeteria at lunchtime.\n(Jen just laughs unbelievably at the concern. Jack scratches his nose.)\nCounselor: Jennifer. I was told that you were a close friend of Abigail's. Would you like to talk about some of the feelings your experiencing?\nJen: No.\nCounselor: That's perfectly okay. I understand. Andie? Did you know Abigail?\nAndie: Yeah, I did.\nCounselor: Can you talk about your feelings?\nAndie: Well, um...I guess I'm feeling shocked. I mean she was so incredibly alive and she had such a great spirit. It's-it's really a tragedy.\n(Jen is disgusted by these fake feelings of concern so she grabs her things and storms out.)\nCounselor: Jennifer?\n(Cut to the cafeteria. Dawson is watching the girl hand out the yellow arm bands.)\nGirl: Thank you so much for honoring Abby's memory.\n(Joey comes over.)\nJoey: Hey.\nDawson: (smiles) Hey.\nJoey: Listen, I know we have a lot to talk about concerning the other night but..\nDawson: Listen, Joey, could we just not ...go there...right now? Because I mean there's ...a lot going on and we can analyze this to death later just...\nJoey: Right. (Joey kind of looks around and scoots in closer.) Dawson, the truth is, I never really liked Abby.\nDawson: Ditto.\nJoey: I actually despised her.\nDawson: It's weird. I mean, Abby was weird, that she died was weird, the way she died was weird. I can't even imagine what the funeral's going to be like.\nJoey: I'm not going.\nDawson: You're not?\nJoey: The last funeral I went to was my mom's. I mean, I haven't even gone to her gravesite. I think going to Abby's funeral would just open this Pandora's Box of emotions that, frankly, I'd rather keep sealed tight.\nDawson: (tentatively) Joey...your mother died three years ago. If you have these feelings you haven't dealt with, how long were you planning on waiting?\nJoey: I don't know. I guess I'm just...there's a part of me that's still holding on. That little girl inside is just waiting for her return. You know, that her death was just some cosmic error and eventually, God will realize he made a terrible mistake and he'll send her back to me like he did my dad. And ...(smiles) I'll have my mom again. (looks at Dawson) I know it sounds ridiculous.\nDawson: No, no, it's-no. But, I mean, that's a child's false hope. Eventually, you're going to have to let it go.\nJoey: Yeah, but I don't want to let it go. (pauses) You don't know what it's like, Dawson.\n(Cut to Jen, in the bathroom, splashing water on her makeup-stained face. Andie enters.)\nAndie: Um, Jen? I've been looking all over for you. You just stormed out of class. Are you okay?\nJen: If dealing with Abby's death isn't hard enough, but to watch everybody parade around like Abby was their best friend, it's sickening. Aside from me, Abby didn't have a single friend in Capeside.\nAndie: That's because she was a--(stops herself)\nJen: A bitch! Come on, Andie, say it! Abby was a bitch.\nAndie: Well, I wouldn't go that far...\nJen: Yeah, well, you would've three days ago, but now that she's dead you wax poetic about her great spirit. It's so insincere!\nAndie: Well, I don't think it's appropriate to maline her character after she's gone!\nJen: It isn't malining if it's true! Believe me, it would have been easier for everybody if Abby had just been this wonderful person with this virtuous qualities but she wasn't! She was mean! And the least we can do is acknowledge who she really was.\n(Jen exits out the bathroom, Andie follows.)\nAndie: Jen, listen, I know this must be hard for you.\nJen: And I am so sick and tired of people treating me like I'm some kind of celebrity just because I happened to be at the scene of the crime. It's funny. Abby spent her entire life shattering our fragile egos and that's why people disliked her so intensely. Leave it to Abby. Even in her death she's still exposing hypocrisy.\nAndie: Well, I feel bad but I always tried to reach out to her and everytime she rejected me.\nJen: She rejected you?! If you hadn't rejected her at the wedding, none of this ever would have happened!\nAndie: What?\nJen: You kicked us out of the wedding, Andie. That's why we were at the docks in the first place.\nAndie: (slowly) Don't say that.\nJen: I'm sorry, okay? I can't--I've got to go home.\n(She leaves down the hall. Cut to Dawson coming in his front door, he spots his mom coming down the stairs.)\nDawson: Hey!\nGail: Hi honey! So...how was school?\nDawson: Weird. Everybody's playing the beautiful mourners but underneath there's this weird sense they're all munchkins finally freed from the spell of the wicked witch of the east. (Kristin's note: Wasn't it the wicked witch of the west?)\nGail: Well, honey, I know you're dealing with a lot right now, but I have some news I need to share with you.\nDawson: You sound serious.\nGail: No, no, no, it's not bad news. It's good news. Remember the piece I did on the teenage girls?\nDawson: Yeah.\nGail: Well, I won the Peil Vision Award for Excellence for News Broadcasting.\n(Dawson hugs her.)\nDawson: That's incredible, Mom! Congratulations!\nGail: Oh, but that's not the news. The news is that because of the award, I've been offered a job as network correspondent. It's a lot of money, it's high profile, it's...in Philadelphia.\n(Dawson's face drops.)\nDawson: Oh. Are you going to take it?\nGail: Well, professionally, it's a huge leap for me. It's what I've always worked for.\nDawson: But I don't want to move to Philadelphia...\nGail: Oh, I completely understand that. You're halfway through high school. No, I do not want to uproot you. If I took the job, I assume your father would move back in and I would come home as often as I could...\nDawson: S-So what about you and Dad? Are you guys just throwing in the towel?\nGail: Well, that's the last thing I want, but I'm hitting my head up against the wall here, honey. Your father doesn't seem to have any interest in making things work. So if I walk away from this career opportunity, and I lose this marriage, what do I have?\nDawson: You still have me.\n(She smiles. Cut to Grams walking in to Jen's room where Jen's lying on her bed wrapped in a blanket.)\nGrams: Jennifer, I'm worried about you.\nJen: Don't be. I'm just tired.\nGrams: You know, I can't say I was particularly fond of your friend, Abby. I always had the distinct impression that she was mocking me.\n(Jen smiles.)\nGrams: She was, wasn't she?\nJen: Don't take it personally, Grams. Abby was mocking everyone.\nGrams: But she was your friend. It's so hard to understand why God would take someone so young...with so much left to learn, so much left to live. It really tests one's faith.\nJen: Yeah, well, maybe I didn't have any faith to begin with.\nGrams: Well, rest assured, God may work in mysterious ways but He has a plan.\nJen: Well, if God had a plan for Abby, she certainly wasn't following it.\nGrams: God has a plan for everybody, including Abby. Including you.\nJen: Grams, I really don't want to have a religious discussion right now.\nGrams: It's times like this that--\nJen: Grams, please! Okay?\nGrams: Alright, but...I'm here for you. Whenever you need me.\n(Cut to Pacey and Andie in a deli-like restaurant.)\nPacey: I can't believe Jen would accuse you of being responsible. She was drunk, she fell, she drowned. End of story. It was nobody's fault, least of all, yours.\nAndie: Yeah, but ...I was so mean to her.\nPacey: Oh, come on, you've got to be kidding me! (to cashier) Thanks! (to Andie) Abby Morgan was one of the most hideous creatures to ever haunt the streets of Capeside and you bent over backwards to befriend her. You really shouldn't be taking this that hard, Andie.\nAndie: Don't tell me how I should be feeling. If I'm upset, then I'm upset. If I feel guilty, then I feel guilty. I think those are perfectly valid feelings.\nPacey: You're right, I'm sorry. I just don't like seeing you like this, okay?\n(Two women walk by their table. Once they're out of earshot...)\nAndie: Oh, God, Pacey. Don't look now, but Abby's mother just walked in.\n(Abby's mother turns and spots Andie and walks towards her.)\nAbby's mother: Don't I know you?\nAndie: Yes, Mrs. Morgan, I'm Andie McPhee. You drove me home once.\nAbby's mother: Oh, that's right. You're a friend of Abby's. She talked a lot about you.\n(Andie looks at Pacey, confused.)\nAndie: She did? Oh, Mrs. Morgan, I am so sorry about what happened.\nAbby's mother: Will you be coming to the funeral?\nAndie: Oh, of course...of course I will.\nAbby's mother: You know, no one's offered to give a eulogy...and I'm not really familiar with any of her other school friends, you will be saying a few words about her, won't you?\nAndie: What?\nAbby's mother: Since she was so fond of you.\nAndie: Sure...sure...\nAbby's mother: Thank you.\n(She walks away. Andie looks at Pacey, worried.)\nAndie: A eulogy?\n(She stressfully rests her head on her hand on the table. Cut to Pacey and Andie walking in the rain to Abby's house.)\nPacey: You don't have to deliver this eulogy. Just lay low. Pretend Abby's mother you're too upset.\nAndie: No. I have to find a way to honor Abby's memory both truthfully and respectively. Her family deserves that much. I'll always remember the nice things people said at my brother's funeral.\n(They reach the house, it's nice.)\nPacey: You okay?\nAndie: It just occured to me that I've never even seen her house. It's so pretty.\nPacey: Yeah, I know. I was halfway expecting this gothic castle, you know? The gargoyles leering down on you from the spires...\n(They enter the house. It's nice, lots of flowers.)\nPacey: Okay, this is morbid. Explain to me again what this is going to accomplish besides making you even more freaked out?\nAndie: I just want to see her room...you know? Where she brushed her hair, (pauses) and planned her future.\nPacey: Why?\nAndie: Look, we'll just say our condulgences and slip into her room.\n(Cut to Jen drinking liquor on the docks where there's a bunch of flowers and a cross. She takes a bouquet and throws it over the side of the docks. Cut to Andie and Pacey entering Abby's room.)\nPacey: Hey, what if Abby's mother saw us come in here together? She probably thinks I'm trying to get lucky in the middle of her daughter's memorial.\nAndie: Oh, this is really strange. It's almost like the room is waiting for her to come back...\nPacey: This is really creepy, Andie. Can we go now, please?\nAndie: (grabs a book) Wait a minute...this is her diary. The real thoughts of any girl is all in the confines of her personal diary.\nPacey: (takes it) You know what? People's privacy deserves to be respected, even in death.\nAndie: (takes it back) This isn't for my curiosity, Pacey. This is for Abby. I want to be able to give her a eulogy that does justice to her character.\n(Andie's sitting on the bed. Pacey comes and sits next to her.)\nAndie: (flipping through the book) Hmmm. (picks one) \"Dear Diary, Another unbelievably annoying day here on Walton's Mountain. That slut Jen Lindley literally stole my new boyfriend and right out from under my nose. (looks at Pacey) She's a bleach-blonde hoes-bag.\" She was probably just having a bad day.\nPacey: Sure...\nAndie: (flips and finds another one) Okay..\"Dear Diary, My mother is driving me insane. I hate her so much I must be adopted. There's no way I could share the same genes with that dried-up old wench.\"\nPacey: I'm sure it's just another bad day, right?\nAndie: (nods) Yeah. (finds another) Okay. \"Dear Diary, That new girl Andie is such a (mad) psycho! How many ways can you tell a person you don't like them...\" What?! \"She just won't take a hint! God! And that boyfriend of hers is a--\"\n(Pacey grabs it away.)\nPacey: You know what? I don't want to know. I don't want to hear it. Out the door now. Please.\n(Cut to Mitch in a classroom. Dawson walks in.)\nMitch: Dawson, hey!\nDawson: Hey.\nMitch: I was just thinking about you...\n(Dawson sits down depressingly on the desk.)\nMitch: You know, when I was young my first few experiences with death were...shocking. And as I get older, it doesn't get any easier but...it does kind of make you put your life into perspective. Makes you want to grab on to the people you love and never let go.\nDawson: And on that note...um, Mom was offered a job as a network correspondent in Philadelphia.\n(Mitch gets up and walks around the desk.)\nDawson: Don't you have anything to say?\nMitch: Um, I'll call her and congratulate her.\nDawson: That's it? You're going to call up, say congratulations, and just let her walk out of your life. (Dawson gets up angrily) Grab on to those you love, huh?\n(He leaves the room. Cut to Jack and Joey at an empty Icehouse.)\nJack: So, uh, Joey?\nJoey: Yeah?\nJack: I've tried biting my tongue, but, uh, the $64,000 question has to be asked...(speaking into the mop handle) What's up with you and Dawson?\nJoey: (smiles) Nothing.\nJack: Oh, yeah, \"nothing\". You two shared a pretty conspicuous not-a-nothing kiss the other night. Come on...\nJoey: Yeah, well, we're putting it on hold. We have enough to deal with without adding our complicated relationship to the mix so...\nJack: Alright, alright. I'll buy that...I'll buy that. So...how are you feeling otherwise?\nJoey: Um...okay. I've obviously had a lot on my mind lately but...how are you feeling about this whole thing?\nJack: Alright, I know this sounds a little morbid but...I keep thinking about how Abby and I kissed at Dawson's birthday party which means I'm probably the last person she ever kissed.\nJoey: At least she went out with a bang!\n(Jack laughs. Joey laughs and covers her face with her hands.)\nJoey: I can't believe I just said that.\nJack: I can't either.\n(They're cracking up. Cut to Dawson editing his movie.)\n(Onscreen)\nKim (Abby): Look, I am sorry if I threatened you and your safety net. And contrary to popular belief, I am not trying to ruin your life and I am trying so hard not to--\n(There's a knock at the door, offscreen. It's Pacey.)\nDawson: Hey.\nPacey: Hey, man. Working late, huh?\nDawson: Yeah.\nPacey: Your mom told me I could find you here.\nDawson: So what's up?\nPacey: I don't know, really. Mrs. Morgan asked Andie to give a eulogy indulging Abby's virtues.\nDawson: How do you speak glowingly about a girl who rode to school on a broomstick.\nPacey: It's just so frustrating, Dawson. I've been trying so hard to set everything straight for Andie, but I've got no control over these things.\nDawson: I know what you mean. That's why I'm here.\nPacey: It must be a sort of surreal experience editing a movie in which one of your leading ladies is no longer.\n(Dawson presses play.)\n(onscreen)\nKim (Abby): Look, contrary to popular belief, I did not come here to ruin your life and I am trying so hard not to do that...\n(Abby starts smiling, then laughing.)\nAbby: I'm sorry but she has food in her teeth.\n(offscreen. Pacey and Dawson laugh. Cut to Jen walking into the kitchen at her house and Grams is cooking.)\nGrams: Perfect timing. Dinner's almost ready.\n(Jen walks over and leans over the pan. Grams gets a whif.)\nGrams: Jennifer, have you been drinking again?\nJen: Not only have I been drinking, but I am drunk out of my mind.\nGrams: Jennifer, don't do this to yourself! Don't mask your grief with alcohol! I try to feel your pain, this drinking will only make things worse.\nJen: (smiling) Worse? Come on. Worse than what?\nGrams: Think of the good times you shared with Abby, she'd want you to remember her that way.\nJen: Well then you obviously didn't know Abby too well! She's probably down there with (missed name), doing tequila shooters and laughing at all of us!\nGrams: You have to believe that Abby is in God's hands. He has a special place in his kingdom for the children.\nJen: Yeah? God's got a five-bedroom beach condo in Maui for dead kids?\nGrams: Jennifer!\nJen: Okay, Grams, for the last time, there is no God and there is no heaven and there is no peace and there is no hope. The only truth that I know is pain. So you can just keep your Sunday School fables to yourself because they make me puke!\nGrams: Does it give you so much pleasure to shock and offend me?! I am trying to be understanding but you insist on disobeying my rules and polluting my house with your disrespectful blastering.\nJen: I guess you're finally sick of me, huh? I guess your infinite patience and compassion aren't as infinte as we thought. You know, if I can't just be myself and speak my mind...maybe I should just move out!\nGrams: Jennifer!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Cut to Joey and her dad eating breakfast.)\nMr.Potter: What are you thinking about?\nJoey: I've been trying to remember Mom and... I can't get a clear picture of her in my head. It was the scariest thing... I mean, it's like she's slowly fading away and ...do you know what I mean?\nMr.Potter: (nods) Joey, when I was in prison, I missed your mother. The loss combined with the guilt was almost too much for me. But...I look at you, and I know she's still here.\n(Joey looks at him, questionably.)\nMr.Potter: You are so like your mother, Joey. She was tough ...and independent ...and funny. (laughs) In the same way you're funny. She was stubborn. Oh, she was stubborn. If you would tell her the skies blue, she would say it was green.\n(Joey smiles.)\nMr.Potter: She's not gone. She lives on in you. And that comforts me to know end.\n(Cut to Pacey and Andie walking down the beach.)\nAndie: Uh, it's only a few hours til the funeral and I have no idea what I'm going to say.\nPacey: Make something up. Tell them that Abby was a wonderful person and she'll be deeply missed, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\nAndie: You want me to lie?\nPacey: Well, you could tell the truth. That she was a hideous abdomination and the world will be much better without her.\nAndie: Right and watch her mother have a heart attack and collapse into the aisle. God, Pacey, what am I going to do?\nPacey: I'll give the speech.\nAndie: You'd do that for me?\nPacey: I'd do anything to keep you from having a nervous breakdown.\nAndie: I'm not about to have a nervous breakdown.\nPacey: Well, I'm about to have a nervous breakdown living vicariously through you, so...\nAndie: Really? Listen, Pacey, I know what it's like to love someone who has the propensity to become mentally-unhinged and I don't want to be that person to you.\nPacey: Andie, what am I supposed to do? Sit back and watch you agonize. If you're in distress, how can I help but come to your rescue?\nAndie: Well, if I'm drowning in the ocean, yes, throw me a lifeline but...don't let our roles become etched in stone. I mean, me the helpless lunatic and you, the hero on horseback. I need to take care of myself. I'm going to deliver this speech, I'll think of somethin'.\nPacey: Okay...\n(He kisses her on the top of her head. Cut to Abby's funeral. Pacey and Andie are sitting in a pew.)\nPacey: Look, it's not too late to duck out of here.\nAndie: No, Pacey, I'm going to do this, even if it kills me.\nPacey: Okay, well, maybe we'll just slip you in the coffin with Abby.\n(Andie looks at him.)\nPacey: It was a joke! I'm kidding...\n(Joey walks in and takes off her black cardigan over a black dress. She walks to the pew Dawson's sitting in.)\nDawson: Hey!\n(She sits down.)\nDawson: You made it.\n(She just smiles)\nJoey: Just hold my hand.\n(Dawson smiles. Grams walks in and takes a seat next to Jen.)\nJen: It's the (missed word) of Capeside.\nGrams: Jennifer, listen, I-I lost a lot of sleep last night and I do hope that we can avoid ugly scenes like last night in the future. I wanted to let you know that I forgive you.\nJen: I'm not looking for your forgiveness, Grams. I'm looking for your understanding. And that's something that you've never been able to provide.\n(The funeral begins.)\nPreacher: We are here today, to remember the life of Abigail Morgan. But before we begin, I'd like to invite those of you, who'd like to share your memories with Abby, to come forward at this time.\n(Dawson looks around, no one's getting up. Finally, Jen gets up. She walks up to the stand.)\nJen: My name is Jen Lindley. And I was friends with Abby, as much as anyone could be because Abby had a toxic personality, in fact it was almost bordering on radioactive. Abby could be cruel and Abby could be spiteful, and Abby could certainly be petty. She spent her days mischieviously stirring up trouble, and creating calamity, and generally, taking pleasure in other people's pain. You know, in Sunday School, they teach us that God made Man in his image. Well, if God made Abby in his own image then what does that say about God? God has always been such a mystery to me. I mean, what kind of diety creates a world that is so full of suffering and so full of pain? I tell you what, Abby taught me a lot. She taught me how to do a tequilla shooter with one hand tied behind my back, and she taught me to live life by my own set of values, and not follow the crowd, in hopes of winning some phantom popularity contest. But most of all, what's most important, is Abby taught me the sadistic nature of our God and as much as that knowledge is disturbing, it's true. And it's real. And for a world that is so saturated with phoniness and lies, for that small amount, for that little bit of honesty, I will always be grateful to her.\n(Jen walks down from the pulpit and heads back to her pew, where her Grams stands up, gives Jen a incredibly angry look and walks out of the church. Abby's mother looks back at Andie while the congregation stirs from Jen's comments. Andie stands up and walks to the pulpit.)\nAndie: Um, there are people who give me comfort in my life...who when the going gets rough, which it unbearably does, I can count on them for a shoulder to cry on. And they will pick me up when I fall, and hold me in their arms while I cry and tell me that everything is going to be alright. I am so thankful for these people, they are priceless. But there's another group of people, just as important and just as priceless...they're the people who challenge me, who push me to my breaking points, and who force me to muster courage that I never thought I had. Abby Morgan was one of those people. In her own truth-telling way, she gave me strength. I'm a much stronger woman because of her. A woman who I never thought that I could be. She gave me that gift. She was one of a kind. There's no one like her and she will always hold a special place in my heart.\n(Cut to everybody outside around her coffin. Cut to Andie and Pacey putting a single yellow flower on her coffin. Cut to the priest reading from the Bible. Cut to Abby's mother crying. Cut to Jen placing a yellow flower on her coffin. Cut to everybody walking away from it. Cut to Dawson and Joey walking alone through the trees at the graveyard.)\nDawson: I was editing my movie yesterday. And I just kept watching Abby's footage over and over and over and then it hit me just how fleeting life is. You know? And I don't want to die with unlived life on my face. And I don't want to go to my grave regretting what my life could have been if I'd only taken action and maybe this is the wrong time to say this to you but Joey ...I am so happy about what happened between us the other night.\n(She just keeps on walking, showing no emotion.)\nDawson: Okay, I could just keep on talking until you say something but usually the more I talk the more chances I have at screwing up so--\n(She turns and kisses him. She smiles.)\nJoey: Of course, I'm happy. (Her expression gets somewhat sadder) Right now, I have to go someplace.\nDawson: Okay.\nJoey: Do you think you could walk me there?\nDawson: (smiles) Absolutely.\nJoey: Thanks...\n(Cut to Andie and Pacey.)\nPacey: You know, I have to admit. You have had me worried these last few days, McPhee. But, as usual, you managed to pull it off with flying colors.\nAndie: I think I needed this whole experience, Pacey. It just, it brought me closer to Tim.\n(Andie sees Jen sitting alone over by the coffin.)\nAndie: Uh, I'm going to go talk to her.\n(Cut to Jen and Andie walks up.)\nJen: Andie, I can not apoligize enough. Abby's death wasn't your fault. It was mine.\nAndie: What?\nJen: I invited her out. I got her drunk. I could have saved her.\nAndie: No, Jen, you did everything you could. The water was rough, the current was too strong.\nJen: I saw her in the water and...she was so scared...\nAndie: Jen...don't think about that, okay?\nJen: Because I'm weak, and I couldn't accept the blame, I had to deflect it onto everybody else. Onto Capeside. Onto you. Onto my Grams. And that speech! That f-(almost says it but doesn't and pauses) speech. What was I thinking, huh?\nAndie: Well, I'm a people pleaser. And sometimes in order to succeed in that, you have to be phony. Abby was the exact opposite. She put her truth above everything. And that's what you did. It was a memorial for Abby and you were just being truthful to her spirit.\nJen: Sometimes I don't think it's appropriate to speak your truth, it's better just to shut up.\nAndie: Oh, God, Jen. Abby kept a diary. It was pretty nasty. And if her mom finds it, she's going to be devastated.\n(Cut to Dawson and Joey walking past some more trees. Dawson hangs back and Joey slowly approaches a spot. Joey starts crying. It's her mother's grave [\"Lillian Josephine Potter\"]. Joey sets the flowers down and runs her finger along the etching of the gravestone. Dawson walks up slowly to her.)\nJoey: I just, um, hope wherever she is, she's happy.\nDawson: She's happy. She's looking down on you, and she's very happy.\n(Joey lays her head on Dawson's shoulder. Cut to Jen walking up the stairs to her porch where there's a bunch of suitcases, packed, and her Grams is putting more things in them.)\nJen: Grams?\nGrams: How could you, Jennifer!\nJen: You packed--up all my stuff.\nGrams: I went to that funeral today to try and give you some support, to rectify some of the damage in our fragile relationship. Only to find you heartlessly thumbing your nose at me, in a house of God no less.\nJen: Grams, that speech wasn't for you, it was for Abby. And I regret it, I do. And I know that it was wrong and I know that I offended your beliefs--\nGrams: This is not about my beliefs! Or free speech or any other philosophical nonsense, this is about the truth. And the truth is you deliberately tried to wound me in that chapel and take out all your pain and rage at the world on me.\nJen: Grams, Grams, wait!\nGrams: You want understanding? How about a little understanding in return? How about a little compassion for me? Not just about my beliefs, but for me? Your grandmother, who loves you, who would do anything for you, who would die for you!\nJen: Wait, Grams! Grandma! Wait a minute!\nGrams: You should be living with someone else. Someone who you respect, and clearly, I am not that person. All that time you spend rebelling against me is getting you nowhere. So even though it pains me more than you will ever know, Jennifer. I want you to move out. Find somewhere else to live!\n(Grams shuts the door on Jen and leans against it, crying. Cut to Jen outside crying. Cut to Andie opening the door to the Morgan's)\nAndie: Mrs. Morgan? Hello? Hello?\n(She goes up the stairs. Cut to Andie going into Abby's room. She opens a dresser drawer and pulls out the notebook and when Andie looks in the mirror. She sees Abby standing behind her in the closet wearing a white outfit. Andie spins around revealing nothing there. Andie closes her eyes, breathing heavy and opens them again. Cut to ending credits.)\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

CHANDLER [Alicia Ziegler] and her boyfriend, TIM [Andrew Lawrence] alight from the vehicle.)\nTIM: The GPS says it's right up here.\nCHANDLER: You don't even know how to use that thing!\nTIM: The hell I don't! (The GPS device in his hand beeps.) We're here.\nCHANDLER: We just drove an hour through the woods to find more woods that look just like the woods we drove through.\n(They come upon a bubbling puddle of thick ooze.)\nTIM: Eureka!\nCHANDLER: Ew! That's mud.\nTIM: No, this is like, um...(close up of the bubbling mud) yeah, it's pretty much mud.\nCHANDLER: And it smells like rotten egg.\nTIM: Mmm, sulfur. Very therapeutic. (TIM starts to strip.)\nCHANDLER: And you expect me to believe you've never been here before.\nTIM: A friend of mine told me about this place and swore me to secrecy. But this is my first time. In mud.\nCHANDLER: (laughs nervously as the Soft Misdirectional Piano of Romance starts to play in the background.)\nTIM: (from off-screen) Come on in; it's nice.\nCHANDLER: All right. (CHANDLER strips down and slips into the hot spring. The two begin kissing.) Mmmm--what, are you poking me?\nTIM: This mud is reputed to have amazing romantic properties.(They both giggle and resume making out)\nCHANDLER: Mmm...I think I got it.\nTIM: No, I think I'd notice if you got it.\nCHANDLER: (gasps as she pulls a muddy, skeletal arm from the hot spring, to the accompaniment of an Abrupt Musical Sting. The camera focuses on the hand for a long moment before CHANDLER and TIM freak out and jump out of the hot spring.)\n(The camera focuses in on the hot spring, and pulls back to reveal BOOTH's hand reaching toward the mud.)\nBOOTH: Whoa, sheesh! (BOOTH jumps backwards from the mud. A camera pan reveals that he is with BRENNAN and a PARK RANGER [Christopher May].)\nPARK RANGER: This hot spring averages a temperature of 105 degrees, but it can spike to near boiling, which is why we discourage bathers. (addressing a chagrined TIM and CHANDLER, who are sharing a muddy blanket and not much else, with a scolding tone of voice) Especially those who illegally drive four-by-four vehicles into a national park.\nBOOTH: So someone was boiled to death?\nPARK RANGER: Or had a heart attack or passed out, et cetera et cetera.\nBRENNAN: The remaining flesh will have to be macerated.\nPARK RANGER: What's that?\nBOOTH: Ugh...don't ask.\nBRENNAN: The flesh either has to be boiled off, or eaten by Dermestid beetles.\nBOOTH: Bones, why can't you just say \"cleaned\"?\nBRENNAN: (indicating several long bones.) The sulfur encrusted the bones--do you see the staining?\nBOOTH: So it's been there a long time?\nBRENNAN: Not necessarily.\nBOOTH: So why'd you have to even bring it up then?\nBRENNAN: (lifting the skull, which is severely pitted) Signs of blunt force trauma.\nPARK RANGER: What's that mean?\nBOOTH: That means he didn't pass out and boil to death on his own.\nBRENNAN: I'm going to need all of the mud.\nPARK RANGER: Excuse me?\nBRENNAN: Get a tanker truck out here and suck it up so we can filter it back at the Jeffersonian. (Long shot of the PARK RANGER exchanging a flabbergasted glance with BOOTH, who shrugs.)\nBRENNAN: (squatting, lifts up the arm) Humerus is thirty-six point five centimeters. Medium build, late twenties early thirties--he's broken this bone before.\nPARK RANGER: Is she serious about the mud?\nBRENNAN: Serious as a gas attack.\nBOOTH: Heart attack, Bones. Serious as a heart attack.\n(Medico-Legal Lab. CAM is just swiping her card to enter the Platform in a tracking shot that brings us over to the remains.)\nCAM: The description's too general to get anything from a missing person's report.\nZACK: A triangular depression in the calvarium, interior longitudinal 1 fracture, grazed cortical bone and C1; there's a patterned impression in the bone. (As he's speaking, ZACK indicates each particular instance of trauma on a magnification camera screen.)\nCAM: How many times was he hit, and by what?\nZACK: More than once, by a (questioningly) square pipe? Does that exist?\nCAM: In my experience, people hit people with anything that they can pick up and swing. (pauses) He was attacked from behind?\nZACK: Mmmm....\nCAM: (annoyed) What?\nZACK: There's a vertical impaction fracture to his glabella and frontonasal suture.\nCAM: Same weapon?\nZACK: It doesn't seem so. . . . I have seen this before.\nCAM: Great. Where?\nZACK: From sharpened stone weapons, in Neanderthal skeletons.\nCAM: I'm thinking not so relevant in this case.\nZACK: The blow to the front of the head would cause a severe laceration.\nCAM: There were no bloodstains around the mud bath.\nZACK: Indicating that the body was dumped there postmortem.\nCAM: Zack, regarding the Neanderthals-\nZACK: (correcting) Neanderthals.\nCAM: ...What was the context of those killings? (the Heavy Musical Tones of Plot Import arise in the background, and will continue onward to carry us into the credits.)\nZACK: Accepted scenarios indicate a single individual attacked by two or more assailants.\nCAM: Then we're looking for two or more murderers.\n(End Teaser.)\n(Credits.)\n(Act One)\n(Fade up on the outside of SWEETS's office building.)\nBRENNAN: (v.o.) We're not sure about time of death yet.\nBOOTH: (v.o.)It was definitely a murder.\n(Now in SWEETS's office; the Plinky Piano of Zany Hijinks arises in the background. SWEETS, for the record, could not look more bored, and is constantly shifting positions so as not to fall asleep.)\nBRENNAN: Definitely. Probably by two assailants.\nBOOTH: What a shock for that couple, huh? (gesturing) You know, they slide naked, into the hot mud bath...and a skeleton hand pokes her in the BRENNAN: (finishing) Anus.\nBOOTH: (shocked) Bones!\nBRENNAN: What? It's a clinical term for that part of the body, Booth. (SWEETS is now either sporting a hilarious, wide-eyed shock face, or trying so hard to keep his eyes open that they've bugged out of his face.)\nSWEETS: Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth...would it be fair to say that you use work to avoid confronting personal issues?\nBOOTH: Oh, what, because I don't want to talk about...\nBRENNAN: The anus.\nBOOTH: You really like that word, don't you?\nSWEETS: Do you two ever discuss anything that's not attached to work?\nBOOTH: Well, it's better than talking about, y'know...\nSWEETS: The anus?\nBOOTH: What is it with you two?\nBRENNAN: Well, Sweets could be right; I mean, we talk a lot about work.\nBOOTH: I talk about my kid.\nSWEETS: Because he was almost kidnapped during a case.\nBRENNAN: (raising a single finger) Ah, my father. We talk a lot about him.\nSWEETS: Because Agent Booth arrested him for murder.\nBOOTH: Mm...okay, what are you trying to get at here?\nSWEETS: Your inability to share your personal lives. I thought that was obvious.\nBOOTH: Okay, that was snotty. (snottily) I don't respond well to snotty.\nBRENNAN: (laying a hand on BOOTH's arm) After a case, sometimes, we have a drink, or coffee, Booth has pie. I don't...like pie.\nBOOTH: Aw...you really should just give it a chance.\nBRENNAN: I find it too sweet.\nBOOTH: Okay, there. We talked about pie. Nothin' to do with work.\nBRENNAN: It...is better when we discuss murder.\nSWEETS: I'd like to see you guys in a social situation. A situation where work is a taboo subject.\nBOOTH: What, are you gonna send us to a restaurant and watch us through a one-way mirror?\nBRENNAN: I'm still not having pie.\nSWEETS: No, an evening out with my girlfriend and me.\nBOOTH: (laughs, then, to BRENNAN) They need someone to buy them beer.\nBRENNAN: You want us to go on a double date?\nBOOTH: Why don't you go on the internet like all the rest of the kids?\nSWEETS: Okay, if it goes well, I'll withdraw my concern. I'll release you back into your environment.\nBOOTH: What are we, brook trout?\nBRENNAN: (pouts briefly, then) Fine.\nBOOTH: (Sighs heavily and plays with the stress-sumo-wrestler.)\nSWEETS: Agent Booth? (BOOTH looks away.) Unless, you think that's too much to prove.\nBOOTH: (pulls a face, then) Fine. I'll show 'em I have nothing to prove. Bring it on, Sweets.\n(He flings the stress sumo wrestler at SWEETS, who catches it one-handed and gives it a squeeze.)\n(Medico-Legal Lab; Jeffersonian. HODGINS is running the mud from the hot-spring through some sort of strainer; ZACK is examining something small.)\nHODGINS: Ugh...(Pulls a greenish aluminum can from the strainer) So far I have three old beer cans, an Indian Arrowhead, (he lifts a coin out of the strainer and casually tosses it on the table; in the background you can hear CAM swiping her card to enter the platform) seventy-three cents in change, and a partially-melted Sharpie.\nCAM: The victim was braised like osso bucco. The flesh was falling off the bone. I put time of death between ten days and two weeks.\nZACK: (crosses to a bank of x-rays) I found stress fractures and degenerative changes in the fascid joints.\nCAM: Fits with the hypertrophy of the cervical muscles. I found microscopic tearing but he had to sustain this (she extends her neck forward) position to cause that kind of wear and tear.\nHODGINS: Death by yoga?\nANGELA: (enters) Is that skull ready for me yet?\nZACK: It should be ready, you can take it out of the boiler any time.\nANGELA: Or, you could do that for me, because I will never, ever do that.\nZACK: (indicating the injuries on a bank of x-rays.) There are fractures of the pelvis, compression fractures of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, multiple metacarpal and metatarsal fractures...\nANGELA: What was he, crash test dummy?\nZACK: The injuries to the vertebrae, tibia, femur are consistent with landing on the feet after falling from ten to twenty feet.\nHODGINS: What, like jumping out of a tree?\nZACK: The damage to the scapula and the acromion resulted from a low fall but forward movement from between sixteen to twenty miles per hour.\nANGELA: Falling off a bicycle.\nZACK: These injuries are more recent. Fractured and scored patella, and torn retinaculum.\nHODGINS: Okay, even I didn't get that one.\nCAM: Why would anyone want to kill him? It seems like he was doing a good enough job on his own.\n(CUT to the exterior of the FBI building.)\nBRENNAN: (v.o.) Yes. Okay, Dr. Sweets, yeah, I'll ask him.(Now in the elevator, we see BRENNAN covers her phone) How's Wednesday night, are you free?\nBOOTH: oh, what, to have our big double date with our psychiatrist?\nBRENNAN: Just one more evening, and maybe we won't have to see him anymore.\nBOOTH: Fine. Wednesday's FINE, I can't wait, does he want me to get you a corsage?\nBRENNAN: (into the phone) Wednesday's fine. We'll meet you there. Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting her.\nBOOTH: (scowls as he pushes open the doors of his office)\nBRENNAN: Okay. Bye. (hangs up with a beep.) This might be fun. His girlfriend works with tropical fish.\nBOOTH: (skeptically) Tropical. Fish.\nBRENNAN: Yeah.\nBOOTH: This is just weird. Where are we meeting?\nBRENNAN: At their ceramics class.\nBOOTH: What? No, you're kidding.\nBRENNAN: Why would I be kidding? He said it would be a good idea to have a common activity.\nBOOTH: Ceramics? I thought the whole point of therapy was to give us peace of mind, not drive us crazy. (BOOTH's computer starts beeping; we inset to a video chat invitation on BOOTH's monitor, which reads \"JEFFERSONIAN/ANGELA\") Hey, it's Angela. (BOOTH clicks his mouse, and answers her video chat invitation.) Hey, Angela.\nANGELA: Hey! I did a rendering of our victim's face. We're checking him against any reports of missing persons.\nBOOTH: Wait a second, that's Tripp Goddard.\nANGELA: Tripp Goddard?\nBOOTH: He's a motorcycle racer.\nBRENNAN: (looks nonplussed)\nBOOTH: Oh, I forget sometimes that I'm talking to girls.\nBRENNAN: That would explain the wrist and neck injuries on Zack's report. Have him confirm with dentals.\nANGELA: Yeah, (CUT to ANGELA in the holographics suite at the Jeffersonian) I don't appreciate the \"girls\" comment.\n(CUT BACK to BOOTH and BRENNAN in BOOTH's office.)\nBOOTH: Uh...Tripp won a huge motorcycle race about two weeks ago.\nBRENNAN: That fits time of death.\n(CUT to ANGELA in the Holographics Suite at the Jeffersonian)\nANGELA: That would've been the Super Grand Prix, out in Virginia. Tripp won in the final two laps after some kind of accident took out the frontrunner. (cheekily) Girls, huh?\n(ANGELA terminates the connection, and we see an inset screen with the Jeffersonian logo and the text \"Video Conference Connection Terminated.\")\n(Slam Bolt Racing, Exterior shot of motorcycles in bright blues and yellows rounding a curve to the sound of vehicle exhaust. Racing journalist GARTH JODREY [Chris William Martin] begins a voiceover as the racers cross a finish line and the checkered flags are waved.)\nGARTH: It's not about the machine, it's about the man. (We cut to an interior shot at Slam Bolt Racing as he continues speaking.) I mean, sure you need a great bike, but a great rider on a crap bike? Still going to win. (We see that GARTH, who uses a wheelchair, has been conversing with an attractive brunette in a leather jacket, PHILIPPA FITZ [Abigail Spencer].)\nPHILIPPA: Riders say it's about the rider, mechanics say it's the machine, you know what I say? It's about whoever signs the paychecks.\nGARTH: (as BRENNAN and BOOTH come around a mechanic's station into the background of the shot) Ah, yes, and that would be you.\nPHILIPPA: (teasingly) Yes, it would; don't forget it.\nBOOTH: Excuse me. (flashes his badge) FBI Special Agent Booth, this here is Dr. Temperance Brennan of the Jeffersonian. We're looking for someone who might be able to tell us a little bit about Tripp Goddard.\nPHILIPPA: Well, I'm Philippa Fitz, and Tripp rides for our family team, Slam Bolt.\nGARTH: What did Tripp do?\nBOOTH: Who are you?\nGARTH: Garth Jodrey, I'm a journalist. (Opens his leather jacket to show a logo on his t-shirt) Motokneescrapers.com.\nBRENNAN: What does that mean?\nBOOTH: Racers, when they--they lean real low on the corners, their-their knees, they scrape the asphalt.\nBRENNAN: That would explain his knee injuries.\nPHILIPPA: No one has seen Tripp since after the Super Grand Prix.\nBRENNAN: Well, where did he go?\nPHILIPPA: After a big win, he usually takes off in his truck and climbs mountains, swims oceans, no one really knows for sure. Can I help you?\nBOOTH: Mr. Goddard's dead.\nGARTH: What? What happened?\nBRENNAN: We believe he was murdered.\n(CUT to a conversation with LENNY FITZ [Wings Hauser], PHILIPPA's father.)\nLENNY: Who would kill Tripp? I don't know.\nGARTH: (as he crosses the room.) Well, the fans loved him. Everybody else hated him.\nLENNY: Get lost, Garth.\nPHILIPPA: Daddy, please.\nLENNY: No. I want him out of here, Philippa.\n(GARTH looks up at PHILIPPA for a tense moment. She finally jerks her head, indicating that he should leave. He departs.)\nBOOTH: Garth doesn't seem to think that Tripp was the good old boy that you do.\nLENNY: His got his reasons.\nPHILIPPA: The wheelchair, for one.\nBOOTH: Tripp put him in that wheelchair?\nLENNY: It was an accident. During a race, a couple years ago.\nPHILIPPA: You can't honestly believe that Garth had anything to do with this. I mean, how? He's in a wheelchair.\nBRENNAN: With help, obviously.\nBOOTH: When was the last time you saw Tripp?\nPHILIPPA: The victory party, after the race.\nLENNY: I saw him get him his truck and leave, about midnight.\nBOOTH: Great, I'm going to need to know the make, model, the year, license plate of the truck.\nLENNY: Anything you need, we're here. Just find the b*st*rd who did this to him.\n(End Act One.)\n(Begin Act Two. \"Skinny Penny\" by the Stereotypes plays as footage of the Super Grand Prix rolls. #66, DANNY FITZ [Channon Roe] is in the lead, with #1, TRIPP GODDARD [John Edward Lee] hot on his trail. The footage cuts to a crowd shot, and back to footage of DANNY followed closely by TRIPP. More crowd shots, then it is revealed that BOOTH, BRENNAN, and GARTH are watching this footage on an LCD screen in the FBI Conference room. When we cut back to the LCD screen, the leader-board on the footage shows that TRIPP is in the lead, followed by D.J. COPPS. TRIPP crosses the finish line, and we cut to TRIPP holding the trophy, surrounded by pit crew, laughing triumphantly. DANNY tries to approach TRIPP, but is held back by pit crew.)\nGARTH: (v.o.) Okay, that's Danny Fitz. (On the screen, DANNY breaks free of his pit crew and grabs TRIPP by the front of his racing jacket. The footage pauses, but judging by their facial expressions, there is clearly an ugly altercation in the making.) I tell ya, I would've loved to have decked Tripp like that after our race, only I was in a coma for a few days.\nBRENNAN: Another Fitz?\nGARTH: Lenny's son, Philippa's twin brother... Alright, watch this. (GARTH uses a remote to manipulate the footage.) Danny's got the race in the bag. Final lap, Tripp does that. (On the tape in extreme close-up, we see TRIPP's front wheel bump DANNY's back wheel; we pull back to find that DANNY has wiped out.) Classic inside-out block pass.\nBRENNAN: Is he allowed to do that?\nBOOTH: Only if it's an accident.\nGARTH: Slam Bolt would've taken first and second against Flame Spark if Tripp hadn't of clipped Danny.\nBRENNAN: (laughs) There's someone named Flame Spark?\nBOOTH: Yeah; Flame Spark Spark Plugs. It's Slam Bolt's rival team.\nTRIPP: (on the tape) I saw a little daylight. Looked like Danny was gonna go wide, so I went for it. I mean, it is a bummer when somebody loses the front of their bike like that, but, um...(TRIPP shrugs) Whaddaya gonna do?\nGARTH: Danny had that race in the bag.\nBOOTH: Tripp did the same thing to you, didn't he?\nGARTH: (a beat) Yeah. Well, I guess Tripp didn't learn anything from the time he did it to me.\nBOOTH: Danny Fitz, was he at the victory party?\nGARTH: Yeah, absolutely. Put on a face for the press.\nBRENNAN: Did Danny leave before, or after Tripp?\nGARTH: About the same time.\nBOOTH: How about you?\nGARTH: I took off right after.(On the videotape, TRIPP and DANNY are engaged in a shoving match.)\nBOOTH: You're good friends with Danny, aren't you?\nGARTH: You mean, are we good enough friends to kill Tripp together? You know, I'm pretty sure I don't have to say anything without a lawyer. (BRENNAN and BOOTH exchange a look.)\n(MEDICO-LEGAL LAB; the JEFFERSONIAN. A metal bar falls on the floor between two feet, which we see are ZACK's, as ZACK is carrying in an armload of potential murder weapons. ZACK bends down to pick up the bar. HODGINS looks over at him before going back to examining the now extremely clean skull. As ZACK finally corrals the first bar he dropped, he loses control of another bar.)\nHODGINS: (testily.) It's not going to work...\nZACK: What?\nHODGINS: Dropping loud pieces of metal to hurry me up.\nZACK: I need the skull so I can compare tool marks to potential murder weapons.\nHODGINS: Just going to have to wait.\nZACK: (frowns and walks further into the room.)\nHODGINS: (zooms in to an extreme close-up of the skull's surface on a monitor. A computer program isolates particulates on the screen.) Titanium, magnesium, and heat-treated boron particulates are embedded in the skull fractures.\nZACK: Mmmmm....\nHODGINS: What?\nZACK: That's a unique and exotic combination of metals not found in any of these...(A bunch of the aforementioned \"these\" go sliding out of ZACK's arms, and he bends down to collect them.)\nHODGINS: It is possible that these particulates aren't from the tool, I mean, not from the tool alone.\nZACK: I don't understand.\nHODGINS: Hand-made racing motorcycles are made from these metals.\nZACK: So the particles could've gone from the bicycles to the tools to the victim.\nHODGINS: It's-it's not a bicycle. It's a motorcycle.\nZACK: (irritably) Bi-cycle. Two wheels. The term applies. (He drops another group of the metal bars, and bends down to collect them.)\nHODGINS: Drop those. (off his look.) Drop them. I mean it Zack, bombs away. (ZACK drops all the weapons to the floor.)\nZACK: I don't know what that proves.\nHODGINS: It means I don't handle irritation as well as I'd like.\nZACK: Can I pick these up now?\nHODGINS: (forcefully) No. (ZACK looks at him quizzically, and HODGINS crosses the room towards him.) You can pick one up. Most likely culprit.\nZACK: A narrow instrument, no more than an inch, caused the injuries.\nHODGINS: Okay...(HODGINS bends down and proceeds to pick up more than one bar.)\nZACK: Strain, the crushing, tearing, shearing, equals a change in dimension divided by the original dimension.\nHODGINS: I do bugs and slime; I don't do arithmetic.\nZACK: An elongated rod, with (he selects a shiny, square-shaped pipe from the group HODGINS has selected) this cross-section, is the most likely culprit.\nHODGINS: Good. Good job, Zack.\nZACK: (confused) Am I...King of the Lab?\nHODGINS: We both are. (HODGINS drops the remaining crowbars.) Let's go tell Cam.\n(FBI Conference room. BOOTH is replaying the footage of DANNY FITZ wiping out over and over again and giggling. A slow pan reveals an unamused DANNY.)\nBOOTH: Ooohhhh....ouch....Okay, now that, that's gotta hurt. Wait, here it comes again, I mean, look at that. Whoa...watch it, watch out, watch out, whoa! (BOOTH jumps backwards to reveal the unamused face of DANNY's lawyer, BRAXTON SMALLS [M.C. Gainey])\nSMALLS: Let the record show that Agent Booth is taunting my client by repeatedly showing footage of his traumatic accident.\nDANNY: Don't say accident, man; Tripp did that to me on purpose.\nBRENNAN: How fast were you going at the time of your incident?\nDANNY: I don't know, exactly. I was accelerating through 160.\nBOOTH: Tripp was accelerating faster; see there? (BOOTH punches a button on the remote. The footage replays on the screen.) Whoosh.\nSMALLS: Again with taunting.\nBRENNAN: Why was Tripp so much better than you?\nSMALLS: Taunting?\nBRENNAN: No, I'm not taunting, Mr. Smalls, I'm restating an objective fact.\nDANNY: Tripp had a better bike! He had maybe twenty horses on me.\nBOOTH: So you get Tripp's bike now, right, Mr. Fitz?\nDANNY: I didn't kill Tripp for his motorcycle.\nBOOTH: Why did you kill him?\nSMALLS: Whoa, full stop there, cowboy.\nBOOTH: Alright, don't sweat it there, princess. Alright, any other reason why you'd want to get rid of Tripp?\nDANNY: No.\nSMALLS: Danny, certain things you hide make you look guilty.\nDANNY: Couple years back, Tripp was going out with my sister. Cheated on her with a groupie.\nSMALLS: Came to blows.\nBRENNAN: Who won?\nDANNY: I did, for once. Knocked him on his ass!\nBOOTH: And you defended her honor.\nSMALLS: Danny and Philippa are twins, Agent Booth. They're very close.\nBOOTH: He cheated on your sister, forced you to crash...How'd you exactly describe your relationship with Tripp?\nDANNY: (snidely) We were the best of friends.\nSMALLS: As your lawyer, I must caution you that sarcasm doesn't show up on the transcript. Best to avoid it.\nDANNY: Look, I'm sorry Tripp's dead, but I'm not exactly grievin', you feel me?\nBOOTH: Bones, he's not afraid of me at all.\nBRENNAN: It's hard to scare someone who rides around a track at 200 miles an hour.\nDANNY: Now her, I like. (to BRENNAN) D'you wanna go out sometime? (BRENNAN looks surprised.)\nSMALLS: Restrain yourself.\nBOOTH: Nah, she doesn't wanna go out with you.\nBRENNAN: Let me speak for myself!\nBOOTH: Murder suspect, here, Bones. (Cut to a hilariously lecherous facial expression of DANNY's. BRENNAN looks skeptical.)\n(Medico-Legal Lab; Jeffersonian. The Original Recipe Squint Squad + Cam are in the side room at the lab.)\nCAM: The wound at the front of the head or at the back?\nZACK: Back.\nANGELA: Could it be both?\nZACK: No.\nCAM: The blow to the front of the head was from a sharp tool.\nZACK: Sharper than round, but blunter than sharp.\nANGELA: What?\nCAM: That actually made sense to me.\nANGELA: You two have been spending way too much time together.\nHODGINS: Can you estimate the amount of force?\nZACK: In the back of the head, length undetermined. A width of 3.8 centimeters; approximately a thousand pounds of force.\nANGELA: So a lot.\nHODGINS: (like it's no big deal) Half a ton.\nANGELA: Which is a lot.\nZACK: That actually isn't very much.\nANGELA: All right; now I'm back in a physics class I want to ditch.\nHODGINS: A boxer's fist can land with double that force.\nCAM: A big meaty fist in a glove.\nHODGINS: Yeah, with the force spread out over a hell of a lot more than 3.8 centimeters.\nZACK: Correct. It wouldn't take all that much force to crush a skull with this.\nCAM: So. We haven't eliminated anyone from our list of suspects. Plus, we don't know what that's a cross-section of, and we don't know what caused the damage to the front of the face. (taking in ZACK and HODGINS' nonplussed faces as the Piano Music of Zany Hijinks rears its head on the soundtrack.) What, exactly, made you two come in here crowing \"King of the Lab\"?\nHODGINS: (opens his mouth to speak, then closes it and points at ZACK, who stares back at him.) I'm gonna go back and look at very small things under my very large microscope. (HODGINS leaves. CAM glances at ZACK.)\nZACK: I can probably identify the type of tool off this cross section.\nCAM: Do it and call Booth. See if it's of any use to him. (ZACK turns to leave.)\nANGELA: (conspiratorially, to CAM.) Boys.\nCAM: Wow.\n(Medico-Legal Lab; HODGINS and ZACK's workstations.)\nHODGINS: (on the phone to BOOTH) I don't have the weapon, but, I microwaved the fabric samples and used gas sensors to analyze\n(Slam Bolt Racing; BOOTH and BRENNAN are standing by a yellow and white motorcycle.)\nBOOTH: (cutting HODGINS off mid-sentence.) Alright, alright; just--let's just cut to the chase, there, okay, Mr. Wizard?\n(Medico-Legal Lab)\nHODGINS: (shrugs) I have identified what was on the victim's clothing.\n(Slam Bolt Racing)\nBOOTH: Fine. I'll take anything at this moment.\nBRENNAN: What is it?\nHODGINS: (through BOOTH's Blackberry) It's toluene. It's a clear liquid used to clean up oil.\nBOOTH: (agitatedly.) How is that supposed to help us? Every mechanic in the world uses that stuff. (BRENNAN, with a pensive expression on her face, examines a rack against a wall.) I need a weapon; do you hear me? A weapon.\n(Medico-Legal Lab; Jeffersonian.)\nHODGINS: You know, I'm feeling really underappreciated today.\nBOOTH: Alright, well, you know what?--\n(Slam Bolt Racing)\nBOOTH: (continued) You can suck it up, buttercup.\nBRENNAN: Booth?\nBOOTH: Yah?\nBRENNAN: (opens the door on a yellow rack of conveniently-labeled chemicals; the foremost container is labeled \"Toluene\" in larger lettering than any of the other bottles. BRENNAN points at it.) Toluene.\nHODGINS: (over BOOTH's Blackberry.) It's also excellent for cleaning up blood.\nBRENNAN: So, if you killed someone here, and they bled a lot...\nBOOTH: (looks over at a drain in the middle of the floor.) The drain...(to an FBI Forensics Technician [Burnadean Jones])Hey, check this drain for blood.\n(Medico-Legal Lab)\nHODGINS: Blood suspended in toluene might be testable for DNA.\nBRENNAN: (sotto voce) Tell Hodgins he did a good job.\nBOOTH: Tell Hodgins he did a good job, if...(He trails off when he sees blood spatter leading towards the drain by the blue glow of the FBI technician's ALS.)\nHODGINS: (over BOOTH's Blackberry) I'm waiting.\n(End Act Two.)\n(Begin Act Three. BOOTH and BRENNAN are in Dr. SWEETS's office. The bass xylophone and heavy brass sounds of Work-related hijinks are on the soundtrack. BOOTH looks less than happy to be visiting Dr. SWEETS. BRENNAN starts to say something, then doesn't. The awkward silence continues. Finally BOOTH breaks it.)\nBOOTH: I hate when you do this.\nSWEETS: Do what?\nBOOTH: You don't talk.\nSWEETS: Sometimes you hate when I talk, so it's a double-edged sword.\nBOOTH: Bones doesn't mind sitting in silence, do ya?\nBRENNAN: (answering in the negative) Mm-mmm.\nBOOTH: I hate it.\nSWEETS: Why do you think that is?\nBRENNAN: He gets bored.\nBOOTH: You're right, I do, I get bored.\nBRENNAN: You should see him on stakeouts; he talks and talks and ---(BOOTH stares at her) Well, it's very interesting!\nSWEETS: Is it always about work?\nBRENNAN: Mmm...no.\nSWEETS: (cocks his head.) You're lying!\nBOOTH: Aw, c'mon. How do you know that?\nSWEETS: I have special training in how to tell when people are lying.\nBRENNAN: Is that true?\nSWEETS: See, if you were me, you'd know.\nBOOTH: (stares.)\nSWEETS: You're lying to protect your partner. I understand that. But let's agree amongst ourselves, that this is a truth zone. (BOOTH groans and pinches the bridge of his nose.) Is something bothering you?\nBOOTH: It's this whole...going on a date thing.\nBRENNAN and SWEETS in stereo: No, it's not a date!\nSWEETS: (continuing) It's a social outing for the purpose of professional evaluation.\nBOOTH: Come on; ceramics? I'm not that kind of a guy, alright? Whaddaya say we go, y'know, bowling, or to a firing range, or climbing a wall?\nSWEETS: Oh, right. Something you're good at.\nBOOTH: A movie! Or dinner. Dinner and a movie. Somewhere that I don't have to make something.\nBRENNAN: (exhales) Oooohhh...\nBOOTH: What? What oooh?\nBRENNAN: Well, what Sweets would do in this situation is he'd jump on word usage. He's going to ask you why you're resistant to making.\nSWEETS: (indignantly) I JUMP on the semantics? (shakes his head) That's a really aggressive turn of phrase.\nBOOTH: Ha. Thanks for pulling focus, there, Bones. (SWEETS starts to shake his head.) Pulling. Is that an aggressive word too?\nSWEETS: Okay, what, did you two plan this?\nBOOTH: It's paranoia! That is paranoia.\nBRENNAN: Since this is a truth zone, I will tell you the truth. We didn't plan anything. (SWEETS examines her shrewdly and she meets his eyes.)\nSWEETS: You're telling the truth.\nBOOTH: He's guessing, Bones.\nSWEETS: (giddy, like a little kid.) We're going to a ceramics class, and we're all going to MAKE something. Time's up.\n(Melville Practice Track at Slam Bolt Racing. Motorcycle #38 is rounding a corner as \"Get it Right\" by Mink plays on the soundtrack. #38, #42, and #1 are all on the track.)\nBOOTH: (v.o.) Look, Sweets can't really tell if someone's lying. (Cut to BRENNAN and BOOTH walking along a side track.) I'm telling you, he's playing with our minds.\nBRENNAN: There's an area of study called neurolinguistics which proposes that subconscious eye movements and body language tell a well-trained observer if the subject is lying.\nBOOTH: Well, I don't believe it. (As they round the corner of a trailer, one can see GARTH JODREY in blurred focus in the foreground.) Ha. I don't believe it. (DANNY is standing by GARTH and LENNY next to the #1 bike.)\nBRENNAN: Is that Tripp's bike?\nBOOTH: Hyeah; looks like Danny's gonna finally get what he wants, huh?\nLENNY: Do me a favor, son. Take it easy, a couple times around, before you blast off, okay?\nDANNY: I know, Dad. Ease into it.\nGARTH: Hey, can I get a picture?\nBOOTH: Yeah, let's get a picture. Look at that. # 1 of the Slam Bolt racing team. You gotta feel good about that.\nDANNY: I'm not talkin' to you without my lawyer present. (DANNY dons his motorcycle helmet.)\nLENNY: That goes for all of us. (to DANNY) Look, you, I can replace. Do NOT wreck my bike. (DANNY revs the engine and pops a low wheelie before taking off around the track with a screech.)\nGARTH: Y'know, Lenny, I'm thinkin' your boy isn't gonna relax into this.\nLENNY: Well, Danny gets a chance to grab the brass ring, he's gonna take it.(DANNY revs the engine into the curve.)\nBOOTH: Okay, watch this, Bones, he's gonna decelerate right before the turn and just slingshot right through it.\nBRENNAN: I don't see the deceleration part. (Something is clearly wrong with DANNY; the bike begins to shake and then to bank heavily right, then heavily left.)\nLENNY: No, no, no! (DANNY's last bank turns into a wipeout in a shower of sparks as he scrapes across the track. He's thrown free of the bike; however, it explodes in a ball of flame that engulfs him. GARTH, ever the photojournalist, continues snapping pictures as BRENNAN and BOOTH run towards DANNY. LENNY merely stares catatonically.)\nSAFETY CREWMEMBER: He's down! Come on, let's get in there.\nPHILIPPA: (was watching from her car; she sprints to where DANNY is on the track) No! NOOO!!! No! No! (LENNY sinks to his knees as PHILIPPA grabs him by the arm. DANNY and the BIKE have now become separate fireballs as the Plinky Piano of Loss plays on the soundtrack and two fire-extinguisher bearing members of the Slam Bolt safety crew come running up.)\nPHILIPPA:Not Danny. (In the corner of the shot, GARTH appears to be classily photographing PHILIPPA and LENNY's reaction.)\nBRENNAN: (on her cellphone) Yes, we're at the Melville practice track on Highway 64. Send an air ambulance now; there's been a motorcycle accident.\n(End Act Three.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Begin Act Four; interior shot at the Slam Bolt Garage. An FBI forensics team is photographing the charred remains of the bike; to the left of the shot, FBI Motor Tech OPAL WARNEKE [Darlena Tejeiro] is feeding data into a computer.The Sad Piano of Loss is still playing on the soundtrack. PHILIPPA walks through the garage.)\nBRENNAN: (to PHILIPPA) Where's your father?\nPHILIPPA: He's at the house. He's already had two heart attacks; he doesn't need to be here for this.\nOPAL: Seems like a crime to mess up such a sweet bike, huh?\nBOOTH: Yeah, a crime, like murder.\nOPAL: (backtracking) Right. I..I just meant the bike itself, it's...\nBOOTH: No, I get it. You like bikes.\nOPAL: (pointing to a part she has in her hand.) These rotors are laser cut and honed. Very exact. Bend one just a little, and when this baby gets to speed the rotor hits a brake pad. Separates a little farther, and the next thing you know...\nBRENNAN: Yes. We saw.\nBOOTH: So it couldn't have been an accident...\nOPAL: You mean oops, I accidentally stuck a piece of metal through this little tiny hole and pushed it with all my might?\nBRENNAN: So anyone could have done this?\nOPAL: Anyone who's familiar with motorcycles. And was a killer.\nPHILIPPA: Why would anyone want to kill Danny?\nBRENNAN: (takes PHILIPPA by the shoulder and walks her away.) You can't be near the evidence. I'm sorry.\nBOOTH: (to OPAL) See what else you can find, will ya?\nOPAL: (nods.)\n(Medico-Legal Lab; Jeffersonian. HODGINS is adding a few drops of the reagent Eugenol to the tip of a cotton swab.)\nHODGINS: Recovering ink traces on plastic and polymers is problematic, so, I am using a new technique. A little of the reagent Eugenol, and (He holds the plastic piece [the melted Sharpie from the sifting-the-mud scene] under a blue light, revealing the letters \"EE S APERS DO CO\") Voila. E-eh say-pers doh coh.\nZACK: Does that mean anything to you?\nHODGINS: Korean restaurant?\nZACK: Unlikely. There are obviously missing letters. We need to place the consonants most likely to appear with this configuration of vowels. And vowels to consonants.\nHODGINS: That is an enormous amount of variables, Zack.\nZACK: Shh...Lee Snappers Doll Company.\nHODGINS: Don't think so.\nZACK: Free Newspapers Dot Com. Keen Snappers Don't Come.\nHODGINS: Definitely not.\nZACK: Knee Scrapers Dot Com.\nHODGINS: Oh my God. That's it. Motokneescrapers.com . How'd you do that?\nZACK: Process of elimination? You realize I have no idea what it means.\nHODGINS: It's the website run by the journalist that Tripp put in a wheelchair.\nZACK: So this man's pen was found on the murder victim.\nHODGINS: Or, it fell in the mud when the body was dumped.\n(Exterior shot of the Capitol, for no apparent reason. When we fade up, BRENNAN is in Ceramics Class with BOOTH, SWEETS, and his girlfriend, APRIL PRESA [Senta Moses], smiling as the pot she is throwing begins to take shape.)\nBRENNAN: I'm enjoying this. The last time I threw pots I was in Colombia with the Auroco Indians.\nBOOTH: (griping) Last time I did something like this, I was in nursery school.\nAPRIL: (laughs) Well, we love it. Don't we, Lance?\nSWEETS: (smiles, forcedly) Yes.\nBOOTH: Well, I love my work, but I'm not going to talk about that right now, even though we think a paraplegic killed Tripp Goddard.\nAPRIL: That sounds fascinating.\nSWEETS: April?\nAPRIL: Oopsie! (forced giggle.)\nBRENNAN: (changing the subject) Dr. Sweets says that you work with tropical fish.\nAPRIL: Yes, I love fish. They're just like people.\nBRENNAN: No, no they're not, actually. People can't breathe underwater.\nAPRIL: (starts laughing.) She's funny.\nBOOTH: (snickers along.)\nBRENNAN: I am? What? Why is that funny?\nBOOTH: I don't think she meant that literally, Bones.\nBRENNAN: Oh.\nAPRIL: It's their eyes. You can tell so much from eyes.\nBRENNAN: The retinal scan is as specific as a fingerprint.\nAPRIL: No, no. Their souls. You can see their little souls.\nBRENNAN: I don't understand. You believe that fish have souls?\nAPRIL: Yes. You can see it in their coloring; it's a reflection of who they are.\nBRENNAN: (still confused.) Their coloring has developed over millennia as a way to deal with predators.\nSWEETS: (To BRENNAN and BOOTH) April just means they're beautiful.\nAPRIL: Don't tell me what I mean, Lance. I mean they have souls.\nSWEETS: Ah, okay.\nBOOTH: Hey, look what I'm makin'! (BOOTH proudly spreads his hands to reveal that, where APRIL, SWEETS, and BRENNAN have been using pottery wheels to throw similar thin-walled pots, he has constructed the beginnings of what looks to be a well-detailed carousel horse.)\nBRENNAN: You've done this before.\nBOOTH: (modestly) Nah...\nBRENNAN: You have.\nBOOTH: You really think that's good?\nBRENNAN: Yes, very.\nSWEETS: Yours is good too, April.\nAPRIL: I'm not talking to you.\nSWEETS: (snickers nervously)\nAPRIL: You think that's funny.\nBRENNAN: (stage whispers to BOOTH) Are they fighting?\nBOOTH: Just focus on your pot there.\nSWEETS: I'm with patients, April.\nBOOTH: Nope, no patients tonight. Just us people makin' pots.\nAPRIL: You can't apologize for me, Lance.\nSWEETS: Can we please just move on?\nAPRIL: No. It just-- I meant that, I believe that all creatures, people, fish, dogs, we're all connected. We all share the same stuff that makes life so beautiful and precious.\nBRENNAN: On a quantum level, that's true, although the word stuff is not accurate.\nAPRIL: (smiles gratefully at BRENNAN, then, snidely, to SWEETS) See? (she slams a towel down on the table.)\nSWEETS: What? I have great respect for your fish. Admittedly, I might relate to other things more.\nAPRIL: He kills about a thousand people a night.\nSWEETS: Yeah, in a video game, April. They're not real.\nBOOTH: Hey, Sweets, your thing there's droopy. (SWEETS's tall pot is starting to collapse like the Leaning Tower of Pisa.)\nSWEETS: (looks upset, then sighs.)\nBOOTH: Look at my horse!\nAPRIL: Wow.\nSWEETS: That's amazing, Agent Booth.\nBOOTH: (makes horse-like noises as he moves the horse up and down as though it's galloping.)\nBRENNAN: Very impressive.\nBOOTH: Yes, it is. (BOOTH picks a stray piece of clay off the back of the horse and goes to flick it away; it strikes BRENNAN in a fairly personal region and she gasps.) Bones, I'm sorry. (BRENNAN slings back a lump of clay.) Ooh! Jeez! (BOOTH throws back a lump, and it destroys the top part of BRENNAN's pot. BRENNAN pouts.) Hey, Sweets, I apologize. (BOOTH begins breaking off more pieces of clay to sling at BRENNAN) This whole ceramics thing is GREAT! (SWEETS gets a big smile on his face.)\nSWEETS: (As BOOTH and BRENNAN continue to laugh, SWEETS breaks off a piece of clay and lightly tosses it at APRIL. She, in turn, grabs a handful of slip [clay with a liquid consistency] and slings it in SWEETS's face, even getting some on his teeth. It's very ugly. SWEETS tries to play it off with a nonchalant laugh.) Yeah, this is fun. (When BRENNAN has figured out what just happened and you're still trying to play it off, you're in trouble, dude.)\n(Random exterior nighttime shot of the Washington Monument with Dupont Circle behind it, and a shot of sunrise behind the Capitol building.)\n(BOOTH's car; daytime.)\nBOOTH: I tell you one thing, Sweets didn't get any last night.\nBRENNAN: They're too young to be in a serious relationship. In agrarian societies, young couplings made sense; the partnership was for survival, but today...\nBOOTH: You know, you can play the field and not plow it.\nBRENNAN: That was distasteful.\nBOOTH: What?\nBRENNAN: I like April, though.\nBOOTH: She talks to fish, okay? I'm with Sweets on this one.\nBRENNAN: (gives BOOTH a look. BRENNAN's phone rings as BOOTH comes to the not-at-all inaccurate conclusion that his comment might've pushed the boundaries of decency. She answers the phone.)\n(Medico-Legal Lab; Jeffersonian. Room with all the drawers.)\nZACK: Hey, it's Zack.\n(BOOTH's CAR)\nBRENNAN: Hi, Zack. (BRENNAN punches a button on the phone and puts it on speaker.)\n(Medico-Legal Lab)\nZACK: The prybar from the garage is not the murder weapon. It's a prybar like this one, but not this one. The deep parallel grooves on the interior border are not a match.\nBOOTH: What about the blood?\nHODGINS: Apparently, the toluene---\n(BOOTH's CAR)\nHODGINS: (over speakerphone, continued) caused a false positive.\nBRENNAN: What about the vertical fracture on the frontal suture?\nBOOTH: (pleased with himself and seeking approval) That's the forehead.\nBRENNAN: (looks at him strangely)\nHODGINS: Yeah, I did another scraping of the fracture and I found a sliver of glass with--\n(Medico-Legal Lab)\nHODGINS: (continued) --a mastic film on it. The mass spec shows it as a nitrate of silver, so I think we're looking for some kind of mirror.\nBRENNAN: Good! Thank you.\n(BOOTH's SUV pulls up to a wooded area.)\nOPAL: (v.o.) Found it--\n(We now see TRIPP's TRUCK, as OPAL lifts the crime scene tape surrounding it.)\nOPAL: --early this morning. No way of knowing how long it's been here. My guess is it was stolen, driven around some, then stripped for parts.\nBRENNAN: VIN number matches?\nOPAL: Oh, it's the victim's truck, all right. (Conspiratorially, to BRENNAN) Hey, I gotta tell you, I love working this one. I'm usually looking over some battered old heap for evidence, but the vehicles on this case (she exhales appreciatively) they are sweet.\nBOOTH: You got anything else for me?\nOPAL: Ah, they're testing mud on the bottom of the vehicle on the chance it might match where the victim was dumped.\nBRENNAN: Pry bar.\nBOOTH: Huh?\nBRENNAN: Pry bar.\nOPAL: Yup. Covered in blood. I blame the Stooges.\nBRENNAN: Excuse me?\nOPAL: The Three Stooges. They're always bashing each other in the heads with hammers and bricks and stuff, and never got hurt. People think they can do it too.\nBOOTH: Yeah. Thanks for that.\nOPAL: All I'm saying is that killings like this are Stooge-related.\nBRENNAN: Booth...\nBOOTH: Yeah?\nBRENNAN: Side mirror. (They both approach the truck.) Long jagged edge. He was standing by his truck, someone came up behind him and hit him with a prybar.\nBOOTH: Falls forward into the mirror.\nBRENNAN: Fracturing his frontonasal suture.\nOPAL: Huh?\nBRENNAN AND BOOTH: Forehead.\nBRENNAN: Booth, this suggests only one assailant.\nBOOTH: Can we get some lumino; check the mirror for blood?\nOPAL: Well, we're not hurting for blood around here. (She walks to the truck's in-bed storage container, which she pops open to reveal that it's streaked with blood.)\nBOOTH: Oh, jeez. Whoa! Whoa.\nOPAL: Don't need any luminol for this.\nBOOTH: So he was killed, loaded in the box, driven to the mud, and dumped.\nBRENNAN: That's physically impossible for a paraplegic to do.\nBOOTH: It's only one murderer; it wasn't Garth. Do we have any prints?\nOPAL: Just the victim's, but we did find some hair in the box where the body was placed. (An FBI Forensic Tech hands her a bag with the hair in it.) It's dyed. We're checking for the exact brand and color.\nBRENNAN: The roots are gray...it's short.\nBOOTH: Lenny Fitz...dyes his hair.\nBRENNAN: Why would Lenny kill his most valuable rider?\n(End Act Four.)\n(Begin Act Five. FBI Interrogation room. LENNY is massaging his forehead, accompanied by his attorney, SMALLS.)\nSMALLS: I'd like the record to reflect that my client has been drinking.\nLENNY: That's an understatement.\nSMALLS: And that he's rejecting my advice not to speak to you at this time.\nBOOTH: Did you drink a lot there, Lenny? Maybe out of guilt?\nLENNY: I lost a son, Agent Booth. A son. So excuse me for feelin' bad about that, all right?\nBRENNAN: Do you mean your biological son, or Tripp Goddard?\nLENNY: Lady, I loved Tripp Goddard like a son, but Danny--Danny was my son. There's a difference.\nSMALLS: I'm confused. Is my client a person of interest in this, or an actual suspect, and in which death?\nBRENNAN: Well, that depends upon whether or not the same person killed both Danny Fitz and Tripp Goddard.\nLENNY: You can't honestly think that I killed either one of them!\nBOOTH: Well, we found Tripp's truck.\nLENNY: Where?\nBOOTH: Clearing in Jackson State Park.\nBRENNAN: Forensic evidence shows that Tripp was murdered in the mechanic's bay and his body was transported in his own truck.\nSMALLS: What's that got to do with my client?\nBRENNAN: There's forensic evidence tying him (indicating LENNY) to the body.\nSMALLS: (disdainfully) What you got, a nail clipping, a piece of dried snot, a hair?\nBOOTH: No, we've got forensic evidence.\nSMALLS: Lenny, when was the last time you saw Tripp?\nLENNY: I told you, at the victory party.\nSMALLS: You shook hands with him, sat next to him at the bar, didja make out a little?\nLENNY: I hugged him.\nSMALLS: Any other questions about how trace evidence from my client may have wound up on Tripp's remains?\nBOOTH: Just hold him on suspicion; that's all. (BOOTH and BRENNAN rise to leave.)\nLENNY: Look, I didn't kill Tripp!\nSMALLS: I can get a court order to release him in less than an hour.\nLENNY: Look, why would I kill someone I just signed a business deal with?\nBOOTH: Wait, you---you what?\nSMALLS: Mr. Fitz signed ten percent of his company over to Tripp.\nBOOTH: You mean the motorcycle team.\nSMALLS: No, Mr. Fitz means the beverage company.\nBRENNAN: Slam Bolt Energy Drinks? (SMALLS nods.) Why offer so much?\nLENNY: Because he was the best. SO I offered him a piece of the business, as an incentive to race exclusively for Slam Bolt.\nSMALLS: And everybody's happy.\nBOOTH: Who isn't happy?\nLENNY: Every other motorcycle team.\nBRENNAN: Did Tripp Goddard sign?\nLENNY: I only got him the contract that night.\nSMALLS: And then hugged him.\nBOOTH: So you signed it, but he didn't.\nSMALLS: We don't know. (pauses, during which the Heavy Piano of Plot Import kicks up again.) You haven't found the contract, have you? (BRENNAN looks up at BOOTH, who is standing.)\nBOOTH: We'll be in touch. (BRENNAN stands and they both leave. LENNY buries his face in his hands.)\n(Exterior shot. BOOTH's SUV drives by a government building with Corinthian columns.)\nBOOTH: (starts out in v.o.) Sexual jealousy as a motive didn't pan out, professional jealousy was looking pretty good....\nBRENNAN: Until Danny was killed.\nBOOTH: But money, that's always good.\nBRENNAN: (exhales) How much money?\nBOOTH: Well, company like Slam Bolt? Millions is my guess.\nBRENNAN: Tripp Goddard could've been attacked by more than one person; the skull shows that as a possibility.\nBOOTH: No changies, Bones. Prybar to the back of the skull, mirror to the face, no takebacks, one killer.\nBRENNAN: I'm just saying that maybe Philippa and Danny didn't like it when their father signed over a chunk of their family company to Tripp Goddard.\nBOOTH: Well, it's a good business decision. (off BRENNAN's look) Look, Garth wants Tripp dead for puttin' him in a wheelchair. Philippa wants Tripp dead for grabbing up a hunk of her father's company.\nBRENNAN: Two killers again? You said no changies and no takebacks.\nBOOTH: It doesn't scan. You know, ah...why would either Garth or Philippa want Danny dead?\nBRENNAN: You're the motive guy.\nBOOTH: Look, we found Garth's \"knee scrapers\" pen in the mud...\nBRENNAN: No, that doesn't prove anything. He gave them out to everybody.\nBOOTH: (scowls) It's...it's right here, Bones, it's right in front of us...but I just--can't get it.\nBRENNAN: That whole business with changies and takebacks --that's not real, right?\nBOOTH: No. (BRENNAN glances in a variety of directions. BOOTH looks over at her.) But I have another question.\nBRENNAN: Is there anything more we can learn from the murder weapon?\nBOOTH: No, that's a you question. My question is, how did the murderer know about the secret mud hole.\n(BOOTH's OFFICE. TIM is sitting in front of Booth's desk, on which a Philadelphia Flyers candy jar and a Pittsburgh Steelers coffee mug are sitting.)\nTIM: Look. I know I was breakin' the rules when I drove my truck on national park land. But, I mean, this girl...Didn't you see her?\nBOOTH: (is lining up a putt on his mini-golf set.) I really don't care about that.\nTIM: Come on, man, have a heart!\nBOOTH: Look, I got it about the girl the minute I saw her, okay? We all do things..(he putts) for the girl.\nTIM: So what do you need to talk to me for?\nBOOTH: I need to know how you found out about that mudhole.\nTIM: Oh.\nBOOTH: Oh, what?\nTIM: I don't wanna be a rat, you know?\nBOOTH: Look, sport, I don't care about the girl, or the mud, or the four-by-four, okay? Hardly anyone knows about that place and someone dumped a body there.\nTIM: (reluctantly) My friend told me about it.\nBOOTH: I need a name.\nTIM: He didn't do it; he's in a wheelchair.\nBOOTH: Your friend's name Garth Jodrey?\nTIM: How'd you know that?\nBOOTH: (points to his nameplate on his desk) Special Agent Seeley Booth. (with emphasis) Special.(He claps TIM on the shoulder.)\n(Jeffersonian, exterior shot. Day.)\nZACK: (v.o.) This is the shaft--\n(Interior, Medico-Legal Lab. Platform. We are focused on the prybar.)\nZACK: (continued)--of the prybar. It's made of tempered steel with a shiny chrome covering.\nBRENNAN: The murder weapon we found on Tripp's truck.\nZACK: Yes. As you can see, the chrome is compromised. (perplexed) Putting chrome on a prybar is not a good example of functionality.\nANGELA: (shrugs) Maybe it was decorative.\nHODGINS: (looking at the magnification on a video monitor.) Those're blood flecks.\nBRENNAN: From the victim?\nHODGINS: We have no way of knowing until DNA tests is done.\nZACK: The blood flecks begin approximately 25% of the way up the handle.\nBRENNAN: What does that indicate?\nZACK: I have absolutely no idea.\nANGELA: Oh, come on! Choke? (off the dumbfounded looks from HODGINS, ZACK, and BRENNAN.) Didn't anybody play softball or baseball? (ZACK shakes his head no.) Okay. (She picks up a similar prybar, and demonstrates the grip by holding the bar first by its handle, then by moving her grip upwards.) It's a choke-up.\nHODGINS: (catching on) For somebody not strong enough to swing the entire length of the bat, of course! It's a choke-up.\n(BRENNAN continues to look lost.)\nZACK: (using the English-to-Brennan dictionary) To forshorten the fulcrum.\nBRENNAN: Yes, I see, because the murderer was weaker than the full-grown male human for whom the prybar was designed.\nANGELA: Right, like a girl. Now, when I batted, I always had to choke up.And of course, I kicked ass. (She grins.)\nHODGINS: Sweet.\nBRENNAN: I'll have Cam check the DNA. (BRENNAN turns and leaves, to the accompaniment of a kicky musical sting.)\n(BRENNAN's office. We pan in from behind BRENNAN's tropical fish tank, to see BRENNAN sitting at a table. APRIL walks in.)\nAPRIL: Excuse me. Temperance?\nBRENNAN: April, hi.\nAPRIL: I, uh...wanted to talk to you, woman to woman, if that's possible.\nBRENNAN: It is possible, because we are both women.\nAPRIL: (smiles slowly, then sits down at the table. She then stands back up.) Seeing you the other night, it made me realize that you have a very objective eye.\nBRENNAN: Thank you.\nAPRIL: And you got to see Lance and me together, and I wonder if--if you might tell me what you think.\nBRENNAN: Could you be more specific in the question?\nAPRIL: Oh. (sits down, breaths in heavily, then exhales.) Fish. Fish choose their mates based primarily on color gradations. Two gouramis, for example, one male and one female? They'll mate if they're both vibrant blue. Now, if the male becomes paler, which can happen over the course of time, the female becomes nonreceptive to the male, even aggressive--do you see where I'm going with this?\nBRENNAN: Sweets is too pale.\nAPRIL: Yes. But let's say young, instead of pale, and go with that.\nBRENNAN: Is there an age difference?\nAPRIL: (scoffs) Yeah. I'm almost 27, and Lance just turned 23. (pauses) What's the age difference between you and Booth?\nBRENNAN: Ah, five years, but no, we are not blue fish.\nAPRIL: (gets it, and nods.) But still. He's very firm once you get him out of that suit, but ...\nBRENNAN: A pale blue.\nAPRIL: Robin's-egg, really. (on the verge of tears)...And I'm a vibrant, vibrant cobalt.(pulling it together) Not literally, I mean, we're both mostly pink, in reality.\nBRENNAN: No, I understand.\nAPRIL: (back to verging on tears, querulously) Did we seem good together to you?\nBRENNAN: April, it was--only one evening.\nAPRIL: (nods)\nCAM: (leans in the door of BRENNAN's OFFICE) We got the DNA results from the murder weapon.\nBRENNAN: (to CAM) s*x?\nAPRIL: (tearily) Oh, it was much more than adequate, it was wonderful, really. (APRIL sniffs. Closeup on CAM's hilarious \"WTF?\" face, and CAM walks into the room.) I mean, he's a nighttime person and I'm most...enthusiastic in the morning, but that's not the problem. (CAM is right next to APRIL before she notices.APRIL looks up, and CAM gives her a cheshire-cat smile.) Oh.Sorry! You're--you're talking about work. (She makes a \"locked-up-my-mouth-and-threw-away-the-key\" gesture.)\nCAM: DNA says the murderer's female. (Stunned, BRENNAN opens the file folder.)\n(FBI Interrogation Room. BOOTH and BRENNAN are questioning SMALLS and PHILIPPA.)\nSMALLS:(v.o.) Excuse me, we're here about a mud bath?\nBOOTH: No, we got a sworn statement here from Garth Jodrey that Philippa Fitz took him to the mud hole three years ago.\nBRENNAN: To have s*x.\nBOOTH: The same mudhole that Tripp was dumped in.\nPHILIPPA: I could give you a sworn statement that Garth took me to that mud hole.\nBOOTH: Oho, I slid that one right by her.\nPHILIPPA: What?\nSMALLS: You just admitted that you had prior knowledge to the location of a mud hole.\nBRENNAN: No changies.\nBOOTH: No takebacks.\nSMALLS: Answer nothing without prior confirmation from me.\nBOOTH: You killed Tripp because your father was about to sign the company over to him.\nPHILIPPA: What?\nSMALLS: Don't respond in any way.\nBOOTH: We have DNA evidence that shows that you swung the prybar into Tripp's head.\nSMALLS: According to the forensic report, the sample was very small, and was totally used up during the course of the test.\nBRENNAN: It's an accurate test.\nSMALLS: But it can't be repeated. And my client has a twin brother. Juries hate DNA evidence and twins. What's that sound? I believe that's reasonable doubt startin' its engines.\nBRENNAN: We have evidence that the same prybar was used to sabotage Tripp's motorcycle.\nSMALLS: A common tool left in a semi-public area? In a situation that could have arisen from incompetence rather than sabotage.\nBOOTH: (to PHILIPPA) You sabotaged the bike to kill Tripp, but he signed the contract before he could ride the bike and die the way he was supposed to.\nBRENNAN: So, you killed him with a prybar, loaded him onto his own truck, and dumped him in the mud puddle.\nBOOTH: Everything was great until your brother rode the bike that you sabotaged.\nPHILIPPA: You don't ride someone else's bike; Danny knew that!\nSMALLS: Philippa...\nBRENNAN: You killed him. Accidentally, but you did kill him.\nPHILIPPA: I loved my brother...\nSMALLS: Don't speak, please. (to BRENNAN and BOOTH) Are we free to go, or would you like to waste some more of the taxpayers' money?\nBRENNAN: She did it!\nSMALLS: You may get a prosecutor to lay a murder charge, but a jury will never bring home this baby the way you want it to.\nBOOTH: You're right. But, I'm still gonna make the arrest.\nSMALLS: To what end? You can't win!\nBOOTH: We let everybody know what Philippa did, including her father.\nPHILIPPA: (sobs.)\nBRENNAN: (brings BOOTH a cup of coffee in the conference area of the lab.) I'm okay with what you did there.\nBOOTH: Mmm...yeah, thanks a million, Bones.\nBRENNAN: Don't get mad; I'm just saying that, I just like it better when we catch 'em, and they go to jail.\nBOOTH: Yeah, well, sometimes it can get messy, Bones, but the point is, it gets done.\nBRENNAN: This one started out in a bit of mud and ended in a bit of mud.\nBOOTH: (laughs) That's very damned poetic of you.\n(A moody guitar begins to play as SWEETS enters the conference area, looking all forlorn.)\nSWEETS: Oh, hey guys. I didn't know you'd be here.\nBOOTH: Whaddya think, Bones?\nBRENNAN: He's lying. (to SWEETS) Do you wanna sit down?\nSWEETS: (shakes his head no.) Not really.\nBOOTH: Lying again.\nBRENNAN: (gestures with her head that he should join them.) C'mon. Sit down.\nSWEETS: Okay.\nBOOTH: April dump you?\nBRENNAN: How did you know that?\nBOOTH: He's got that \"dump-ee\" look on his face.\nSWEETS: (sighs) I'm a trained psychologist. I mean, I saw this coming; it's not like the signs eluded me. So I prepared myself mentally for it, and BOOTH: Hey, Sweets...Bones and I, we're going bowling tonight.\nBRENNAN: (playing along) Yes, yes, bowling. You know what, you wanna come? To go bowling with us at the bowling rink?\nBOOTH: Alley.\nBRENNAN: Bowling alley. The bowling alley.\nSWEETS: You know, fish aren't actually sentient. There's a reason people say \"cold as a fish.\" (BOOTH and BRENNAN nod sympathetically.) Me? I'm a dog person. I think that has meaning. Don't you?\nBRENNAN: Sure...\nSWEETS: (in little-boy voice) Do you think April was pretty?\nBRENNAN (looks to BOOTH for what she should say; he shakes his head no.) Not at all.\nSWEETS: You're lying, Dr. Brennan. I appreciate the effort; thank you.\nBOOTH: (grabs the back of SWEETS's rolling chair.) Come on, Sweets, whaddya say we go bowling? (to BRENNAN as he drags SWEETS's chair out of there.) I got him, c'mon!\nSWEETS: (over BOOTH) Nah, that's alright...\nBOOTH: C'mon!\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

That's how much time I had. I thought we were gonna die on that van.\nRORY: It seemed a good possibility.\nLORELAI: Ugh, that van ride felt longer than our train ride from Paris to Prague, and we had that group of French boys singing Sk8er Boi and smelling like a soccer field sitting all around us.\n[Babette comes out of her house and rushes over to them]\nBABETTE: Oh my God, you're back! Morey, they're back! Are you hurt? Are you bleeding?\nLORELAI: Oh, we're fine.\nBABETTE: You're fine? They're fine! Morey!\nMOREY: [opens his front door] Yeah?\nBABETTE: They're fine!\nMOREY: Okay. [goes back inside]\nBABETTE: What the hell happened to you two? According to the itinerary that Rory gave me, you were supposed to be home on Saturday.\nLORELAI: The itinerary that Rory gave you?\nBABETTE: So when you girls didn't show up, we panicked! Morey?\nMOREY: [opens front door] Yeah?\nBABETTE: Didn't we panic?\nMOREY: Yeah. [goes inside]\nLORELAI: Hey, Morey, you ever thought about just staying out here at times like these?\nBABETTE: By Sunday night, I was a complete basketcase. I thought you'd been kidnapped by some crazy Sandinistas or something.\nLORELAI: 'Cause the Sandinista movement is so popular in France.\nBABETTE: So, finally, I just started calling consulates.\nRORY: Consulates?\nLORELAI: How many consulates?\nBABETTE: Ah, jeez, all of 'em. Anyhow, you're here. Let's go inside, I wanna hear all about Europe. Morey, I'm going in!\nMOREY: [calls from his house] Okay.\n[Babette goes into Lorelai's house]\nLORELAI: You gave her an itinerary?\nRORY: I thought it would be good for someone to know where we were.\nLORELAI: Oh, you gave her an itinerary and she called every consulate in the world.\nRORY: If we were caught smuggling hash over the border and we were thrown in some Turkish prison, wouldn't you want someone to know that we were in Turkey?\nLORELAI: Where'd we get this hash we were smuggling?\nRORY: You were at a café, you met a guy, he was sweet-talking you, he put the stuff in your purse when you weren't looking.\nLORELAI: At least tell me he was cute.\nRORY: He was not bad for a hash dealer.\nLORELAI: Hm.\n[they walk into the house]\nBABETTE: [calls from the kitchen] I'm making cocoa!\nLORELAI: She's making cocoa 'cause you gave her an itinerary.\nRORY: I may have given her the itinerary, but you're the one who got us busted for drug smuggling.\nLORELAI: Reality has absolutely no place in our world.\n[they walk to the kitchen]\nBABETTE: Okay, I wanna hear all about Europe. Come on, tell me, what'd you see?\nLORELAI: Well, everything. Uh, Notre Dame, the Roman Baths, St. Peter's Basilica.\nRORY: Mom touched the Pope.\nBABETTE: You're kidding!\nLORELAI: Actually, I just touched his car. Then one of the Swiss guards in the fruity cool clothing busted me.\nRORY: Luckily, Mom's fluent in flirting.\nLORELAI: And flirting with a guy in a pompom hat and a skirt is quite an accomplishment.\nBABETTE: Well, it sounds like you had a terrific trip.\nRORY: It was. [Lorelai signals for her to fake a yawn, and Rory does]\nLORELAI: Aw, are you okay, hon?\nRORY: Yeah, I'm just a little sleepy.\nBABETTE: Aw, of course, you girls must be wiped. I'll, uh, get out of here.\nLORELAI: Oh, but thanks, Babette.\nBABETTE: Well, goodnight, sleep tight. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Morey, I'm coming home! [leaves]\nRORY: I'm gonna go unpack.\nLORELAI: Oh, unpack tomorrow.\nRORY: No, if I leave stuff packed overnight, everything's gonna get gross.\nLORELAI: Everything's already gross.\n[they walk into Rory's bedroom]\nRORY: Ahhh.\n[Rory walks to the closet as Lorelai gets on the bed]\nLORELAI: Oh my God, your bed feels good.\nRORY: Do not get comfortable. I will sleep on top of you if I have to.\nLORELAI: Oh man, smell this. [holds up a pillow]\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: I forgot that pillows don't have to smell like feet. You know, I have to say, I think it's good I did this hostel thing in my thirties, and I'll tell you why.\nRORY: [hugging the clothes in her closet] I missed you, I missed you all!\nLORELAI: If I had done it in my twenties or teens, I would've been naïve enough to think that hostels were exotic and romantic. But once you're in your thirties, you've lived enough to know they're gross and should be avoided at all costs.\nRORY: [to her clothes] I had a dream about you in Copenhagen. You were there, and you, and you, and you.\nLORELAI: Listen, since we slept on the plane, we should go to sleep now, but get up really early tomorrow. We don't wanna blow this whole week being jet-lagged. We need to establish normal sleeping patterns.\nRORY: Fine.\nLORELAI: Okay. I'm gonna go take a shower and leave you alone to make out with your sock drawer.\nRORY: Close the door.\n[Lorelai leaves. Rory pulls open her sock drawer]\nRORY: Hello, boys.\n[opening credits]\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Rory is organizing the souvenirs in the living room. Lorelai walks down the steps talking on the phone]\nLORELAI: [on phone] Gilmore, Lorelai, yes. My daughter's name is Lorelai also. Well, very confusing or, in your case, extremely convenient. Uh, no, see, we were never missing, it was a big mistake.\nRORY: Who are you talking to?\nLORELAI: Belgium.\nRORY: Ah.\nLORELAI: [on phone] Yes, uh huh, Babette Dell. She got our arrival dates mixed up and she was just worried, but we're fine, we're here. We just loved your fries. Okay, sure, bye bye. [hangs up] Okay, Belgium's done, Lisbon's calling me back, Berlin had no idea what I was talking about, and Paris is pissed.\nRORY: At who?\nLORELAI: Ugh, who knows? Okay, I'm taking a break and then I'm taking on the Netherlands. I still cannot believe Babette did this.\nRORY: She just loves us.\nLORELAI: Well, be a little less lovable, would you, 'cause it's costing me a fortune. Try being one of those kids where people are like, \"Oh really, she was kidnapped? Hey, well, thin the herd.\"\nRORY: Very nice. Hey, who are the rosary beads for?\nLORELAI: They're mine.\nRORY: What do you need rosary beads for?\nLORELAI: They're cute.\nRORY: They're for prayer.\nLORELAI: Well, pray they match my blue suit?\nRORY: They have just upgraded you to a queen-size bed, Jacuzzi tub, junior suite in hell.\nLORELAI: Hm. Oh, Pieta placemat?\nRORY: Oh, Gypsy.\nLORELAI: How are you feeling?\nRORY: You know, not bad. Just a little spacy.\nLORELAI: Like a cold medicine buzz?\nRORY: Maybe we got lucky and missed the jet lag.\nLORELAI: I hope so because we have a very big week ahead of us.\nRORY: Oh yeah?\nLORELAI: Yes. In fact, I have here in my hand a schedule of all the activities we are going to partake in over this week, the final week of Rory Gilmore's life before she enters the ivy-covered hallowed halls of Yale University.\nRORY: Schedule, please.\nLORELAI: Okay. Today we get these presents out to our friends and then we hit the mall.\nRORY: Got it.\nLORELAI: Tomorrow we get an early start and we hit three of the crappier movies that are out.\nRORY: And then we have dinner at Grandma's.\nLORELAI: Which I will conveniently not put down on my list in the hopes that that magically goes away. Uh, okay, the next day we hit New York, see your fancy art galleries, hit the Strand.\nRORY: Yes!\nLORELAI: Pizza at John's. Um, Sunday, pick up all the stuff you need for school, and then there's a barbecue at Sookie's. Monday is mani/pedi, facial, haircut, go to the psychic, and stock up for Tuesday, the day of all days - Godfather I, II, and III, with extra showings of the Sofia death scene over and over as long as the Mallomars hold out.\nRORY: The perfect day!\nLORELAI: I agree.\nRORY: And I think we have just enough of the biscotti that we brought back from Milan to last us the rest of the week.\nLORELAI: Oh, good. Well, everything's in order, so, uh, let's get going and get this stuff out of here.\nRORY: Okay.\nLORELAI: Wow, we sure have a lot of gifts. Do we like this many people?\nRORY: I didn't think so. Maybe we're getting soft in our old age.\nLORELAI: Okay, well, I guess we should get some tote bags.\nRORY: What tote bags?\nLORELAI: We must have tote bags.\nRORY: Where would we get tote bags?\nLORELAI: Excuse me, every woman who's ever purchased seventy-five dollars worth of Clinique products has some tote bags.\nRORY: We don't have tote bags.\nLORELAI: Well, how are we supposed to get this stuff out of here?\nCUT TO SIDEWALK\n[Lorelai and Rory walk down the street wearing their backpacks]\nLORELAI: Now we're the quirky backpack ladies.\nRORY: One of the kinder nicknames that have been attributed to us.\nLORELAI: Let's just be very efficient about this. Okay, we'll start with Patty, work our way clockwise around the town, end with Andrew. And let's stick with the 'my mom touched the Pope' anecdote. It's quick, it's peppy, and everybody likes a nice Pope story.\nRORY: Do we have time to stop at Luke's? I'm starving.\nLORELAI: Absolutely. This is our week, this week we do anything we want.\nRORY: I like this week.\nLORELAI: Hey, I wonder if Luke and Nicole actually went on that cruise.\nRORY: I thought he was going.\nLORELAI: Yeah, I know, but I wonder if he actually went.\nRORY: Why wouldn't he?\nLORELAI: Well, I don't know. Because he'd have to pack and leave, plus he'd have to buy a bathing suit.\nRORY: Well, I hope he went. He could use a good vacation. Plus, he really seems to like Nicole.\nLORELAI: Mmhmm. Yeah, he does. Oh, hey, looks like the soda shop is open.\nRORY: Oh, cool.\n[They stop outside the soda shop and see Luke and Taylor arguing inside]\nLUKE: I am gonna kill you.\nTAYLOR: Oh, please, you are not.\nLUKE: I am, too. I'm gonna kill you. I should've killed you before. I should've killed you the minute you put up those unicorn topiaries in the park, but, hey, hindsight, right?\nRORY: Aw, I've missed that.\nLORELAI: What do you think, biscotti moment?\nRORY: Absolutely.\n[Lorelai and Rory eat biscotti while they watch Luke and Taylor argue]\nTAYLOR: You don't have to yell, Luke.\nLUKE: You put a giant window in my wall.\nTAYLOR: So what?\nLUKE: A giant window! Right here! You can see my entire diner. And when I'm in my diner, I can see your whole stupid store.\nTAYLOR: I don't understand why yours is a diner and mine is a stupid store.\nLUKE: Look at this place! Look at you. All you need is six dancing penguins and Mary Poppins floating in the corner to bring back two of the worst hours of my childhood.\nTAYLOR: I don't think you had a childhood. I think you came out a bitter surly killjoy.\nLUKE: You can't change the basic structure of this place without my okay! What?\nTAYLOR: Your hand is near the wax lips.\nLUKE: So?\nTAYLOR: If you could just move it so you don't accidentally touch the candy. Lucas. [Luke rummages through the different boxes of candy] What are you doing? You stop that right now!\nLUKE: [throws candy in the air] Look at all the pretty candy!\nTAYLOR: Agh, stop it right now!\nLORELAI: [gasps] Oh my God!\nRORY: Hm, what? What's the matter?\nLORELAI: Luke.\nRORY: Yeah, he's finally lost it.\nLORELAI: No, we forgot Luke.\nRORY: We forgot Luke what? Oh, we forgot to bring him back a gift. Oh no!\nLORELAI: We kept putting it off and putting it off.\nRORY: We couldn't find anything good enough.\nLORELAI: We should've gotten him that bullfighter's uniform.\nRORY: Well, so what do we do?\nLORELAI: Well, we have to just pick up something here and we'll tell him that we got it in Denmark.\nRORY: Pick up what?\nLORELAI: Something.\nRORY: What? This is Stars Hollow. Everything you buy here has a Hello, Kitty stamped on the bottom.\nLORELAI: Well, we have to get him something. We cannot go into Luke's empty handed.\nRORY: Great.\nLORELAI: Come on.\nRORY: I'm hungry.\nCUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE\n[Lorelai and Rory walk up to the house]\nLORELAI: Hey, Sookie!\n[Sookie rushes off the porch to greet them]\nSOOKIE: [squeals] You're back!\nLORELAI: We're back!\n[they all hug; Jackson comes out of the house]\nJACKSON: Hey, don't squish baby!\nSOOKIE: I missed you so much!\nLORELAI: We missed you so much.\nSOOKIE: Ah, look at you! You look older.\nRORY: Oh, thanks, Sookie.\nSOOKIE: So how was it, was it wonderful?\nLORELAI: Oh -\nSOOKIE: I wanna hear everything you did and everything you ate. Oh, was it warm? I read it was warm. How was Barcelona? Did you see the gaudy apartments? Ooh, did you see a bullfight? Did you see Anne Frank's house? Did you cry? Was Steven Speilberg there, huh? Oh, hey, I hear you touched the Pope! Are you hungry? Do you want anything to eat? I've got quiche.\n[they walk into the house]\nLORELAI: Hold on one sec here, missy. I need to look at you. Sideways, please.\nSOOKIE: Okay.\nLORELAI: Hello, hi, nice to see you. I'm your Auntie Lorelai, and this is your Auntie Rory. Say hi, Rory.\nRORY: Hey.\nLORELAI: Come over here.\nRORY: Oh, no, I'm good.\nSOOKIE: Come on, Rory, rub my stomach.\nRORY: I'd rather not.\nLORELAI: Rory's a chicken.\nSOOKIE: So is Jackson.\nJACKSON: Hey, I'm gonna like it when it comes out.\nLORELAI: So what did the ultrasound say, boy or girl?\nSOOKIE: It's a -\nJACKSON: Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.\nLORELAI: It's a buh? What's a buh?\nJACKSON: [reveals a button pinned to his shirt] Read.\nLORELAI: [reads button] \"I do not want to know the s*x of my baby.\"\nJACKSON: That's right. I'm going old school on this.\nSOOKIE: And he's being completely stubborn.\nRORY: But you know?\nSOOKIE: Of course I know. I had little clothes to buy -\nJACKSON: Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh!\nSOOKIE: What? I said nothing about the s*x.\nJACKSON: You said little, and now I know it's going to be little.\nLORELAI: Jackson, seriously, you don't wanna know?\nJACKSON: Hey, in the old days, the guys would pace back and forth in the waiting room until a pretty nurse in a nice white outfit would come out and say, \"Congratulations - it's a 'insert your chosen s*x here'.\" Ricky Ricardo didn't know, Dick van Dyke didn't know, and by gum, if it was good enough for Rick and Dick, it's good enough for me.\nLORELAI: Well, I wanna know.\nJACKSON: Rory, what do you say? Be on my side.\nSOOKIE: Jackson, there are no sides.\nJACKSON: We can be in that waiting room together, pacing, waiting, we'll get you a nice suit. What do you say?\nRORY: Okay, sure. I'm on Jackson's side.\nJACKSON: Great. Welcome to 1954. [gives her a button]\nRORY: Happy to be here.\nLORELAI: Well, I wanna know.\nSOOKIE: Come on, I'll tell you outside.\nLORELAI: Sure you don't wanna go?\nRORY: Read the button, missy.\nLORELAI: Okay.\n[Lorelai and Sookie leave]\nRORY: So, you hear about that whole Sputnik thing?\nJACKSON: Oh, Eisenhower's on top of it.\nRORY: Hm.\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Lorelai and Sookie walk out back to the shed]\nLORELAI: So Jackson's really not gonna be in the delivery room with you?\nSOOKIE: Nope.\nLORELAI: Does that bug you?\nSOOKIE: Hey, I don't like Jackson to see me shave my legs, so. . .I'm opening the shed! Okay, are you ready?\nLORELAI: For what?\n[Sookie opens the shed; it's filled with blue baby products]\nLORELAI: [gasps] It's a boy!\nSOOKIE: It's a boy!\nLORELAI: Oh, Sookie, you're having a boy!\nSOOKIE: I know! Jackson will finally have that son to prune the trees with.\nLORELAI: My God, it's so exciting. A boy! Oh, a little boy. I know nothing about little boys.\nSOOKIE: Me neither.\nLORELAI: Man, you're prepared, aren't you?\nSOOKIE: Yes, I am.\n[They sit down in chairs in the shed]\nLORELAI: It's so nice to be home.\nSOOKIE: It's nice to have you home.\nLORELAI: Hey, have you seen Luke lately?\nSOOKIE: Briefly.\nLORELAI: I guess he went on that cruise, huh?\nSOOKIE: Yup.\nLORELAI: That's good. That's good he went. He needed a vacation. He works hard, that one. Always cooking, making the coffee, taking the orders.\nSOOKIE: You know, I think something happened on that trip of his.\nLORELAI: What do you mean?\nSOOKIE: Well, the day he got back, Jackson and I went into the diner and I asked him how his trip went. He couldn't get away from me fast enough.\nLORELAI: Really? Was Jackson wearing that creepy button?\nSOOKIE: Nope. Luke just seemed kind of freaked out about something.\nLORELAI: What?\nSOOKIE: I don't know.\nLORELAI: You think he and Nicole had a fight or something?\nSOOKIE: I don't know.\nLORELAI: He didn't say anything?\nSOOKIE: Nope. He just walked around acting weirder than normal.\nLORELAI: Huh. Wonder what that's all about. So. . . are you gonna name him Lorelai?\nSOOKIE: Absolutely. That wouldn't be confusing at all.\nLORELAI: Great.\nCUT TO SIDEWALK\n[Lorelai and Rory walk down the street. Lorelai is carrying a jar of jam.]\nRORY: I cannot believe you.\nLORELAI: What? It's the perfect gift for Luke. Fine fancy jam from France.\nRORY: Fine fancy jam from Jackson's pantry.\nLORELAI: I don't know what you're talking about. I am looking right here at this beautiful hand-crafted label and it says \"Fruits de la Terre.\"\nRORY: You didn't even spellcheck to make sure you got the French right.\nLORELAI: Yes, well, I think it adds an authentic touch. See, in my world, the person who made this jam was an illiterate orphan. . .Sochelle.\nRORY: As in Sochelle Crab.\nLORELAI: Yes, exactly. Sochelle was born by the sea, or so said the note left in the bassinet when the nuns found her on the steps of Notre Dame.\nRORY: Oh, good, there are nuns.\nLORELAI: Every sad story needs nuns. Anyhow, Sochelle had nothing - no father, no mother, no friends, no education. All she had was a burning desire to make great jam, and now she's the most successful jamstress in Paris.\nRORY: Luke's gonna know.\nLORELAI: No, he is not.\nRORY: Well, as much as I would like to be there when you give Luke your heartfelt gift, I'm gonna go give Lane her gift.\nLORELAI: All right, but if you're not there, I'm gonna get all the credit for this.\nRORY: Exactly as it should be.\nLORELAI: Give Lane a hug for me.\nRORY: I will. Don't give him the jam.\nLORELAI: I can't hear you, I'm too far away.\nCUT TO LUKE'S DINER\n[Lorelai walks in]\nLORELAI: Bonjour, Luke. Pouvez-vous attacher vos chausseurs?\nLUKE: What?\nLORELAI: Uh, hi, Luke. Do you know how to tie your shoes?\nLUKE: Very good.\nLORELAI: Yup. It came in handy, let me tell you. Not one shoelace fatality on my watch. [he sets a mug in front of her] You remembered.\nLUKE: Yup. A couple things about you stick. You have a good time?\nLORELAI: Vos odeurs de chat.\nLUKE: What's that?\nLORELAI: Your cat smells.\nLUKE: You must've been a big hit with the salon set.\nLORELAI: The trip was incredible, we had the best time. We were supposed to come back on Saturday.\nLUKE: I know.\nLORELAI: Keeping tabs on me?\nLUKE: Always safer to know which direction the tornado's coming from.\nLORELAI: Anyhow, we were in London and we ran into this group of girls who were heading to Ireland to stake out the Clarence Hotel.\nLUKE: Why?\nLORELAI: Because U2 owns it and Bono hangs out there.\nLUKE: Ah. Him again.\nLORELAI: So then we jumped on a train and we headed to Ireland - incredibly beautiful, by the way - and we sat in a bar for two days and did nothing but eat soda crackers and funky cheese and he never showed.\nLUKE: Que sera.\nLORELAI: Hm. [sips her coffee] Mm, still good. I told 'em about you over there, Señor Swanky-pants.\nLUKE: Can't tell you how grateful I am to have you as my press agent.\nLORELAI: And we got you something.\nLUKE: You did?\nLORELAI: Yes, we did.\nLUKE: You didn't have to do that.\nLORELAI: What are you talking about? We do not go to Europe and come back without bringing something for Luke. Here. [hands Luke the jar of jam]\nLUKE: Jam.\nLORELAI: Yes, fancy French jam.\nLUKE: Fruits de la Terre. Very impressive.\nLORELAI: It's handmade by this woman in Paris who has the most amazing story.\nLUKE: Really?\nLORELAI: Yeah. Orphaned.\nLUKE: Uh huh.\nLORELAI: And illiterate.\nLUKE: Okay.\nLORELAI: Just had nothing in her life, you know, except this burning desire to be the world's greatest jamstress. And she's famous now and, uh, you know, she only makes three bottles of that stuff a year and that's one of 'em, and I brought it all the way across the, uh. . .I got it from Sookie's house.\nLUKE: No.\nLORELAI: How did you know?\nLUKE: Just a wild guess.\nLORELAI: I swear, we tried to get you something, but nothing was good enough.\nLUKE: No, forget it. I didn't get you anything on my trip either. We're even.\nLORELAI: Oh, yeah, how was the cruise?\nLUKE: Oh, it was. . .you know.\nLORELAI: Not really, I've never been on a cruise. So. . .\nLUKE: It was fine.\nLORELAI: Okay. So, you and Nicole had fun then?\nLUKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You want more coffee?\nLORELAI: Uh, eh, oh. So what did you?\nLUKE: Where?\nLORELAI: On the boat? What did you and Nicole do on the boat?\nLUKE: Oh, uh, you know, we fluttered around and ate, and there was a magic show and a singer and pillow mints, and you know, that's it.\nLORELAI: But you and Nicole had a good time, you got along, and. . .\nLUKE: Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna go check on your food.\nLORELAI: Okay. [Luke walks away] I didn't order anything yet.\nCUT TO SIDEWALK\n[Kirk is hanging up a poster in front of the market as Rory walks by]\nRORY: Hi, Kirk.\nKIRK: Bienvenido, señora Gilmore.\n[Rory sees that her picture is on the poster, promoting her as the Ice Cream Queen. She tears it down and walks away]\nKIRK: What are you doing? I just put that there.\nCUT TO TAYLOR'S SODA SHOP\n[Taylor is instructing the employees on how to serve the ice cream]\nTAYLOR: Scoop toward you, rolling smoothly. Very good, Ginger. Nice symmetrical balls there, Joshua. Easy on the nuts, easy on the nuts. One cherry, and then present your sundae with a Taylor Tip.\n[Rory walks in carrying the poster]\nRORY: Uh, excuse me, Taylor.\nTAYLOR: Ah, there you are. Hello, your majesty. Come to check on your little kingdom? Uh, Ginger, hand me a spoon.\nRORY: I was just walking by when I -\nTAYLOR: Here you are, on the house. [hands her a dish of ice cream]\nRORY: Thank you.\nTAYLOR: Would you like an extra cherry?\nRORY: No.\nTAYLOR: Because if the Stars Hollow Ice Cream Queen wants two cherries, then she will get two cherries, and to hell with the extra twenty-five cent charge.\nRORY: Taylor, you didn't ask me if I wanted to be the Ice Cream Queen.\nTAYLOR: So?\nRORY: So, you didn't ask me. You just put my picture on a flier and stuck it up all over town.\nTAYLOR: Well, I couldn't very well ask you when you were traipsing all over Europe, now could I?\nRORY: But -\nTAYLOR: And don't worry about getting anything. I have already rented a cape and a crown. Just wear a nice simple sage-colored floor-length dress and you'll be fine.\nRORY: I can't do it.\nTAYLOR: What do you mean, you can't do it?\nRORY: I mean, I'm busy right now. I only have a couple days left before I go off to school, and my mom and I have every moment planned, so I'm just going to have to pass on this one.\nTAYLOR: Oh, I see. You're going to pass. You're passing on this. Fine. Just consider yourself passed.\nRORY: Look, I can still come by.\nTAYLOR: Oh, can you, really? You can find time in your busy day to come by and eat my free ice cream and take my free balloon and get yourself a free glitter hand stamp? You can swing that? You don't have to pass on that, huh?\nRORY: Look, Taylor, don't take it like this.\nTAYLOR: In my own defense, I assumed you would be thrilled based on your, uh, past participation record.\nRORY: But this has nothing to do with -\nTAYLOR: You've always been the head pilgrim girl at the food drive table.\nRORY: Yes, well, that's for charity.\nTAYLOR: The third leprechaun at the St. Patty's Day festival.\nRORY: Yes, okay, but again, for charity.\nTAYLOR: You man the ticket booth on Groundhog Day. You help organize the manger procession at Christmas, you play Esther every year at the Purim carnival. I just assumed you liked taking part in town events.\nRORY: I do like it, but I just can't this time. I'm sorry.\nTAYLOR: Oh, don't be. It's my own fault. I should have figured that once you got into Yale everything would be different.\nRORY: That's not fair.\nTAYLOR: No, I understand. You're no longer our little Stars Hollow Rory Gilmore. You belong to the Ivy Leagues right now. It's time to cut those small town ties and go off and do something important like go to drama school or have one of those high-class naked parties with that Bush girl.\nRORY: Taylor -\nTAYLOR: Okay. See you around the quad. [walks away]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Lorelai and Rory walk through the front door]\nLORELAI: Okay, that took way longer than it was supposed to. From now on, when we go out of town, no presents for anyone.\nRORY: Oh, right. So we'll just buy everyone a big crate of Fruits de la Terre.\nLORELAI: That horse is dead, put the stick down. Now we're way behind in our schedule, so I propose a change. Let's hold off on the frivolous shopping until tomorrow. What's up?\nRORY: That Taylor thing is still bugging me.\nLORELAI: Me, too. I can't believe you didn't call me in to see the fight.\nRORY: Maybe I am different. Maybe I do have an attitude.\nLORELAI: I think you do.\nRORY: I mean, I've always had time for the town in the past, and now suddenly I don't? Am I changing? I don't wanna change. I don't wanna be the anti-town girl. I'm not Daria.\nLORELAI: Taylor is just messing with your mind, which is one of his specialties. Ignore him.\nRORY: I guess. [she picks up a pile of mail from the coffee table.]\nLORELAI: Hey, hey, no mail yet. We agreed, we're still on vacation.\nRORY: Well, I'll just look through my mail. Yours can sit there as long as you like.\nLORELAI: Yeah, but then you're back in the real world again and I'm out here in vacation-land alone. That's not fun.\nRORY: [reading a letter] Oh no.\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: Oh no.\nLORELAI: What oh no?\n[Rory heads to her bedroom, Lorelai follows]\nRORY: Oh no. Oh no. No no no no no no no no no. Oh no.\nLORELAI: Uh, hey, kid, you're kind of freaking me out here.\n[Rory flips through her date book]\nRORY: I wrote the date down wrong.\nLORELAI: What date?\nRORY: This is from Yale. My orientation is Saturday.\nLORELAI: Right, next Saturday.\nRORY: No, this Saturday.\nLORELAI: No, next Saturday.\nRORY: No, this Saturday.\nLORELAI: But today's Thursday. That means we have no -\nRORY: I have to be at school the day after tomorrow.\nLORELAI: But. . .no! We had a free week. I had it all scheduled out.\nRORY: Well, I wrote the date down wrong.\nLORELAI: Why would you do that?\nRORY: I don't know.\nLORELAI: You never write the date down wrong.\nRORY: Well, I wrote it down before we left and I wrote it down wrong.\nLORELAI: We were supposed to have a week.\nRORY: Well, we don't.\nLORELAI: I can't believe you wrote the date down wrong.\nRORY: I can't believe you weren't gonna let me open the mail.\nLORELAI: I can't believe you wrote the date down wrong.\nRORY: I can't believe you made us go to Ireland to stalk Bono.\nLORELAI: This isn't fair. You have more I-can't-believe's than I do.\nRORY: This sucks.\nLORELAI: This totally sucks.\nRORY: Well, I'm not ready. I haven't packed. I have things I need to get. We were supposed to watch the three Godfather's and Sofia dying over and over and eat our biscotti and -\nLORELAI: Okay, listen, calm down. We just need to revise our plan.\nRORY: We were supposed to have a week.\nLORELAI: Okay, tonight we stay home and pack. Tomorrow we get up early. We'll get all the stuff you need, and that will give us time to watch at least two Godfather's and a Sofia dying. We'll still have a partial day and a great biscotti night.\nRORY: Chinese.\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: Food. Order it. Go.\nLORELAI: No, no time for full sentences!\nRORY: Right.\nLORELAI: Ordering!\nCUT TO SIDEWALK\n[Lorelai and Rory, each carrying several shopping bags, walk through the town square]\nLORELAI: I'm so wiped. I shouldn't have taken that third Excedrin PM last night.\nRORY: Third? Why'd you take three?\nLORELAI: Oh, well, uh, originally I took two, then somewhere around four in the morning, I woke up and had a major Marilyn moment.\nRORY: Oh, no.\nLORELAI: Yeah. I forgot that I'd taken something and so I popped a third one and now I'm about ready to sleep with a Kennedy.\nRORY: Well, I hear Kerry's available.\nLORELAI: Okay, let's sit. God, Mr. Jet Lag wants to be my best friend.\nRORY: Well, do you wanna go home and rest?\nLORELAI: No. We have a Godfather night to salvage. Check the list.\nRORY: Okay, we got the sheets, towels, bathroom shower caddy, and the basic first aid accoutrement. We still need to hit the beauty supply, the hardware store, stationery store.\nLORELAI: The mattress store.\nRORY: You do know that they supply you with a mattress at the dorm.\nLORELAI: Yeah. A mattress that decades of students in various states of cleanliness have slept on. Some without pajamas.\nRORY: Gross.\nLORELAI: Exactly.\nRORY: We've been running around for hours and this list isn't getting any shorter. We're never gonna finish.\nLORELAI: Stop. Yes, we are. We just need to split up. We'll get all this done quicker. I'll take the, uh, beauty supply and you take the stationery store, and we'll meet back here in twenty minutes.\nRORY: Okay. Oh, boy.\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: Well, I'm gonna walk right past that stupid grand opening.\nLORELAI: Well, I would take the stationery store, but you're so weird about what kind of pens you like.\nRORY: No, no. I'll just. . .I'll walk really fast. Maybe Taylor won't notice me.\nLORELAI: Yeah. You better walk really fast, like warp speed Mr. Sulu kind of fast.\nRORY: Let's go.\nLORELAI: Twenty minutes!\n[They go off in separate directions. Rory stops to listen to Taylor speaking to a crowd in front of the soda shop]\nTAYLOR: ...since these and many other flavors await your tongues at Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store. I wanna thank you all for coming here today to help us celebrate our grand opening. Now, originally we were supposed to have our Ice Cream Queen here, but unfortunately, kids, she was just too busy. She just couldn't find time in her busy queen schedule to come play with all of you here today.\n[a young girl in the crowd starts crying]\nTAYLOR: I know, Christy, but take heart, we still have balloons and music, and as a special treat a little later, a skydiver is going to drop from the sky and land right here in front of Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store. Isn't that great, kids? A skydiver who isn't too busy to come play with you will be here soon.\nCUT TO THE BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE\n[Lorelai walks in]\nLORELAI: Hey, Kirk.\nKIRK: Hello.\nLORELAI: Hey, I'm looking for a good daytime cream and a good nighttime cream.\nKIRK: For you?\nLORELAI: No, for Rory.\nKIRK: Is she sensitive, prone to breakouts if the cream is too heavy?\nLORELAI: Yeah.\nKIRK: I thought so. Okay, first of all, I would stay far away from that one.\nLORELAI: Oh.\nKIRK: Much too rich for her. This one is light with a fresh citrus scent and it is completely natural.\nLORELAI: We like that.\nKIRK: Now, for day, I would recommend something with a sunscreen. Rory has a classic peaches and cream complexion, and it would be a crime if, when she got older, her face started to look like a cowboy.\nLORELAI: I couldn't agree more.\nKIRK: All right. This should work.\nLORELAI: Thank you.\nKIRK: You know, I heard you got back from your trip.\nLORELAI: Yup, I'm living proof.\nKIRK: Miss Patty showed me the castanets you brought her.\nLORELAI: Oh yeah?\nKIRK: Yeah. And Andrew showed me the T-shirt from the Picasso museum. I must admit, I was a little jealous. I mean, I hate Picasso, but I love T-shirts.\nLORELAI: Oh.\nKIRK: And Pete seemed to really enjoy the Tower of London nutcracker you brought him.\nLORELAI: Kirk.\nKIRK: A nutcracker's a very useful thing to have around. I can't tell you how many times I've been sitting in my living room with a nut thinking, \"if only I had a way to crack this.\"\nLORELAI: Okay, Kirk, I'm really sorry, we got a little messed up on the presents. It just got so crazy over there. I mean, we forgot to bring something back for Luke.\nKIRK: I heard he got jam.\nLORELAI: Fake jam.\nKIRK: I love fake jam.\nLORELAI: You know what, I'm gonna make this up to you, okay?\nKIRK: Really?\nLORELAI: I promise. We never meant to forget you.\nKIRK: Oh. Okay, well, sure. You can make it up to me.\nLORELAI: Okay. Now how much do I owe you?\nKIRK: 45.50. You're, uh, you're lucky you came in when you did. I'm closing a little early today.\nLORELAI: Ooh, well, lucky me.\nKIRK: Yup. [he puts on a skydiver's backpack]\nLORELAI: Kirk, no.\nKIRK: Taylor paid me twenty dollars to jump out of a plane for the grand opening.\nLORELAI: No.\nKIRK: But I took a lesson. The guy said I was a natural at falling.\nLORELAI: Kirk, listen to me, this is the best gift I could possibly give you - don't do that, okay?\nKIRK: Do I still get the jam?\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Rory is walking down the street. Two young kids walk by.]\nKID 1: Thanks a lot.\nKID 2: Yale can have you.\n[Lorelai walks up to Rory]\nLORELAI: Honey. Hey, did you get your silly pens?\nRORY: Yes.\nLORELAI: Okay, good. Now I can mark these two things off, and we only have about ten thousand other things to do.\nRORY: Great.\nLORELAI: You know, I think the only way we're gonna get this all done is if we prioritize.\nRORY: Meaning?\nLORELAI: Something has to go.\nRORY: Biscotti night.\nLORELAI: No, not biscotti night. I think we should bail on Friday night dinner.\nRORY: Cancel on Grandma?\nLORELAI: Yes, cancel on Grandma.\nRORY: I can't do that.\nLORELAI: Rory, we need to get this stuff before tomorrow. There's no way we can do that if we have to drive all the way to Hartford and back. She'll understand. Well, the first part was true.\nRORY: I can't skip dinner.\nLORELAI: Come on, we're gonna go to dinner next week and every week after that for the rest of our lives. And I do mean the rest of our lives because my parents will outlive us. The damned can do that.\nRORY: Mom, I made a deal. This is why I get to go to Yale. I can't back out.\nLORELAI: It's our last night.\nRORY: I have to go. You don't have to, but I do.\nLORELAI: What do you mean I don't have to go?\nRORY: I was very clear when I made this deal that it was only for me.\nLORELAI: You're right, I don't have to go. Boy, that's an oddly liberating feeling. I don't have to go. I don't have to go. I do not have to go to dinner.\nRORY: Mom.\nLORELAI: Hang on, I'm not done. I do not have to go ever if I'm not in the mood.\nRORY: Mom.\nLORELAI: I'm not going. I'll finish up all the errands.\nRORY: Really?\nLORELAI: Yes. You go and you eat really fast and then get out of there. Meet me back here 9:30, 10 at the latest, and we'll do Godfather I through \"Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,\" and a quick Sofia dying.\nRORY: Deal.\nLORELAI: Remember, eat fast.\nRORY: Okay.\nLORELAI: Okay.\nRORY: Bye.\n[They go off in separate directions. Taylor is still speaking to the crowd in front of the soda shop]\nTAYLOR: Now just picture her sitting here just like this, smiling and waving. 'Hello kids, I'm the Ice Cream Queen.'\n[Rory walks up to the microphone to speak to the crowd]\nRORY: Okay, that's it. I humiliate myself at least six times a year for this town, and just because I'm going to Yale, that's not going to stop. Now the reason I am not the Ice Cream Queen is because Taylor never asked me. I didn't know about it, and that's why I was busy. Now I love this town, I will be back in that ridiculous pilgrim outfit at Thanksgiving, so everybody just get off my back.\n[She walks away as some people applaud]\nCUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE\n[The doorbell rings. Emily walks toward the door]\nEMILY: Richard, they're here! Put those papers away and fix your tie.\n[Emily opens the door]\nRORY: Hey, Grandma.\nEMILY: Hello, Rory.\nRORY: Nice to see you.\nEMILY: It's nice to see you, too. Come on in.\nRORY: I'm sorry I'm a little late.\nEMILY: Well, you're here now and that's all that matters. Shall we go into the living room?\nRORY: Yes. Then I can give you your present.\nEMILY: My present? Well, that sounds very interesting.\nRORY: We bought it for you in Paris because Mom said you loved Paris the most.\nEMILY: I wonder what it could be.\n[They sit down in the living room. Rory hands her a gift]\nRORY: For you.\n[Emily opens the gift, an Eiffel Tower figurine]\nEMILY: Oh my, it's lovely, Rory, really. Just beautiful.\nRORY: It was between this and the Arc de Triumphe, but Mom said that the Eiffel Tower was fancier.\nEMILY: I agree, and I love it. Thank you.\nRORY: You're welcome.\nEMILY: So, where is your mother tonight? Not sick, I hope.\nRORY: Oh, no, she's fine. She just had some things to do.\nEMILY: Ah, things.\nRORY: Errands, actually.\nEMILY: Errands, of course.\nRORY: But she'll be here next week, and she says she's looking forward to it.\n[Richard walks into the room]\nRICHARD: Emily, I'm expecting a call and there's nothing I can do about it, so please don't be upset when I leave the table. Rory, how lovely to see you. Well, how was the first European excursion?\nRORY: It was perfect.\nEMILY: Lorelai had chores to do tonight.\nRICHARD: Chores?\nEMILY: Errands, you know.\nRICHARD: Errands?\nEMILY: Yes, that's why she didn't come, she had to run errands. But she'll be here next week, and she's looking forward to it. Isn't that nice?\nRICHARD: I suppose.\nEMILY: I think so, too. Would you like to see my present?\nRICHARD: Well, that's very nice. That'll fit right in with your collection, Emily.\nEMILY: Yes, it will.\nRORY: We got something for you, too, Grandpa. [hands him a gift]\nRICHARD: Well, I guess you're not the only one who gets a treat tonight.\nEMILY: Oh, and just when I thought I was special.\n[Richard opens the gift, a pipe]\nRICHARD: Look at that. That's beautiful.\nRORY: We found this amazing pipe store in Copenhagen and the man there can carve anything you want. His family's been doing it for over a hundred and fifty years. And they had a whole set of Alice in Wonderland pipes that Mom wanted to get, but they were way too expensive so we just got the Queen of Hearts.\nRICHARD: Well, I love it.\nEMILY: Yes, and you're gonna love it outside on the patio.\nRICHARD: As you wish, my dear. [the phone rings] That's my call, that's my call.\nEMILY: Hurry back, or we'll start without you.\nRICHARD: Five minutes. Ten, tops. [leaves room]\nEMILY: He'll be an hour.\nRORY: Is his new business going well?\nEMILY: Oh, who knows? He's not in the room long enough to find out.\nMAID: Dinner is served, Mrs. Gilmore.\nEMILY: All right, Gerta. Well, I guess we should go in and eat.\nRORY: What about Grandpa?\nEMILY: Oh, we'll save him something.\nRORY: Okay.\nCUT TO THE DINING ROOM\n[Emily, Richard, and Rory are eating dinner]\nRICHARD: So, Rory, tell me, how were the Gundersons?\nRORY: The who?\nRICHARD: The Gundersons. Our friends in Zurich. The ones we told you two to look up when you got there.\nRORY: Oh, the Gundersons, right.\nRICHARD: I tell ya, they better have given you a first class welcome. Especially after that son of theirs squatted here for over a month last year.\nEMILY: And ruined the rug in the guest room.\nRICHARD: That's right. Hope you ruined one of their rugs as well.\nRORY: Actually, we, um, we didn't get a chance to see the Gundersons.\nRICHARD: Hm?\nEMILY: Why not? Were they out of town?\nRORY: Well, I -\nRICHARD: You did go to Zurich, didn't you?\nRORY: Yes, but, you know, Zurich was so crazy for us that we just figured, 'Ah, we'll just catch 'em next time.'\nRICHARD: You didn't call them?\nRORY: You know, there really wasn't time.\nRICHARD: Well, what about the Egerholms in Denmark? Is their new house a monstrosity?\nRORY: Well, if you think Zurich was hectic, then Denmark was just. . .whoo!\nRICHARD: You didn't call them?\nRORY: Um, no.\nRICHARD: The Rezoscos in Florence?\nRORY: No.\nRICHARD: The Talbots in London?\nRORY: We were only in London for two days.\nRICHARD: Well, who did you look up when you went to Europe?\nRORY: Jim Morrison says hello.\nRICHARD: You didn't look up one of our friends? We must've given you fifteen names.\nRORY: I know, but we got so caught up in the backpacking aspect of it that it just kind of slipped our minds.\nRICHARD: You know what that means, Emily. We're going to have to stay with the Gundersons when we go to Zurich in the fall.\nEMILY: Rory, would you like another piece of chicken?\nRICHARD: Tiresome people.\nRORY: I've already had two, Grandma.\nRICHARD: I'm sorry, why are we friends with them again?\nEMILY: Well, just take it and nibble at it if you want to. Gerta, you can put the soufflé in now.\nRORY: Soufflé?\nEMILY: Yes, we're going to have a special dessert, something to celebrate your homecoming.\nRICHARD: Well, why didn't she put it in the oven when we sat down to dinner? Those things take forever to cook.\nEMILY: You know, every time we go to Paris, I marvel at their ability to turn a simple meal into a three or four hour event. Makes every day seem like a party. So tonight, I thought we'd be European. I thought maybe we'd have a cheese plate before dessert and coffee. How does that sound? Bon?\nRORY: Oh, yes. Very. . .bon.\nEMILY: It's nice to mix it up once in awhile. Oh, I have a wonderful idea. Rory, have you ever seen a ballroom dancing competition?\nRORY: Uh, no.\nEMILY: You would love it. It is so exciting, and the costumes are beautiful. I've been taping them since 1978. Can you imagine?\nRORY: No.\nEMILY: All right, then. After dessert, you and I are going to hunker down in that den that we never use and I am pulling out those tapes. We'll just start at the beginning and see how far we get. Perfect, here's the cheese. I'll take that, Gerta. Richard, do you want to start?\nCUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD\n[Lorelai and Luke are loading Rory's things for Yale into the back of Luke's truck]\nLUKE: Jeez, you think you go to a fancy school like Yale there'd be a mattress in the room.\nLORELAI: Yeah. Go figure, huh?\nLUKE: You packed her stuff in Hefty bags?\nLORELAI: Hey, she's lucky I even had these in the house.\nLUKE: If you needed luggage, you should've asked me.\nLORELAI: You have luggage?\nLUKE: Yes, I have luggage. Why wouldn't I have luggage?\nLORELAI: You never go anywhere.\nLUKE: I just went on a seven-country cruise.\nLORELAI: That's right, the mystery cruise that you don't wanna talk about.\nLUKE: I told you I brought luggage. What more info do you need?\nLORELAI: Why won't you tell me what happened?\nLUKE: Because.\nLORELAI: Why? Luke, I swear, I'm dying to know, but every time I bring it up, you spaz out. Why won't you tell me? I would tell you.\nLUKE: Yes, but I wouldn't wanna know.\nLORELAI: Did something happen with you and Nicole?\nLUKE: Yes.\nLORELAI: What? Did you propose?\nLUKE: Yes.\nLORELAI: Oh my God, you proposed?\nLUKE: Yes, I proposed.\nLORELAI: This is big. This is huge.\nLUKE: There's more.\nLORELAI: There's more? Okay, well, what? Did she say yes?\nLUKE: Yes.\nLORELAI: She said yes. You proposed and she said yes. Wow, I -\nLUKE: There's more.\nLORELAI: And there's more after you proposed and she said yes? What, you -\nLUKE: We got married.\nLORELAI: You got married? How could you get married?\nLUKE: We asked the captain and he married us.\nLORELAI: And that's legal?\nLUKE: Apparently.\nLORELAI: So you're married? You're legally married? This is just -\nLUKE: Actually, there's a little more.\nLORELAI: And she's pregnant. Oh my God, you finally reproduced.\nLUKE: We're getting divorced.\nLORELAI: I'm gonna sit down now.\nLUKE: It just all happened so fast.\nLORELAI: Well, yeah.\n[they sit down on the front porch steps]\nLUKE: I mean, you're on this boat in the middle of nowhere and everything's moving and you feel weird all the time. There's this endless supply of food and drink. Uh, midnight buffets, by the way, are the reason the rest of the world hates us. And everyone around us was either in love, engaged, or celebrating their hundredth wedding anniversary, and we were having a good time. . . and there you go.\nLORELAI: There you go.\nLUKE: Of course, the next morning we both woke up and realized we'd lost our minds. We tried to ignore it for awhile, you know, went snorkeling, but by the time we hit land, we were separated, and now we're getting divorced.\nLORELAI: Okay, well, my jet lag and your love life is making me dizzy. Is there more?\nLUKE: Nope, that's it.\nLORELAI: I'm sorry.\nLUKE: Ah, it's okay.\nLORELAI: Well, look on the bright side. I mean, now that you've been married, it'll silence all those questions.\nLUKE: What questions?\nLORELAI: You know, a single man of a certain age who lives alone.\nLUKE: You're kidding.\nLORELAI: Hey, I always defended you. I always said, \"Hey, so what if he is?\"\nLUKE: Thank you for your support.\n[Lorelai's cell phone rings]\nLORELAI: [answers] Hello?\nRORY: She's taken me hostage.\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: She's not letting me leave. Dinner lasted an hour. She didn't even put the soufflé in the oven until we'd already finished, and now we're watching taped ballroom dancing competitions that date back to the 1800's.\nLORELAI: You haven't left yet?\nRORY: Are you listening to me? I can't leave. She won't let me leave ever. This is Iran in '79 and you are Jimmy Carter. What do we do?\nLORELAI: Well, first we have to lose the Jimmy Carter comparison, and second, I have to come get you. This is about me and me not showing up, so maybe if I put in an appearance, she'll let you go.\nRORY: Okay, but come quickly because she's got a lot of tapes and they rewind really slow.\nLORELAI: I'm on my way. [hangs up] Um, hey, so, uh, I have to go get Rory.\nLUKE: Everything okay?\nLORELAI: Uh, yeah. You know, my mother's a psycho, so. . .business as usual.\nLUKE: Yeah.\nLORELAI: Thanks for the help.\nLUKE: Sure.\nLORELAI: And I am sorry.\nLUKE: I'll be fine.\n[Kirk walks by in a skydiver's outfit, trailing a parachute behind him]\nKIRK: Strong wind.\nCUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE\n[In the den, Emily puts a ballroom dancing tape into the VCR, then sits next to Rory on the couch]\nEMILY: Now I think you're really going to see quite a difference from the early eighties. They really start to mix it up in '88.\nRORY: Mmhmm.\nEMILY: Oh, see right there, see that move? Five years ago it was not allowed. Could've gotten you kicked right out.\nRORY: That's harsh.\nEMILY: Oh, yes. Ballroom dancing can be very harsh. Oh, look. The couple in the purple feathers - that's Corky and Shirley Ballas. I love them, they are so talented. Corky's actually writing a musical based on their life as ballroom champions, and their son, Corky Jr., is going to play him as a young man.\nRORY: Wow. Two Corky's in one show. Don't see that everyday.\n[Lorelai walks in]\nLORELAI: Hey.\nRORY: Mom, hi!\nLORELAI: There you guys are.\nEMILY: What are you doing here?\nLORELAI: Well, you know, it's funny, I just happen to be in the neighborhood and I thought to myself, I wonder what's doing at the Gilmore house.\nRORY: We're watching National Ballroom Dancing competitions.\nLORELAI: You are? Well, that sounds fun. Mind if I watch with you?\nEMILY: I don't think you'd enjoy it.\nLORELAI: Oh, no, I'm sure I would.\nEMILY: Well, you've already missed the beginning.\nLORELAI: I'm betting you could catch me up.\nEMILY: Rory, would you go ask Gerta if she would make me some tea?\nRORY: Uh, sure, Grandma. [leaves]\nLORELAI: No, nothing for me, Mom. Thanks. Um, so what's new?\nEMILY: Well, you obviously weren't just in the neighborhood, so why don't you tell me what you're doing here?\nLORELAI: Uh, you know, I came to see you.\nEMILY: You came to get Rory.\nLORELAI: Mom, she's been here for hours. Patty Hearst had a shorter incarceration.\nEMILY: She's not being held hostage, Lorelai. I resent that. She's spending time with me, something you obviously don't want to do.\nLORELAI: Mom, I'm sorry I missed dinner tonight.\nEMILY: Come to dinner, don't come to dinner, it makes no difference to me. You are under no obligation to us any longer.\nLORELAI: I know, but -\nEMILY: You're very busy, I understand. I wouldn't wanna keep you any longer.\nLORELAI: Mom, please, let me take Rory with me.\nEMILY: No. Tonight is my night with Rory.\nLORELAI: You're keeping her from me on purpose.\nEMILY: If Rory wants to leave, she can ask to leave. She's not a four-year old.\nLORELAI: Well, she's not gonna hurt your feelings by asking to leave.\nEMILY: Why should she? She knows you'll be along any second to do it for her.\nLORELAI: Mom, why do you always make everything so hard? Don't you understand, this is my last night with my daughter! She goes off to college tomorrow!\nEMILY: I know, which is why I was so surprised you didn't want to spend the evening with her.\nLORELAI: I do!\nEMILY: Then you should've come!\nLORELAI: I couldn't!\nEMILY: You wouldn't!\nLORELAI: Ugh, I swear to God! Where's Dad?\nEMILY: Oh, he went to bed hours ago.\nLORELAI: He went to bed?\nEMILY: Well, it was getting late.\n[Lorelai laughs a little]\nEMILY: Why are you laughing?\nLORELAI: Um, you know, you've got Rory locked in here with the Mambo Kings, and, um, and Dad went to bed.\nEMILY: So what? Why is that funny?\nLORELAI: Because. . .you know, she's here and he's there and. . .God, I'm so tired.\n[Lorelai keeps laughing. Rory walks in]\nRORY: What's so funny?\nEMILY: Oh, she's having a fit.\nRORY: Mom?\nLORELAI: Oh my God. [laughs harder]\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: I just got the Jimmy Carter reference.\n[Lorelai and Rory laugh]\nEMILY: As soon as you're both done. . .\nCUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE\n[Later that night, Lorelai and Rory are watching ballroom dancing in the den]\nRORY: Oh, watch this. This part's really good.\nLORELAI: Ouch, that has got to hurt.\nRORY: Cool, huh?\nLORELAI: Extremely. Plus, the whole matching haircut thing adds a level of commitment to their act that the other acts just lack. Oh, hey, careful where you put the hand there, mister.\nRORY: You know they rehearse every night, plus they have classes, plus they go to the gym four times a week?\nLORELAI: Hm. Oh my God, she's balancing on his hand. He is like Superman. Or Wonder Woman. Either way, he's very strong.\nRORY: So, tomorrow. . .\nLORELAI: Yeah, tomorrow.\nRORY: It's a big day.\nLORELAI: It's a really big day.\nRORY: I just hope it's everything I've been imagining it to be.\nLORELAI: Yeah. I just hope you actually get there.\n[they glance at Emily sleeping on the other couch, then continue watching the television]\nLORELAI: You know, if Sofia could just die during a fox trot, that would be perfect.\nRORY: Biscotti?\nLORELAI: Yes, please.\n[Rory hands her one from the bag]\nLORELAI: They're all broken.\nRORY: I know. I like 'em that way.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

        "prompt_0": "Act 1\nScene 1 - The Radio Station. Fade in. Frasier is on the air.\nFrasier: Go ahead, Sophie, I'm listening.\nSophie: [v.o.] Hi, Dr. Crane. My husband's having some of his friends over to watch the game Sunday, and I think it'd be nice if I could have some of my girlfriends over too.\nFrasier: Sounds reasonable.\nSophie: Exactly. I mean, it's just football.\nLarry: [in the background] Not football, Einstein, the Super Bowl.\nFrasier: Ah, that would be your doting husband now.\nSophie: Larry, this is a private conversation. And for God's sake, use a plate!\nFrasier: Sophie, why don't you put your husband on the line?\nSophie: Pick up.\nLarry: Ah, geez. [picks up, louder] Hello!\nFrasier: Larry, I gotta tell you, I'm afraid I side with your wife on this one.\nLarry: That just proves you don't know the first thing about football.\nFrasier: What I do or do not know about football has...\nLarry: OK, how's this: My wife's friends can come over if you can answer even one little football question. Like...\nFrasier: Now, I don't see that that's in any...\nLarry: You're down by six, you're on your own forty, three seconds left, what do you do?\nFrasier: Well, all right, you would...\nRoz gets his attention and grabs two telephone handsets.\nFrasier: You would take your receivers, [Roz sets them together] and line them up, [she pretends to throw] and then throw a pass. [big throwing gesture] A long, long pass.\nLarry: Yeah, and what's the name for that?\nRoz gets down on her knees, crosses herself, and prays with an innocent look on her face.\nFrasier: A Hail Mary. [Roz gives him the thumbs up.] Sophie and Larry, I hope you enjoy the game. In the meanwhile, this is Coach Crane saying, I'm listening.\nRoz comes over to change some tapes on Frasier's console.\nRoz: I'm impressed you're so good at charades.\nFrasier: I'm impressed you could mime a virgin. So, Roz, you walkin' out?\nRoz: No, I got stuff I gotta do. I've got some carts to rack, and I want to put together some Best of Crane tapes.\nFrasier: Oh, your mother's still in town?\nRoz: In town, in my apartment, and when I left this morning, in my refrigerator, smelling my milk!\nFrasier: Oh, lord.\nRoz: I, I love her, I just wish I could get a couple of hours to myself one night.\nFrasier: Well, why don't you just ask her? She might enjoy a little time to herself. I know my dad does.\nRoz: You are so lucky. I wish my mother drank alone.\nThey walk over to Roz's side.\nFrasier: You know, Roz, your mom's about the same age as my dad, isn't she?\nRoz: Yeah, I guess.\nFrasier: Does she date much?\nRoz: Since my father left, practically never... no, hang on...\nFrasier: No, no, hear me out, Roz. Now, Dad hasn't dated anybody since he and Sherry broke up, I'm starting to worry he's lost his nerve. A date with your mom could be a tremendous favor to him.\nRoz: I don't know.\nFrasier: Oh, come on, I'll tell you what: I know it's awkward but there's a way to minimize that. Niles and I are having dinner with him tonight. We'll take him to McGinty's, he'll feel comfortable, you and your mother can just happen by. We'll see what transpires, you know, they'll never even know it's a fix-up.\nRoz: Oh, what the hell, I'll give it a shot, I guess. How's five sound?\nFrasier: Five? Your mother is ready for dinner at five?\nRoz: I keep her on Wisconsin time, that way she's in bed by eight.\nFrasier walks out. FADE OUT.\nA.K.A THE LAST ONION\nOUT OF POMPEII\nScene 2 - McGinty's Fade in. Niles and Frasier are sitting at a table, Martin brings a plate over.\nMartin: Hey, look what I got here, boys! A Funion Onion. The chef sent it over with his compliments.\nFrasier: I wonder what his insults are like.\nMartin: [to a waitress] Hey, Bonnie!\nBonnie: Hey ya, Marty. Oh, you must be Frasier, the big radio star.\nFrasier: Oh, yes. Hello.\nBonnie: Your dad is so proud of you, he talks about you all the time. Who's your friend?\nMartin: Now, what's wrong with you? I told you about my other son.\nBonnie: [shaking Niles's hand] Oh, of course, what am I thinking? Nice to meet you, Eddie.\nMartin: This is Niles. How 'bout some beers, Bonnie?\nBonnie: Coming right up.\nNiles: Oh God, look. The group coming in the door, they're from the Shangri-La.\nA group of guys come over and punch Niles on the shoulder. He puts up his fists and weaves back and forth.\nJimbo: Whoa, it's the Coyote!\nNiles: Evening, evening, Jimbo. Check you later.\nThe guys go over to the bar.\nMartin: Wow, you got a nickname down there already. That's great! The Coyote?\nNiles: Yes.\nFrasier: And how did you earn that honorific?\nNiles: Oh, it was quite the merry road. Yes. It evolved from Niles to Nilesy to Niley to Nile E. Coyote and now simply \"The Coyote.\"\nThe guys at the bar start howling at him.\nNiles: Oh, well, just when I thought it couldn't be refined any further.\nRoz and her mother, Joanna, come in.\n[N.B. Eva Marie Saint's first (and Oscar-winning) film role was as Edie Doyle, Marlon Brando's love interest in 1954's \"On the Waterfront.\"]\nFrasier: Oh, goodness, look who's here! Roz!\nRoz: What? We don't see enough of each other during the day?\nFrasier: Hello, Joanna.\nJoanna: Nice to see you again, Frasier.\nFrasier: Nice to see you again, too. Please, won't you sit down and join us?\nJoanna: Oh, no, we don't want to intrude.\nFrasier: Oh, no, no, please, the more the merrier.\nRoz: All right. Mom, this is Frasier's dad, Martin Crane. This is my mom, Joanna Doyle.\nMartin: Very nice to meet you. And this is my other son, Niles.\nNiles: How do you do?\nJoanna: It's a pleasure.\nDISSOLVE TO: after dinner. Martin and Joanna have cleaned their plates, while the others still have food.\nFrasier: Roz, will you just look at the two of them.\nRoz: How did you two manage to finish all that?\nJoanna: Oh, please. This is how our generation ate every day. I used to live on cigarettes, whiskey sours and bacon cheeseburgers.\nMartin: Yeah, and what about breakfast? Fried eggs, sausage patties, hash browns...\nNiles: My God, last night I ate a profiterole and lay awake 'til dawn waiting for my heart attack.\nJoanna: Those were simpler times, weren't they, Marty?\nMartin: Oh yeah, we didn't worry about dumb things like cholesterol. We worried about puttin' food on the table, keepin' the yard clean and the car shiny.\nJoanna: And the H-bomb.\nMartin: Well, yeah, that.\nFrasier: Say, Roz, we better be going if we're going to get that work done tonight.\nNiles: Oh, I should be going too.\nRoz: Mom and me are going to that jazz club on Fifth.\nFrasier: But we promised to finish those promos tonight.\nRoz: Oh, right. Mom, I'm sorry, I totally forgot.\nJoanna: It's OK.\nFrasier: Wait, I've got an idea. Uh, Dad, since I'm kidnapping Roz, why don't you take Joanna to the jazz club?\nMartin: Well, sure, I'd love to.\nRoz: Is that OK with you, Mom?\nJoanna: If Martin's game, I'm game.\nFrasier: Oh, well, perfect. OK, you kids just have some coffee, we'll see you back at the apartment later, OK?\nJoanna: All right.\nNiles: Very, very nice to meet you.\nJoanna: Thank you.\nRoz, Frasier and Niles go to pay the check.\nJoanna: Look at them. They think we don't know this is a setup.\nMartin: Well, how could we figure it out? We're just a retired detective and an attorney general. [they laugh]\nCUT TO: Roz and Frasier by the bar.\nRoz: You were absolutely right, they didn't suspect a thing.\nFrasier: I told you Roz, just leave it to the master.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene 3 - Frasier's Apartment. Fade in. Daphne is sitting in Martin's chair eating popcorn and watching television. Roz brings another bowl in from the kitchen. Frasier is on the couch.\nRoz: God, I thought they'd be home by now.\nFrasier: Roz, will you please relax and watch the pageant with us? They're right in the middle of the talent competition.\n[She sits next to him.]\nDaphne: It's shameless the way they're sucking up to the international panel of judges. Miss Germany just played \"Lady of Spain\" on a French horn.\nFrasier: Roz, you're gonna chew that nail right off. Stop it.\nRoz: I can't help it. I'm nervous. Do you think it's gonna turn out OK?\nFrasier: Who cares?\nDaphne: Not for Miss Brazil. Look at the tree trunks on her. She's her own little rain forest.\nRoz: I just keep worrying that she's gonna have a lousy time, and it will be all my fault. Screwing up, like always.\nFrasier: Oh, come on, Roz. Your mother doesn't think you're a screwup.\nRoz: Oh, yeah? In high school, I ran my own informal shoplifting clinic. In college, I dropped out of pre-law because it interfered with Bruce Springsteen's touring schedule. And now I'm an unwed mother. What would you call me?\nDaphne: Tramp.\nFrasier: Daphne!\nDaphne: It's Miss Venezuela. If that dress of hers was slit any higher, you could see Caracas.\nFrasier stares at the set, Roz has to nudge him to get his attention.\nFrasier: Oh, oh, Roz. You know what? So what if they don't get along? So we made a mistake.\nRoz: [getting up for some sherry] You don't understand. My mother doesn't make mistakes. She does everything well. She's smart, successful, classy... oh, what the hell was I thinking?\nFrasier: [rising] About what? Setting her up with my father?\nRoz: No, that's not what I meant.\nFrasier: That is exactly what you meant!\nRoz: Well, OK, Frasier. No offense, your father is a very nice\nman, but let's face it: My mother was the attorney general of Wisconsin.\nFrasier: Well I hope he remembers to curtsey before the Dairy Queen!\nDaphne: [getting up] This is ridiculous. I'm going to watch this in my room. Miss Finland just laid out her plan to end world hunger, and I missed it!\nShe goes off to her room. There is the sound of the key in the lock at the front door.\nFrasier: Oh, lord. He and Roz hurry to sit on the couch.\nFrasier: Oh, Roz, that is the best promo of all.\nRoz: Oh, hi! How was your evening?\nJoanna: Oh, the jazz was first rate. But I'm afraid I talked Martin's ear off.\nMartin: Oh, you're crazy. Your mother tells wonderful stories, Roz. I could have listened to her all night.\nJoanna: You are either too kind or a little tipsy. But thank you. Come on, Lammy. I really had a lovely time.\nMartin: Well, I can't remember when I had a better time. We're gonna have to do this again.\nJoanna: Bye, Frasier.\nFrasier: Goodnight, Joanna. Lammy.\nThey leave and Frasier turns to Martin.\nFrasier: [grinning] So... Tell me all about it.\nMartin: Well, being a gentleman, I don't want to go into the details, so suffice it to say, it STUNK!\nFrasier: What?\nMartin: [putting up his coat] That was the dullest evening of my life. The way she drones on and on. Do you know how many metric tons of eggs Wisconsin produces every year?\nFrasier: No.\nMartin: Well, I do!\nFrasier: Oh...\nMartin: Look, Frasier, I know you meant well, but if you ever set me up again, I'll kill you in your sleep. Goodnight.\nHe goes off to bed. There is a quiet but insistent knocking at the door. Frasier opens it to reveal Roz.\nRoz: [excited] I told my mom to meet me downstairs. I just had to come up and tell you. She had the best time! She can't wait to go out with your father again. Will you tell him to call her tomorrow? Oh, Frasier, this whole thing worked out like a dream!\nMartin: [crossing to the kitchen] It's amazing! Her voice is still echoing in my head!\nFrasier: Yes, it's like a fairy tale over here, too.\nRoz leaves. FADE OUT. End of Act 1 Act 2\nScene 1 - Cafe Nervosa. Fade in. Frasier and Niles are standing at the counter.\nFrasier: I've just got to find some way to tell Roz.\nNiles: Why? It's just going to hurt her mom's feelings.\nFrasier: Her feelings are going to be hurt anyway. She's here 'til Sunday. She's expecting him to call. Oh, dear God. At least this way Roz can let her down easy.\nTheir coffees come.\nNiles: Looks like both of us have difficult conversations ahead of us.\nFrasier: What's yours?\nNiles: All week long, I have been getting less coffee and more foam in my cappuccino. It's about time for someone to raise a little hell. Who's on steamer duty?\nFrasier: Well, it's that hulking fellow, Thad. The one who doesn't react when his arm touches the steamer nozzle.\nThad comes from the back. He is huge.\nNiles: Where is that suggestion box? He walks over and Roz comes in.\nRoz: Oh, hey Frasier.\nFrasier: Hi, Roz.\nRoz: Double espresso to go, please. [Roz and Frasier sit.] Listen, I really need to thank you again. My mother had the best time last night. And when we got home, WE started talking. We ended up staying up half the night.\nFrasier: Oh, Roz I'm glad for you, but...\nRoz: It was like a wall came down. She just opened up to me. She started talking about how hard it was on her when my dad left, and how lonely she's been, and it was like she was talking to a girlfriend instead of her screw-up daughter. So, has Martin called her yet?\nFrasier: No. But he will. Soon. Uh, he had a really busy morning.\nRoz: Well, how does this weekend look? 'Cause she's leaving Sunday night.\nFrasier: Sunday? Oh, well let's see, tonight is poker night, that's no good. Saturday he's made plans to, uh, drive Duke to Tacoma for that all day... Tacoma-Fest.\nRoz: Well, on Sunday we go to a matinee and then I drive her to the airport.\nFrasier: Oh, darn.\nRoz: Wait a minute. I can give my ticket to Martin and they can go together.\nFrasier: No, no, Sunday's no good, because that's the, uh...\nRoz: Oh right, it's the Super Bowl!\nFrasier: Right, the Super Bowl. You know how Dad is about football, it's like a religion with him. In fact, he's made Niles and I promise that we'd watch it with him this year.\nRoz: Oh, well, OK. Let's just forget about the tickets and we'll come over and watch the game. Is there any reason why that won't work?\nFrasier: Not that I can come up with.\nRoz: That's great, my mom's going to be so excited. [She turns to pay her bill, Niles takes it and puts it on the counter.] Oh, thank you, Niles. I'll see you Sunday at your Super Bowl party.\nShe leaves and Niles sits.\nNiles: [sitting] I see you told Roz the news and she went insane.\nFrasier: Couldn't do it. Told her we were watching the Super Bowl with Dad and she and her mother are coming over.\nNiles: This is a nightmare!\nFrasier: I know. I've got to find some way to tell Dad.\nNiles: I have to watch the Super Bowl?!\nFrasier: I suppose the sooner I tell him, the better.\nNiles: Oh, not necessarily.\nFrasier: What do you mean?\nNiles: Well, you know Dad. If you warn him Joanna's coming over, he'll just bolt to McGinty's. If I were you, I'd wait until five minutes before game time and then spring it on him. That way he has no choice but to stay.\nFrasier: I think I owe him more than five minutes' warning. Besides, Dad would never deliberately hurt Joanna standing her up. He is first and foremost a gentleman.\nMartin comes in.\nMartin: I saw Roz, so I hid outside in case that old gasbag of a mother was with her. Well, I guess she wasn't, everybody's still awake.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nROUGHING THE PASSER\nScene 2 - Frasier's Apartment Fade in. Martin is watching the pre-game as Frasier paces nervously.\nMartin: Look at those guys in the locker room. Nervous, hearts pounding, probably a little sick to their stomachs, poor kids.\nFrasier: Yes. Until I got out of high school, I didn't there was any other way to feel in a locker room.\nMartin: What's the matter with you? You keep looking at your watch.\nFrasier: Was I?\nMartin: Yeah. Is there something on your mind?\nFrasier: No, no, but there's something I wanted to talk to you about, but now's not the time.\nThe doorbell rings.\nFrasier: Now's the time.\nMartin: Just let me get the door.\nFrasier: No, Dad, Dad, that's what I have to talk to you about. You see, that's going to be Roz and her mother.\nMartin: What?\nFrasier: Well, Joanna had such a good time with you the other night, and you did say that you would see her again, and rather than send her home with her feelings hurt, I had to tell her you wanted her here.\nMartin: What, like a date?\nFrasier: Well, that's the beauty of it. It's like a date, but it's not a date. Just, you know, make small talk, you pass the dip.\nMartin: No, Frasier, you don't understand...\nFrasier: Now, Dad, I know you found her a little less than scintillating, but please, it'll be over before you know it.\nFrasier opens the door, Bonnie is there.\nBonnie: Hey, Frasier.\nFrasier: Hi, Bonnie.\nBonnie: Martin.\nMartin: Hey, Bonnie, glad you could make it. Let me hold this. See, this is what I was trying to tell you, Frasier, I invited Bonnie.\nFrasier: [taking her coat] Oh, how nice.\nMartin: Well, what do you got here?\nBonnie: Oh, it's my special deviled ham in the shape of a football. But I still need to put on some macaroni laces.\nMartin: Oh, the kitchen's right down there, just holler if you need anything. [She heads over.]\nFrasier: What did you invite her for?\nMartin: Well, because I like her, and I thought I might want to ask her out, and I thought if she came over for the game it might be a step in the right direction. I mean \"like a date but not a date.\"\nThe doorbell rings again.\nFrasier: Now that's gonna be Roz and her mother.\nBonnie: Should I put some coffee on while I'm in here?\nMartin: You better, we're gonna need it.\nFrasier: Would you come on, Dad? Would it kill you to be civil for the length of one Super Bowl? What is that, an hour out of your life?\nHe opens the door to Joanna and Roz. Alice is with them.\nMartin: Hi! [The ladies shush them and motion to the baby.] Sorry. Come on in.\nJoanna: Thanks so much for inviting us.\nMartin: Wouldn't be fun without you.\nRoz: Frasier, could you show Mom where Alice can finish her nap?\nFrasier: I'm sure Dad would love to.\nMartin: My pleasure, just come this way, Joanna. So, you a big football fan?\nJoanna: No, actually I've never even seen a game. I was hoping you'd explain as we go along.\nThey head down the hall, Martin pauses to glare at Frasier.\nBonnie: [coming from the kitchen] OK, who's hungry? Oh, hey, I'm Bonnie.\nRoz: Hi, from McGinty's. I didn't know you were coming.\nBonnie: Yeah, Martin invited me. He was real cute about it. He checked with all the waitresses to find out if I was single.\nRoz: Oh. [She looks questioningly at Frasier.]\nFrasier: Yes, well you know how Dad is always trying to, ah...\nNiles comes in.\nBonnie: Hey, the Coyote!\nFrasier: Find a new girl for Niles. Niles, you remember Bonnie. She waited on us at McGinty's.\nNiles: Oh, of course. I'll have a vodka martini, very dry.\nFrasier: Don't be silly, Niles. Bonnie is here as our guest.\nRoz: Yeah, your dad thought you two might hit it off.\nNiles: [not enthused] Oh.\nBonnie: [even less enthused] Oh.\nNiles: The Superbowl and a date. Hot diggity!\nBonnie: Well, come here, you're just in time for my specialty.\nNiles: Oh, I... [She pops a cracker in his mouth.] Mmmm! Isn't that interesting! Something formerly ham.\nDaphne: [coming from her room] Well, I'm off to the cinema.\nNiles: You're not staying for the game?\nDaphne: Sorry, but Ameican football's not for me, and they're showing \"Wuthering Heights\" downtown. I think it's the most romantic movie ever made.\nNiles: You're going alone?\nDaphne: Yes, unfortunately. It's more fun to go with someone, except of course it always ends the same way: Me weeping all over me date's shoulder while he does what he can to comfort me.\nBonnie: Oh, you should have seen me cry putting onions in this ham loaf. I must've gone through a whole roll of toilet paper.\nDaphne: Well, enjoy your game.\nNiles: Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen?\nMartin and Joanna come back.\nMartin: That's amazing! You do all you do and you still have time to be a docent at the cheese museum on the weekends? Frasier, can I see you in the kitchen?\nFrasier: Just a second, Dad, I gotta take drink orders in here.\nCut to the kitchen. Martin comes in as Niles is rinsing his mouth at the tap.\nNiles: Thanks for setting me up with that Spam-happy tootsy.\nMartin: What are you talking about?\nNiles: Bonnie. Frasier told me you invited her here for me.\nMartin: I invited her here for me. He probably said I invited her for you because he didn't want to upset Miss Boring's feelings.\nFrasier: [entering] Now, now, no private conversations. Your dates are waiting.\nMartin: They're not our dates!\nNiles: We hate them!\nFrasier: Now listen. I realize that this is a very difficult situation, but if we all cooperate, we can send everybody home happy. Dad, if you would like, you can discretely take Bonnie aside and tell her what's going on.\nMartin: Bonnie, can I tell you something?\nFrasier: I said DISCRETELY!\nCut to the living room.\nJoanna: I think the game is about to start.\nRoz: Oh, that reminds me, I want to get Alice's bottle warming.\nBonnie: Oh, you have a baby?\nJoanna: Oh, the most adorable little girl.\nMartin: Oh, she's a real beaut! You oughta see her, Bonnie.\nRoz: You can come with me if you want when I feed her.\nMartin: No, you go ahead and get that ready, I'll show Bonnie, it's right through there.\nFrasier: Now, Dad, don't you get fresh with Niles's girl, there.\nMartin: Oh, I won't if he won't.\nHe and Bonnie head to the bedroom.\nJoanna: Your father is really smitten with that baby, isn't he?\nRoz: I think he's just got a weak spot for the Doyle women.\nJoanna: Oh.\nFrasier: Yes, well, he may appear to have a crusty exterior, but deep down inside, Dad's just an old softy.\nMartin and Bonnie's voices come from the baby monitor\nMartin: [v.o.] Well, there's the kid. Kind of a goony-looking thing, isn't she?\nNiles: Is that Dad?\nMartin: Look, Bonnie, I gotta tell you somethin'. I didn't ask you here for Niles, I asked you here for me.\nFrasier: It's the baby monitor! We should just...\nJoanna: [grabbing it away from Niles and Frasier] Shh. I want to hear this.\nBonnie: But I thought you were with Joanna.\nMartin: No, no. Frasier and Roz set us up last week. I told Frasier I thought she was a big snooze. Especially compared to the fun you and I have at the bar, but he stuck me with her again.\nFrasier: You know, I bet they know it's on...\nRoz: Yeah.\nFrasier: And they're just having some fun with us...\nRoz: Yeah.\nJoanna: Frasier, just stay put.\nBonnie: Then Niles isn't my date? Oh, there's a relief. I mean, no offense, Marty, but...\nMartin: Hey, you don't have to tell me.\nNiles: [grabbing his coat] OK. If anybody wants me, I'll be at the movies. [He rushes out.]\nBonnie: So you really like me? You're not just pulling my leg?\nMartin: You want proof?\nJoanna: I think we can turn this off now.\nFrasier: Joanna, I am so sorry. I know it sounded bad, but...\nJoanna: No, no, not at all. I'm sure your father meant \"big snooze\" in the most flattering sense. Roz, maybe we should leave.\nRoz: What were you thinking?\nFrasier: Oh, Roz, I certainly wasn't thinking that he had a date planned.\nRoz: I'm just going to get Alice. Mom, I'm so sorry.\nJoanna: Believe me. Twenty years in politics, I've been called worse things than boring.\nRoz heads back, Joanna heads for the door.\nJoanna: Well, I hope you'll understand if I just slip out without saying goodbye to Martin?\nFrasier: Of course, Joanna. The last thing we need today is another awkward situation.\nMartin: [o.s.] Whoa-ho-ho, Roz! Knock, will ya?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene 3 - Frasier's Apartment. Fade in. Frasier opens the door to Roz.\nRoz: I left my diaper bag.\nFrasier: Right. Can you come in for a bit?\nRoz: I really shouldn't.\nFrasier: Roz, I'm so sorry.\nRoz: It's all right. I mean, I'm not gonna say that my mother wasn't hurt, but she did start to smile a little bit about it on the way to the airport.\nFrasier: You know, I've been sitting here, trying to figure out why I was so eager to play matchmaker for Dad.\nRoz: Oh, you're not alone. I mean, I was excited once I thought it was going well.\nFrasier: Well, I suspect I wasn't doing it so much for him as I was doing it for me. I see him here all the time, all alone, I wonder if maybe that's not gonna be me someday.\nRoz: Oh, God. I think the same thing sometimes when I see these older ladies in my building. They all want to babysit Alice just for the company. I mean, she's a cute baby, but she ain't no Dorthy Parker.\nFrasier: Ah, well, we're both gonna be fine. I was just thinking, though, if we wanna play it safe, we could make one of those, uh, pacts.\nRoz: You mean, like in forty years, if neither one of us finds anyone...\nFrasier: Yeah, exactly, we'll marry each other.\nRoz: I was gonna say kill each other.\nFrasier: Well, six of one...\nThey laugh as he closes the door. FADE OUT.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNiles is at Cafe Nervosa. The waiter brings his cappuccino. Angered at the amount of coffee, he pulls out his notepad and jots a complaint. He goes to put it in the suggestion box but as he gets there, Thad comes out. Niles crumples the note and Thad holds up the trash can for him. Niles ends up throwing the note past his head and runs out. Guest Appearances Special Guest Star EVA MARIE SAINT as Joanna Doyle\nGuest Starring ALICE PLAYTEN as Bonnie ROCKY McMURRAY as Jimbo\nGuest Callers PHIL DONAHUE as Larry MARLO THOMAS as Sophie Quick Summary {nicholas hartley}\nACT ONE\nSCENE ONE - KACL\nFrasier is on air and is taking his last caller. It's a woman who says her husband is having a superbowl party on Sunday for his friends however he won't let her friends come over. The husband comes onto the phone and says he'll let them come over if he can answer a simple football question. Roz mimes the answers to Frasier in order he can get it correct. After signing off as \"Coach Crane\" he has a chat with Roz where she reveals that her mother is in town and has become a burden. Frasier suggests that she should start dating Martin to get her out of the house. So they agree to \"accidentaly\" meet at McGinteys.\nSCENE TWO - MCGINTEYS\nMartin, Frasier and Niles are seated at a table as the waitress; Bonny comes over. She seems to know Martin. After greeting him she realises who Frasier is and talks about how proud Martin is of him. Then she turns to Niles and thinks he's a friend. Martin covers up saying \"I've told you about my other son\". However Bonny still gets it wrong and calls him Eddie. After she's left, some people from the Shang-ri-la enter who Niles trys to hide from. However they spot and proceed to play fight calling him the coyote. Niles explains his\nnickname: It went from Niles to Niley to Nile. E. Coyote and then just to coyote. However at that moments it's refined further as the shang-ri-la guys address him with a coyote growl. After this Roz and her mother, Joanna, enter. Frasier notices her and pretends he didn't expect her. He gets them to sit at the table - with Joanna next to Martin.\nSCENE THREE - MCGINTEYS LATER\nEveryone has finished eating however Martin & Joanna are the only ones who have cleared their plates. They explain how they never worried about calories in their day and how they ate full cooked breakfasts. Niles is disturbed by this. Roz suggests to Joanna that they better leave as they have a jazz concert. However, Frasier stops her and tells Roz they must discuss the promos. This was obviously planned as Roz decides to give her ticket to Martin so the two \"love birds\" can go off together. Joanna and Martin agree as Niles, Frasier and Roz leave saying that they have no idea it was a set up. However we see that they do know.\nSCENE FOUR - FRASIER'S APARTMENT\nDaphne and Frasier are watching a \"Miss. World\" pagent whilst eating popcorn. Roz comes in looking worried, she explains her worry to Frasier. However he's not really listning to her as he watches her pagent making sarcastic comments with Daphne about the women. Roz explains how her mother MUST BE perfect, she says SHE NEVER makes wrong choices. Roz explains how Martin isn't right for her. Frasier is angered by this as he believes Roz thinks her mother is too high up to be dating someone as low down as retired cop. They begin arguing as Daphne trys to watch the television. Daphne gets up in a huff saying she just missed something before storming off to her room. Frasier tells Roz to stop worrying just before they hear the front door opening. Roz and Frasier quickly head to the sofa to look at the promos, as if they had been doing that all the time.\nMartin and Joanna enter looking pleased with each other. They make little comments and it seems they want to see each other again. Joanna leaves so Martin can tell his TRUE side of the story to Frasier. Martin says that he actually hated the date. He says she droned on and on with boring facts; eg: the egg production in Wisconsin. Martin heads off to the room with the words \"If you ever set me up on a date again, I'll kill you in your sleep!\" Frasier is shocked by this and rather distressed.\nFrasier rushes to the door, it's Roz. She looks really excited and explains how her mother had such a good time. Joanna cannot wait for a second date. Roz also says how a wall has been broken down between her and her mother. She says she will now talk openly about how she felt when her father left. She really is exstatic. At this point Martin walks out saying \"her voice is still in my head\". Frasier cannot bring himself to tell her that Martin hated the date and says \"it's like a fairytale here too!\"\nACT TWO\nSCENE ONE - CAFE NERVOSA\nNiles and Frasier are at the bar. Niles takes a drink from his cappuchino and he puts it down in disgust. He says that each week there gets more foam and less coffee. He decides to tell the waiter, however when he realises the waiter is a bit too macho for him he changes his mind and looks for the suggestion box. Frasier tells him about Martin's date and not being able to tell Roz. Niles tell Frasier he must do the right thing and tell the truth.\nRoz enters and begins talking to Frasier. She says Martin hasn't rung yet. Frasier again can't bring himself to say anything so instead says he will. Roz looks at her calender and checks it with Frasier. He makes excuses up for every day. So Roz suggests that she brings Joanna up on Sunday to their super bowl party, which Frasier has no way of escaping out of.\nShe leaves and Frasier tells Niles the news, and that he must also be at the superbowl party. Niles gives Frasier some advice: to tell Martin about this five minutes before. If he tells him in advance he'll probably escape to McGinteys. So Frasier decides this is probably the best option in the long run.\nSCENE TWO - FRASIER'S APARTMENT\nMartin is watching the warm up before the superbowl on the television and Frasier swims around laying out food. The doorbell sounds and he takes Martin aside. He says it will be Joanna which just angers Martin. He answers the door, surprisingly, to Bonny who is carrying some food. She makes her way to the kitchen as Martin explains that he invited her over in order to ask her on a date. Frasier is distraught by this as he answers the door to Joanna. Joanna and Martin begin chatting before they take the baby away to a room.\nBonny then enters laying the food out and Roz inquires about why she's here. Frasier pretends that Martin invited her here for Niles. Bonny is confused by this. At this point Niles enters through the front door and hangs up his coat. He is shocked when he realises that Bonny is his date however he goes along with it to be polite. Daphne enters at this point and heads out the door - she explains she's going to see \"Whuthering Heights\" at the cinema by herself. She goes onto say how, if there was someone there, she would only end up crying in her dates shoulder.\nAfter sampling one of Bonny's culinary \"delights\" he enters the kitchen. Martin enters just after him. Niles tells him off for setting him up with Bonny. Martin tells Niles he invited her here for himself, and that it was probably Frasier's idea so not to offend \"Miss. Snoozey\". Frasier enters the kitchen and tells them to see to the dates however Niles & Martin disagree saying they hate them.\nThey all enter the room where Joanna begins talking about the baby. Bonny asks to see the baby, so Martin takes her off. Unfortunately the baby monitor is switched on and the conversation about the dates are heard. Both Martin and Bonny don't like their dates. Upon hearing this, Niles takes flight in order to catch up with Daphne at the movies.\nJoanna is a little disturbed by this but says she's not too offended. She leaves without saying goodbye to Martin. Roz follows her after shouting at Frasier.\nSCENE THREE - FRASIER'S APARTMENT\nLater on, Roz comes back up to his apartment and they talk about looking at their parents love life and comparing it with their own. They explain that they'll probably never get married and time is runnung out. Frasier says they should make a pact; like in forty years if they find no one they should marry each other. Roz says she was going to say \"kill each other\".\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNiles is writing out a suggestion about the foam to put in the suggestion box. However, the waiter stands over him so he decides to screw it and throw it in the bin. Niles makes a run for it whilst the waiter just stares at him.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The text is a summary of the episode \"Frasier's First Date\" from the television series Frasier. In the episode, Frasier and Niles are trying to get Martin to go on a date with a woman named Joanna. However, Martin is reluctant to go on a date and is instead trying to avoid it.

In the end, Frasier and Niles make a pact to marry each other if they are still single in forty years.</s>【我为群众办实事】“我为群众办实事”实践活动—— 市妇联开展“巾帼心向党 奋斗新征程” 主题宣讲活动"

Meets up with Melanie]\nMelanie: Why are you late?\nRebecca: You're not going to like the answer.\nMelanie: I already know the answer.\nRebecca: I missed the bus.\nMelanie: I don't doubt it, no bus stops near Brad's. You spent the night, the alarm didn't work. Or maybe it did.\nRebecca: I didn't sleep with him.\nMelanie: Girl, there's...[Interrupted]\nRebecca: I missed the bus!\nMelanie: There's something either very wrong with you, or there's something very wrong with him.\nRebecca: There's nothing wrong with him.\nMelanie: Please tell me you know that for a fact.\nRebecca: Melanie, I gotta go.\nMelanie: You're lying aren't you?\nRebecca: I wouldn't lie to you. [Turns to class of 5 year olds] Good morning guys!\nClass: Good morning Miss Rebecca!\nRebecca: Everybody's in their seats?\nClass: Yes!\nRebecca: Ok, Sidney, why don't you tell us what you did this weekend. Come on, Sidney, we know you're not shy.\nSidney: How come we always have to tell you what we did, and you never tell us what you did?\nClass: [giggles]\nRebecca: Ok, I had a really great weekend, but you can't tell Miss Melanie, ok?\nSidney: What did you do?\nRebecca: I made a new friend. It's so much fun to make new friends, isn't it?\nClass: Yeah, Yes, etc.\nGirl 2: Did you tell you mom and dad about your new friend?\nRebecca: Absolutely! You should never keep anything from your parents. And I told them [gibberish]\nClass: [giggles]\nRebecca: Wh..\nClass [more giggles]\nRebecca: [gibberish]\nClass: [Laughs and giggles]\n[Rebecca goes to the board and starts writing]\nClass: C, A, T, H\nSidney: \"The.\"\nBoy: We know that word, \"the.\"\n[Rebecca collapses, on the board the words \"call the nurse\" are written]\n(Evil commercials...bane of my existence!)\n[House and Wilson are walking through the hallway. All you can see is their hands and legs, showing that House is using a cane and limping. Wilson is the only one of the two wearing a lab coat.]\nWilson: 29 year old female, first seizure one month ago, lost the ability to speak. Babbled like a baby. Present deterioration of mental status.\nHouse: See that? They all assume I'm a patient because of this cane.\nWilson: So put on a white coat like the rest of us.\nHouse: I don't want them to think I'm a doctor.\nWilson: You see where the administration might have a problem with that attitude.\nHouse: People don't want a sick doctor.\nWilson: Fair enough. I don't like healthy patients. The 29 year old female...\nHouse: The one who can't talk, I liked that part.\nWilson: She's my cousin.\nHouse: And your cousin doesn't like the diagnosis. I wouldn't either. Brain tumor, she's gonna die, boring.\nWilson: No wonder you're such a renowned diagnostician. You don't need to actually know anything to figure out what's wrong.\nHouse: You're the oncologist; I'm just a lowly infectious disease guy.\nWilson: Hah, yes, just a simple country doctor. Brain tumors at her age are highly unlikely.\nHouse: She's 29. Whatever she's got is highly unlikely.\nWilson: Protein markers for the three most prevalent brain cancers came up negative.\nHouse: That's an HMO lab; you might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set.\nWilson: No family history.\nHouse: I thought your uncle died of cancer.\nWilson: Other side. No environmental factors.\nHouse: That you know of.\nWilson: And she's not responding to radiation treatment.\nHouse: None of which is even close to dispositive. All it does is raise one question. Your cousin goes to an HMO?\nWilson: Come on! Why leave all the fun for the coroner? What's the point of putting together a team if you're not going to use them? You've got three overqualified doctors working for you. Getting bored.\n[Cut to Rebecca, into the nose, and up the blood stream. Cut to House looking through an MRI of Rebecca's head.]\nForeman: It's a lesion.\nHouse: And the big green thing in the middle of the bigger blue thing on a map is an island. I was hoping for something a bit more creative.\nForeman: Shouldn't we be speaking to the patient before we start diagnosing?\nHouse: Is she a doctor?\nForeman: No, but...\nHouse: Everybody lies.\nCameron: Dr. House doesn't like dealing with patients.\nForeman: Isn't treating patients why we became doctors?\nHouse: No, treating illnesses is why we became doctors, treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable.\nForeman: So you're trying to eliminate the humanity from the practice of medicine.\nHouse: If we don't talk to them they can't lie to us, and we can't lie to them. Humanity is overrated. I don't think it's a tumor.\nForeman: First year of medical school if you hear hoof beats you think \"horses\" not \"zebras\".\nHouse: Are you in first year of medical school? No. First of all, there's nothing on the CAT scan. Second of all, if this is a horse then the kindly family doctor in Trenton makes the obvious diagnosis and it never gets near this office. Differential diagnosis, people: if it's not a tumor what are the suspects? Why couldn't she talk?\nChase: Aneurysm, stroke, or some other ischemic syndrome.\nHouse: Get her a contrast MRI.\nCameron: Creutzfeld-Jakob disease.\nChase: Mad cow?\nHouse: Mad zebra.\nForeman: Wernickie's encephalopathy?\nHouse: No, blood thiamine level was normal.\nForeman: Lab in Trenton could have screwed up the blood test. I assume it's a corollary if people lie, that people screw up.\nHouse: Re-draw the blood tests. And get her scheduled for that contrast MRI ASAP. Let's find out what kind of zebra we're dealing with here.\n[Cut to House standing at the elevator, he sees Cuddy and presses the down button twice]\nCuddy: I was expecting you in my office 20 minutes ago.\nHouse: Really? Well, that's odd, because I had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago.\nCuddy: You think we have nothing to talk about?\nHouse: No, just that I can't think of anything that I'd be interested in.\nCuddy: I sign your paychecks.\nHouse: I have tenure. Are you going to grab my cane now, stop me from leaving?\nCuddy: That would be juvenile.\n[Both enter the elevator]\nCuddy: I can still fire you if you're not doing your job.\nHouse: I'm here from 9 to 5.\nCuddy: Your billings are practically nonexistent.\nHouse: Rough year.\nCuddy: You ignore requests for consults.\nHouse: I call back. Sometimes I misdial.\nCuddy: You're 6 years behind on your obligation to this clinic.\nHouse: See, I was right, this doesn't interest me.\nCuddy: 6 years, times 3 weeks; you owe me better than 4 months.\nHouse: It's 5:00. I'm going home.\nCuddy: To what?\nHouse: Nice.\nCuddy: Look, Dr. House, the only reason that I don't fire you is because your reputation still worth something to this hospital.\nHouse: Excellent, we have a point of agreement. You aren't going to fire me.\nCuddy: Your reputation won't last up if you don't do your job. The clinic is part of your job. I want you to do your job.\nHouse: Well, like the philosopher Jagger once said, \"You can't always get what you want.\"\n[Scene of hospital from above, cut to hallway, Rebecca in wheelchair with Cameron, Chase, and Foreman around.]\nRebecca: You're not my doctor. Are you Dr. House?\nChase: Thankfully no. I'm Dr. Chase.\nCameron: Dr. House is the head of diagnostic medicine. He's very busy, but he has taken a keen interest in your case.\n[Cut to MRI room, Rebecca is on the table]\nForeman: We inject gadolinium into a vein. It distributes itself throughout your brain and acts as a contrast material for the magnetic resonance imagery.\nCameron: Basically, whatever's in your head, lights up like a Christmas tree.\nForeman: It might make you feel a little light-headed.\nNurse: Dr. Cameron. I'm sorry I have to stop you, there's a problem.\n[Cut to House, busting into Cuddy's office]\nHouse: You pulled my authorization.\nCuddy: Yes, why are you yelling?\nHouse: No MRIs, no imaging studies, no labs.\nCuddy: You also can't make long distance phone calls.\nHouse: If you're gonna fire me at least have the guts to face me.\nCuddy: Or photocopies; you're still yelling.\nHouse: I'm ANGRY! You're risking a patient's life.\nCuddy: I assume those are two separate points.\nHouse: You showed me disrespect, you embarrassed me and as long as I'm still work here you have...[interrupted]\nCuddy: Is your yelling designed to scare me because I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be scared of. More yelling? That's not scary. That you're gonna hurt me? That's scary, but I'm pretty sure I can outrun ya.\nCuddy: Oh, I looked into that philosopher you quoted, Jagger, and you're right, \"You can't always get what you want,\" but as it turns out \"if you try sometimes you get what you need.\"\nHouse: So, because you want me to treat patients, you aren't letting me treat patients.\nCuddy: I need you to do your job.\n[House comes out of Cuddy's office; Wilson and the ducklings are there]\nHouse: Do the MRI, she folded. [Ducklings leave, House turns to Wilson] I've gotta do four hours a week in this clinic until I make up the time I've missed. 2054. I'll be caught up in 2054. [He walks into the clinic] You better love this cousin a whole lot.\n[Cut back to MRI room Rebecca is back on the table. She is pushed into the machine.]\nCameron: All right Rebecca, [over intercom] we know you may feel a little claustrophobic in there, but we need you to remain still.\nChase: [over intercom] Ok, we're gonna begin.\n[Machine starts up and makes weird sounds]\nRebecca: I don't feel so good.\nChase: It's all right. Just try to relax.\n[Rebecca starts choking. Cool shot of inside her throat. You can see that it closes up]\nCameron: Rebecca? [over intercom] Rebecca? [back in booth] Rebecca! Get her out of there.\nChase: Ah she probably fell asleep; she's exhausted.\nCameron: She was claustrophobic 30 seconds ago, she's not sleeping. We gotta get her out of there!\nChase: It'll just be another minute.\nCameron: She's having an allergic reaction to gadolinium. She'll be dead in two minutes.\nForeman: Hold her neck.\nCameron: Oh, she's ashen.\nForeman: She's not breathing. Epi point five.\nCameron: Come on, I can't ventilate.\nForeman: Too much edema, where's the surgical airway kit?\nChase: Yep, coming.\n[Cool cutting into Rebecca's neck sounds, and real colored blood for a change. They get her bagged.]\nChase: Good call.\n(And we're back to commercials...blah...)\n[Cut into hospital room, next day. Rebecca has a ventilator hooked up to her, and the ducklings are present]\nChase: We'll get that tube out of your throat later today.\nCameron: Just get some rest for now.\n[They leave to hallway, House is there.]\nHouse: Told you, can't trust people.\nCameron: She probably knew she was allergic to gadolinium, figured it was an easy way to get someone to cut a hole in her throat.\nHouse: Can't get a picture, gonna have to get a thousand words.\nForeman: You actually want me to talk to the patient? Get a history?\nHouse: We need to know if there's some genetic or environmental causes triggering an inflammatory response.\nForeman: I thought everybody lied?\nHouse: Truth begins in lies. Think about it.\nForeman: That doesn't mean anything,does it?\n[House walks away]\n[House enters the clinic...dun dun dun!]\nHouse: 12:52 PM Dr. House checks in, please write that down. Do you have cable TV here somewhere? General Hospital starts in 8 minutes.\nCuddy: No TV, but we've got patients.\nHouse: Can't you give out the aspirin yourself? I'll do paperwork.\nCuddy: I made sure your first case was an interesting one.\nHouse: Cough just won't go away, runny nose looks a funny color.\nCuddy: Patient admitted complaining of back spasms.\nHouse: I think I read about something like that in the New England Journal of Medicine.\nCuddy: Patient is orange.\nHouse: The color?\nCuddy: No, the fruit.\nHouse: You mean yellow; it's jaundice.\nCuddy: I mean orange.\nHouse: Well, how orange?\nCuddy: Exam room 1.\n[Cut to House in exam room 1 with Orange Guy]\nOrange Guy: I was playing golf and my cleat got stuck. I mean, it hurt a little but I kept playing. The next morning I could barely stand up. Well, you're smiling so I take it that means this isn't serious.\n[House takes out his pills]\nOrange Guy: What's that? What are you doing?\nHouse: Painkillers.\nOrange Guy: Oh, for you, for your leg.\nHouse: No, 'cause they're yummy. You want one? It'll make your back feel better.\n[Guy nods and House gives him a painkiller]\nHouse: Unfortunately, you have a deeper problem. Your wife is having an affair.\nOrange Guy: What?!\nHouse: You're orange, you moron! It's one thing for you not to notice, but if your wife hasn't picked up on the fact that her husband has changed color, she's just not paying attention. By the way, do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and mega-dose vitamins?\n[Guy nods]\nHouse: The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red. Get some finger-paints and do the math. And get a good lawyer.\n[House leaves the room]\n[Cut to House in another exam room, this time with a little boy]\nHouse: Deep breath.\nLittle boy: It's cold.\nHouse: Has he been using his inhaler?\nMother: Not in the past few days. He's, um, only ten. I worry about children taking such strong medicine so frequently.\nLittle boy: What happened to your leg?\n[After saying this the little boy starts to wheeze a little, and continues throughout the entire time that House is talking.]\nHouse: Your doctor probably was concerned about the strength of the medicine, too. She probably weighed that danger against the danger of not breathing. Oxygen is so important during those prepubescent years, don't you think? Ok, I'm gonna assume that no body's ever told you what asthma is, or if they have, you had other things on your mind. A stimulant triggers cells in your child's airways to release substances that inflame the air passages and cause them to contract. Mucus production increases, cell-lining starts to shed. But the steroids, the steroids...stop the inflammation. The more often this happens...[trails off and starts to leave the room]\nMother: What? \"The more often this happens...\"what?\"\nHouse: Forget it. If you don't trust steroids, you shouldn't trust doctors.\n[House leaves]\n[Cut to Rebecca's room]\nRebecca: My mother passed away three years ago. She had a heart attack, and my father broke his back doing construction.\n[Cameron's pager goes off]\nCameron: It's House, it's urgent. I'm sorry.\n[They go outside the room and see House waiting for them there]\nCameron: You couldn't have knocked?\nHouse: Steroids. Give her steroids, high doses of prednisone.\nForeman: You're looking for support for a diagnosis of cerebral vasculitus.\nCameron: Inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain is awfully rare. Especially for someone her age.\nHouse: So is a tumor. Her SED rate was elevated.\nForeman: Mildly.\nCameron: That could mean anything, or nothing.\nHouse: Yeah, I know. I have no reason to think that it's vasculitus except that it could be.\nIf the blood vessels were inflamed that's gonna look exactly like what we saw on the MRI from Trenton County, and the pressure's gonna cause neurological symptoms.\nCameron: You can't diagnose that without a biopsy.\nHouse: Yes, we can, we treat it. If she gets better we know that we're right.\nCameron: And if we're wrong?\nHouse: We learn something else.\n[Cut to overview of hospital, and then back into Rebecca's room]\nRebecca: Why steroids?\nChase: Just part of your treatment. You haven't had many visitors. No boyfriend?\nRebecca: Three dates. I wouldn't have stood by him if her were vomiting all day.\nChase: Well, what abut work? You must have friends from work.\nRebecca: Pretty much everybody I like is 5 years old. A nurse said you're stopping my radiation.\nChase: We're just trying some alternative medications. So, where's your family from then?\nRebecca: Steroids aren't an alternative to radiation.\nChase: The tests weren't really conclusive.\nCameron: We're treating you for vasculitus, it's the inflammation of blood vessels in the brain.\nRebecca: It's not a tumor? I don't have a tumor?\n[Cut to hallway with Cameron and Chase]\nChase: You should have told her the truth. It's a long shot guess.\nCameron: [to nurse] Thank you. [To Chase] If House is right, no harm, if he's wrong we've given a dying woman a couple days hope.\nChase: False hope.\nCameron: If there was any other type available I would have given her that.\n[Cut to classroom where Foreman is smelling the floor]\nSidney: Why are you smelling Billy's pants?\nForeman: I'm not.\nSidney: Looked like you were.\nForeman: I was smelling the floor.\nSidney: Oh.\nForeman: Do you have any pets in this class?\nSidney: No, but we used to have a gerbil, but Carly L. dropped a book on it.\nForeman: Careless.\nSidney: Do you need to smell it?\nForeman: No, I'm smelling for mold. I don't need to smell it.\nSidney: You can smell our parrot.\nForeman: You said you didn't have any pets in this class.\nSidney: A parrot is a bird.\n[Cut to House and Foreman eating lunch with some Soap on the TV that has House's attention more than Foreman does]\nForeman: Parrots are the primary source of psitticosis.\nHouse: It's not the parrot.\nForeman: Psitticosis can lead to nerve problems and neurological complications.\nHouse: How many kids were there in the class?\nForeman: 20.\nHouse: How many are home sick?\nForeman: None, but...\nHouse: None, but you think that 5 year olds are more serious about bird hygiene than their teacher. You've been through her home?\nForeman: She lives in Trenton. I can go up to her room tomorrow morning and ask her for the key.\nHouse: Would the police call for permission before dropping by to check out a crime scene?\nForeman: It's not a crime scene.\nHouse: Far as I know she's running a Meth Lab out of her basement.\nForeman: She's a kindergarten teacher!\nHouse: And if I was a Kindergarten student I would trust her implicitly. [Sigh] Ok, I'll give you a for instance. The lady back there, who made your egg-salad sandwich. Her eyes look glassy, did you notice that? Now hospital policy is to stay home if you're sick, but if you're making $8.00 an hour, then ya kinda need the $8.00 an hour right? The sign in the bathroom says that employees must wash after using the facilities, but I figure that somebody who wipes snot on a sleeve isn't hyper concerned about sanitary conditions. So what do ya think? Should I trust her? I want you to check the patient's home for contaminants, garbage, medication...[interrupted]\nForeman: Whoa, oh, I can't just break into someone's house.\nHouse: Isn't that how you got into the Felker's home? [pause] Yeah, I know, court records are sealed, you were 16, it was a stupid mistake, but your old gym teacher has a big mouth. You should write a thank you note.\nForeman: I should thank him?\nHouse: Well, I needed somebody around here with street smarts. Ok? Knows when you're being conned, knows how to con.\nForeman: I should sue you!\nHouse: I'm pretty sure you can't sue somebody for wrongful hiring.\nForeman: But I'm pretty sure I can sue if you fire me for not breaking into some lady's house.\n[Foreman eats the rest of the sandwich]\n[Cut to House sitting and reading \"Spring's hottest people' Magazine, Cuddy walks in]\nHouse: I'm doing research. People are fascinating aren't they?\nCuddy: Why are you giving Adler steroids?\nHouse: Well, she's my patient that's what you do with patients. You give them medicine.\nCuddy: You don't prescribe medicine based on guesses. At least we don't since Tuskeegee and Mengele.\nHouse: You're comparing me to a Nazi? Nice.\nCuddy: I'm stopping the treatment.\nHouse: She's my patient.\nCuddy: It's my hospital.\nHouse: I did not get her sick, she is not an experiment, I have a legitimate theory about what's wrong with her.\nCuddy: With no proof.\nHouse: There's never any proof. 5 different doctors come up with 5 different diagnoses based on the same evidence.\nCuddy: You don't have any evidence. And nobody knows anything huh? Then how is it that you always assume you're right?\nHouse: I don't, I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption. And why are you so afraid of making a mistake?\nCuddy: Because I'm a doctor. Because when we make mistakes people die.\n[She walks off up the stairs]\nHouse: Come on.\n[House thinks about going up the stairs, but decides against it]\nHouse: People used to have more respect for cripples you know! [Turns to a guy in a wheelchair] They didn't really.\n[Cut to Cuddy entering Rebecca's room. Rebecca is eating voraciously.]\nCuddy; So, how ya feeling?\nRebecca: Much better, thanks. Are you Dr. House? I thought he was a he, but...?\nCuddy: No. Don't eat too much too fast.\nRebecca: Thank him for me.\nCuddy: Right.\n[Cuddy exits the room, and House is standing there, Cuddy is a bit surprised by him standing there.]\nHouse: Should I discontinue the treatment, boss?\nCuddy: You got lucky.\n[She walks off]\nHouse: Cool, huh?\n[Cut to the outside of the hospital, and back into Rebecca's room, it's now night and Wilson is there]\nWilson: Ok, once again.\n[Rebecca takes a deep breath]\nWilson: Good.\nRebecca: Am I ever gonna meet Dr. House?\nWilson: [scoffs] Well, you might run into him at the movies or on the bus.\nRebecca: Is he a good man?\nWilson: He's a good doctor.\nRebecca: Can you be one without the other? Don't you have to care about people?\nWilson: Caring's a good motivator. He's found something else. [Has Rebecca grab his hands] Feel this?\nRebecca: umhmm\nWilson: How about this?\nRebecca: umhmm\nWilson: Ok squeeze. [Pause] Harder. All right.\nRebecca: He's your friend, huh?\nWilson: Yeah.\nRebecca: Does he care about you?\nWilson: I think so.\nRebecca: You don't know?\nWilson: As Dr. House likes to say, \"Everybody lies.\"\nRebecca: It's not what people say, it's what they do.\nWilson: [Pause] Yes, he cares about me.\nRebecca: I can't see. [Pause] I can't see.\n[She starts having a seizure and monitors go crazy]\nWilson: A little help in here!\n[Flat line on the heart monitor]\n(Commercial, again, evil!)\n[Cut back to Rebecca's room, daytime, she has an oxygen mask on. Foreman is there]\nForeman: Your chest will be sore for a while. We needed to shock you to get your heart going. Ok. [He lays a bunch of cards with pictures on them in front of Rebecca] Can you arrange these to tell a story?\n[cut to pictures and then to House's office]\nForeman: She couldn't put them in order.\nChase: Could the damage have been caused by a lack of oxygen during her seizure?\nForeman: No, I gave her the same test 5 minutes later and she did just fine. The altered mental status is intermittent, just like the verbal skills.\nCameron: So, what now?\nForeman: Given the latest symptoms it's clearly growing deeper into the brain stem. Soon she won't be able to walk, she'll go blind permanently, and then the respiratory center will fail.\nHouse: How long do we have?\nForeman: If it's a tumor we're talking a month, maybe two, if it's infectious a few weeks, if it's vascular that'll probably be fastest of all, maybe a week.\nHouse: We're gonna stop all treatment.\n[House gets up and walks over to the drinks.]\nForeman: I still think it's a tumor. I think we should go back to the radiation.\nChase: She didn't respond to the radiation.\nForeman: Well, maybe we didn't see the effects until we started steroids.\nHouse: No, it's not a tumor. The steroids did something, I just don't know what.\nForeman: So we're just gonna do nothing? We're just gonna watch her die?\nHouse: Yeah, we're gonna watch her die. Specifically we're gonna watch how fast she's dying. You just told us, each diagnosis has its own timeframe. When we see how fast it's killing her we'll know what it is.\nCameron: And by then maybe there's nothing we can do about it.\nForeman: There's go to be something we can do, something better than watching her die.\nHouse: Well, I got nothing. How 'bout you?\n[Cut to hallway, Foreman and Cameron exit the office]\nForeman: b*st*rd. [Turns to Cameron] Oh, Cameron, I need you for a couple of hours.\nCameron: What's up?\nForeman: When you break into someone's house; it's always better to have a white chick with you.\nCameron: Adler's house? Why don't we just ask her for a key?\nForeman: For all we know she could be running a meth lab out of her basement.\n[Cut to clinic and House is with a patient, a guy]\nGuy: I'm tired a lot.\nHouse: Any other reason you think you may have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?\nGuy: It's kinda the definition isn't it?\nHouse: It's kinda the definition of getting older.\nGuy: I had a couple headaches last month, mild fever, sometimes I can't sleep, and I have trouble concentrating.\nHouse: Apparently not while researching this stuff on the internet.\nGuy: I was thinking it also might be fibromyalgia.\nHouse: [Looks contemplative, and then serious] Excellent diagnosis [sarcastic]!\nGuy: Is there anything for that?\nHouse: [heavy sigh] Ya know, I think there just might be.\n[House goes out of the room, and to the dispensary.]\nHouse: I need 36 Vicodin, and change for a dollar.\nNurse: (jumbled, I can't tell)\n[House gets his change and goes to a candy machine. He gets white candies out of the machine, and goes back to the counter. There he takes the Vicodin and slips them into his pocket, exchanging them for the candy.]\nHouse: Exam room 2. [Places the bottle back on the counter.]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Cut to Cameron and Foreman in Rebecca's house]\nCameron: House doesn't believe in pretense. Figures life's too short and too painful. So he just says what he thinks.\nForeman: Nothing interesting in the garbage. \"I say what I think\" is just another way of saying \"I'm an ass.\"\nCameron: Well, if you wanted to be judged on your medical prowess only, maybe you shouldn't have broken into someone's home.\nForeman: I was 16! Don't know about ticks, but her dog's definitely got fleas.\nCameron: I managed to make it to 17 without a criminal record.\n[Foreman is in the fridge, and takes out some ham and mustard]\nForeman: Yeah? Well you obviously didn't grow up in my neighborhood.\nCameron: That's right. You stole a loaf of bread to feed your starving family right? You always eat during break-ins?\nForeman: Am I supposed to respect their food more than I respect their DVD players? You want some?\nCameron: No.\nForeman: You gonna go hungry until she dies?\nCameron: No.\nForeman: You know what, after centuries of oppression, decades of civil rights marches, and more significantly living like a monk, never getting less than a 4.0 GPA, you don't think it's kind of disgusting I get one of the top jobs in the country because I'm a delinquent? We'll eat, then we'll tear up the carpet.\nCameron: You went to Hopkins right?\nForeman: Yep.\nCameron: So, you went to a better school than I did, got better grades than I did.\nForeman: So how'd you get the job? Did you stab a guy in a bar fight?\n[Off Cameron's face, a little disturbed]\n[Cut to the hospital exterior, daytime, then into House's office again]\nForeman: Nothing.\nHouse: It's not a tumor; she's getting worse too fast. She can't stand up.\nWilson: No toxins, no medication?\nForeman: Nothing that would explain these symptoms.\nWilson: Family history of neurological problems?\nForeman: Not that I could tell from her underwear drawer.\nHouse: You said nothing that would explain these symptoms. What did you find that doesn't explain these symptoms?\nForeman: Dr. Wilson convinced you to treat this patient under false pretenses. Adler's not his cousin.\nWilson: That's ridiculous. You can ask her yourself. Can we get back to... [interrupted]\nForeman: She's not Jewish!\nWilson: Rachel Adler's not Jewish?\nForeman: I had ham at her apartment!\nWilson: [chuckles] Dr. Foreman, a lot of Jews have non-Jewish relatives, and most of us don't keep kosher. I can see getting through high school without learning a thing about Jews, but medical school...\nForeman: Ok, maybe she's Jewish, but she's definitely not your cousin.\nWilson: Really? This guy's...he...\nForeman: You don't even know her name! You called her Rachel; her name is Rebecca!\nWilson: Yes, yes, her name is Rebecca. I call her Rachel.\n[While this is going on House is very quiet and you can almost see that he is putting things together}\nHouse: You idiot!\nWilson: Hey...listen...\nHouse: Not you, him! You said you didn't find anything.\nForeman: Everything I found was in [interrupted]\nHouse: You found ham.\nForeman: So?\nHouse: Where there's ham there's pork, where there's pork there's neurocysticercosis.\nChase: Tapeworm?! You think she's got a worm in her brain?\nHouse: It fits. Could have been living there for years, it never occurred to me [interrupted]\nCameron: Millions of people eat ham every day. It's quite a leap to think that she's got a tapeworm.\nHouse: OK, Mr. Neurologist. What happens when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm?\nForeman: They, they get a little better and then they get worse.\nWilson: Just like Rebecca Adler did.\n[Cut out and then in again, House has a book and lays it on the table, open to a page on tapeworms]\nHouse: In a typical case if you don't cook pork well enough you ingest live tapeworm larvae. They got these little hooks they grab onto your bowel, they live, they grow up, they reproduce.\nChase: Reproduce? There's only got one lesion, and it's nowhere near her bowel.\nHouse: That's because this is not a typical case. Tapeworm can produce 20 to 30,000 eggs a day. Guess where they go.\nForeman: Out.\nHouse: Not all of them. Unlike the larvae, the egg can pass right through the walls of the intestines and into the blood stream. And where does the blood stream go?\nCameron: Everywhere.\nHouse: As long as it's healthy the immune system doesn't even know it's there. The worm builds a wall, uses secretions to shut down the body's immune response and control fluid flow. It's really kinda beautiful.\nForeman: As long as it's healthy, so what do we do? Call a vet and nurse the little guy back to health?\nHouse: It's too late for that. It's dying, and as it dies this parasite loses the ability to control of the host's defenses. The immune system wakes up and attacks the worm and everything starts to swell, and that is very bad for the brain.\nWilson: It could still be a hundred other things. The eosinophil count was normal.\nChase: It's only abnormal in 30% of cases.\nWilson: Proving nothing.\nHouse: No, no, no, no, you see, it fits, it's perfect! It explains everything.\nWilson: But it proves nothing.\nHouse: I can prove it by treating it.\nWilson: No, you can't. I was just with her, she doesn't want any more treatments, she doesn't want any more experiments, she wants to go home and die.\n(Commercials! Gah! I wish commercials would go home and die!)\n[Cut back into Rebecca's room, it's nighttime and House enters]\nHouse: [To nurse] Will you excuse us, please?\n[Nurse leaves]\nHouse: I'm Dr. House.\nRebecca: It's good to meet you.\nHouse: You're being an idiot. Ahem. [Pause] You have a tapeworm in your brain, it's not pleasant, but if we don't do anything you'll be dead by the weekend.\nRebecca: Have you actually seen the worm?\nHouse: When you're all better I'll show you my diplomas.\nRebecca: You were sure I had vasculitus too. Now I can't walk and I'm wearing a\ndiaper. What's this treatment gonna do for me?\nHouse: I'm not talking about a treatment; I'm talking about a cure. But because I might be wrong, you want to die.\nRebecca: What made you a cripple?\nHouse: I had an infarction.\nRebecca: A heart attack?\nHouse: It's what happens when the blood flow is obstructed. If it's in the heart it's a heart attack. If it's in the lungs it's a pulmonary embolism. If it's in the brain it's a stroke. I had it in my thigh muscles.\nRebecca: Wasn't there something they could do?\nHouse: There was plenty they could do, if they made the right diagnosis, but the only symptom was pain. Not may people get to experience muscle death.\nRebecca: Did you think you were dying?\nHouse: I hoped I was dying.\nRebecca: So you hide in your office, refuse to see patients because you don't like the way people look at you. You feel cheated by life so now you're gonna get even with the world. You want me to fight this. Why? What makes you think I'm so much better than you?\nHouse: When you're scared, you'll turn into me.\nRebecca: I just want to die with a little dignity.\nHouse: There's no such thing! Our bodies break down, sometimes when we're 90, sometimes before we're even born, but it always happens and there's never any dignity in it. I don't care if you can walk, see, wipe your own ass. It's always ugly, always. [Pause] You can live with dignity, we can't die with it.\n[Cut to hallway, outside the room, looks like daytime, but it could be the lights in the hospital.]\nHouse: No treatment.\nForeman: Maybe we can get a court order, override her wishes. Claim she doesn't have the capacity to make this decision.\nHouse: But she does.\nCameron: But we could claim that the illness made her mentally incompetent.\nForeman: Pretty common result.\nHouse: That didn't happen here.\nWilson: He's not gonna do it. She's not just a file to him anymore. He respects her.\nCameron: So because you respect her, you're going to let her die?\nHouse: I solved the case, my work is done.\n[House starts to walk away]\nHouse: Patients always want proof, we're not making cars here, we don't give guarantees.\n[House continues walking, Off Chase]\nChase: I think we can prove it's a worm. It's noninvasive, it's safe. I'm not completely sure but...[interrupted]\nHouse: Yeah, yeah, yeah what's the damn idea?\nChase: Have you ever seen a worm under an x-ray, a regular old no contrast 100-year-old technology x-ray? They light up like shotgun pellets. Just like on a contrast MRI.\nForeman: Which is the same thing as a CT scan, which we did, which proved nothing.\nHouse: Worm cysts is the same density as the cerebrospinal fluid, we're not going to see anything in her head, but Chase is right, he's right, we should x-ray her, but we don't x-ray her brain, we x-ray her leg, worms love thigh muscle. If she's got one in her head I guarantee you there's one in her leg.\n[Cut to x-ray table, Rebecca is on it, and they focus on her leg, x-ray is taken.]\nChase: Hold still, Rebecca.\n[...And the worm shows up. Cut to Rebecca's hospital room, day.]\nChase: This here is a worm larva. [Chase pointing to x-ray of her leg]\nRebecca: So, if it's in my leg, it's in my brain?\nChase: Are you looking for a guarantee? It's there, probably been there 6 to 10 years.\nRebecca: Could I have more?\nChase: Probably. It's good news.\nRebecca: What do we do now?\nChase: Now we get you better. Albendazole.\n[Hands her a cup with two pills in it.]\nRebecca: Two pills?\nChase: Yeah, every day for at least a month with a meal.\nRebecca: Two pills?\nChase: Yeah, possible side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, headache, dizziness, fever, and hair loss. We'll probably make you keep taking the pills even if you get every one of those.\n[Rebecca smirks, and then downs the pills]\n[Cut to House's office, day. Cameron's there waiting as House enters.]\nCameron: Why did you hire me?\nHouse: Does it matter?\nCameron: Kinda hard to work for a guy who doesn't respect you.\nHouse: Why?\nCameron: Is that rhetorical?\nHouse: No, it just seems that way because you can't think of an answer. Does it make a difference why I think I'm a jerk? The only thing that matters is what you think. Can you do the job?\nCameron: You hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record.\nHouse: No, it wasn't a racial thing, I didn't see a black guy. I just saw a doctor...with a juvenile record. I hired Chase 'cause his dad made a phone call. I hired you because you are extremely pretty.\nCameron: You hired me to get into my pants?!\nHouse: I can't believe that that would shock you. It's also not what I said. No, I hired you because you look good; it's like having a nice piece of art in the lobby.\nCameron: I was in the top of my class.\nHouse: But not THE top.\nCameron: I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic.\nHouse: Yes, you were a very good applicant.\nCameron: But not the best?\nHouse: Would that upset you, really, to think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty not some genetic gift of intelligence?\nCameron: I worked very hard to get where I am.\nHouse: But you didn't have to. People choose the paths that gain them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort. That's a law of nature, and you defied it. That's why I hired you. You could have married rich, could have been a model, you could have just shown up and people would have given you stuff. Lots of stuff, but you didn't, you worked your stunning little ass off.\nCameron: Am I supposed to be flattered?\nHouse: Gorgeous women do not go to medical school. Unless they're as damaged as they are beautiful. Were you abused by a family member?\nCameron: No!\nHouse: Sexually assaulted?\nCameron: No.\nHouse: But you are damaged, aren't you?\n[Cameron hesitates, and in that moment her pager goes off]\nCameron: I have to go.\n[She leaves, cut to orange guy (not so orange now) in with Cuddy]\nOrange guy: I followed her. I couldn't stop thinking about what that doctor said.\nCuddy: I told you not to listen to him, he's an idiot.\nOrange guy: I was ORANGE.\nCuddy: I don't want to know what you found out.\nOrange guy: You don't care?\nCuddy: I'm your doctor, you've been good to me and good to this hospital, of course I care, but I don't see how this conversation can end well for me. Either your wife is having an affair, or she's not having an affair and you have come here because you rightly think I should fire him, but I can't even if it cost me your money, the son of a bitch is the best doctor we have.\n[Cut to his finger, now missing his ring]\n[Cut to Rebecca's room, Chase enters]\nChase: Feeling any better?\nRebecca: I can't complain.\nChase: As you know the hospital has certain rules, and as you also know we tend to ignore them, but I think this one's gonna be a little obvious unless we get your help.\n[Cameron enters with Rebecca's class]\nCameron: If anyone asks, you have 11 daughters and 5 sons.\nRebecca: Hi, you guys!\nClass: Hi!\nRebecca: Come here!\n[They gather around her bed and present her with a card.]\nRebecca: It's so good to see you guys! I missed you! Is this for me?\n[Rebecca opens it and inside it says \"Miss Rebecca we're glad you're not dead\"]\nRebecca: Oh, I love you guys. [To Chase and Cameron] I wanted to thank Dr. House, but he never visited again.\nCameron: He cured you, you didn't cure him.\nRebecca: [Talking to class] Ok, I want a hug and a kiss from every single one of you. Get up here right now!\nClass: [Giggles, and laughs]\n[They get up on the bed with Rebecca]\n[Cut to House watching General Hospital (I assume)]\nFemale Dr. on mini TV: There.\nMale Dr on mini TV: Hold on.\nFemale Dr. on mini TV: She's converted.\nHouse: You said she was your cousin. Why would you lie?\nWilson: It got you to take the case.\nHouse: You lied to a friend to save a stranger, you don't think that's screwed up?\nWilson: You've never lied to me?\nHouse: I NEVER lie.\nWilson: Oh, really.\nMale Dr on mini TV: Why do we do this?\nFemale Dr. on mini TV: Because we're doctors, when we make mistakes people die.\n[House gets a great little smirk here, re: Cuddy using the same line earlier]\n[Knock on the door]\nNurse: Dr. House? You have a patient.\n[Nurse pulls the blinds away to reveal the guy that House gave the candy pills to.]\nNurse: He says he needs a refill.\nHouse: Got change for a dollar?\n[Cut to outside the hospital and aerial view of the campus.]\nSinging: \"No, you can't always get what you want.\" \"You can't always get what you want.\"\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.\nHoward: How is this helpful?\nSheldon: All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.\nLeonard: But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as. It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.\nSheldon: True.

I don't suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.\nBernadette: Right here.\nPenny: Ah, You guys are the best.\nAmy: What's with the clothes?\nPenny: Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.\nAmy: I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what's this?\nPenny: That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.\nBernadette: Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.\nPenny: What kind of teenager did you think I was?\nBernadette: Slutty.\nAmy: Easy.\nPenny: The word is popular.\nBernadette: How was your prom? Did you go?\nAmy: No, but I was on clean-up crew.\nPenny: Aw, that's sad.\nAmy: No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.\nBernadette: My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me 'cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.\nAmy: Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.\nPenny: Doesn't matter. Prom is silly anyways.\nBernadette: Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.\nPenny: No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.\nAmy: My date would've had to clean that up.\nBernadette: Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.\nAmy: Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.\nBernadette: Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.\nPenny: Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who's been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.\nAmy: You went to seven proms?\nPenny: Yeah, let's see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ The apartment ]\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey, where's Bernadette?\nHoward: She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.\nRaj: Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I've wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I'm back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing's been a real roller coaster.\nHoward: Bernie's really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.\nRaj: Did you go to your prom?\nSheldon: No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms...\nPenny: Okay, okay.\nShldon: ...of AP Calculus.\nRaj: How come you're not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?\nLeonard: Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?\nPenny: Well, who cares what I think?

This is so exciting. Isn't this exciting?\nHoward: Yep.\nBernadette: Look, even Stuart's bringing a date. I wonder who it is.\nHoward: You know exactly who it is. He's gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?\nBernadette: Because he's our friend, and you two need to get along. And why can't he take your mom? You took her to your prom.\nHoward: I didn't take her, she was a chaperone.\nBernadette: I saw a picture of you two dancing together.\nHoward: What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can't take this anymore.\nStuart (on phone): Hello.\nHoward: Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It's making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you're bringing my mother to a party I'm going to? What the hell?\nStuart: I'm not bringing your mother, I have a date.\nHoward: Oh, so now you're cheating on my mother?\nStuart: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about?

(Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny: You knocked more than usual.\nSheldon: Next time I might be in a rush, it's good to have a few in the bank.\nPenny: Okay, what's up?\nSheldon: I'd like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I've come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.\nPenny: Great, how?\nSheldon: We pretend we're aliens. I'm not the best at reading facial cues, but I'm gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\nPenny: Okay, just one question. What?\nSheldon: My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I've used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don't worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.\nPenny: Here's a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?\nSheldon: There are post-prom mating rituals?\nPenny: Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.\nSheldon: Well, if it's part of the prom experience, then I'm open to it.\nPenny: You're kidding.\nSheldon: I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I'm not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you're a little turned on.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ The apartment ]\nLeonard: You know, if you're not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons.\nSheldon: Bruce Wayne doesn't wear a clip-on.\nLeonard: Bruce Wayne doesn't make his roommate tie it for him.\nSheldon: His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.\nLeonard: There, perfect.\nSheldon: What, are you sure? It's my first prom, I want to do it correctly.\nLeonard: I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.\nSheldon: I was, but Penny didn't want to. You didn't want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn't want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.\nLeonard: Was that a flask?\nSheldon: Yes. I've decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.\nLeonard: You're gonna put alcohol in the punch?\nSheldon: Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It's all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.\nLeonard: If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you'd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?\nSheldon: Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren't elected. It's gonna be off the hook.\nLeonard: And while you're at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having s*x doesn't mean you have to.\nSheldon: Why would you say that?\nLeonard: You know, 'cause, 'cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.\nSheldon: Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?\nLeonard: Just relax, it's a joke. You don't have hormones.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Penny's apartment ]\nLeonard: Wow, you look amazing.\nPenny: Thank you, so do you.\nAmy: Sheldon, you look so handsome.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: Sheldon, doesn't Amy look hot? That's got to put some starch in the upper flermin.\nAmy: What's that?\nLeonard: Oh, it's a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you're dancing.\nSheldon: Excuse me.\nAmy: Where are you going?\nSheldon: I can't do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn't grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck.\nLeonard: He's right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ A limo ]\nRaj: Ooh, I'll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we're close.\nBernadette: That's a neat tattoo.\nEmily: Oh, thanks, it's Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.\nBernadette: Aw, that movie's so cute.\nHoward: Do you like her because you both have red hair?\nEmily: Uh, a little, but more that she's covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.\nBernadette: I like Cinderella.\nEmily: Did you know, in the original book, the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper?\nBernadette: I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.\nRaj: Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.\nEmily: Oh, she's cute.\nHoward: Oh, my God.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: That's Jeanie.\nBernadette: That's Jeanie?\nEmily: Who's Jeanie?\nHoward: Don't say it.\nRaj: That's Howard's cousin that he had s*x with.\nHoward: She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don't say it.\nEmily: No, it's okay. He told me that story a long time ago.\nHoward: Raj.\nRaj: It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ The rooftop ]\nPenny: Oh, it's beautiful.\nLeonard: Oh, the girls really did a nice job.\nPenny: Aw, I know I wasn't into this before, but I'm so glad I get to take you to your first prom.\nLeonard: What makes you think I didn't go to my prom? I went.\nPenny: Well, who'd you go with?\nLeonard: I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.\nPenny: Aw.\nLeonard: Oh, it's all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so...\nPenny: Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would've asked you to dance.\nLeonard: No, you wouldn't have.\nPenny: Well, you don't know that.\nLeonard: It was before my growth spurt.\nPenny: What, that already happened?\nLeonard: Very funny.\nPenny: Well, you wouldn't have asked me either.\nLeonard: I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Sheldon's bedroom ]\nAmy: Sheldon, can I come in?\nSheldon: I don't think that's a good idea.\nAmy: Why not?\nSheldon: According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.\nAmy: You're making me worry. What's going on?\nSheldon: What's going on is we're about to go to a prom. And there's a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.\nAmy: What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?\nSheldon: It's not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I'm not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.\nSceme: The limo.\nStuart: So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys'. She passed me the Manischewitz, I took one look at this punim, and I almost plotzed on the kugel.\nRajj: Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?\nHoward: So, my mother's okay with this?\nJeannie: Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?\nHoward: 'Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.\nJeannie: Weirder than what you and I did in my dad's Corolla?\nRaj: This is so messed up.\nEmily: I know, I'm having the best time.\nHoward: Why would you even come to this? Didn't you know I'd be here?\nJeannie: It was a long time ago, Howard.\nStuart: And you're only second cousins, who cares?\nBernadette: So, you knew and you brought her anyway?\nStuart: Oh, so she's good enough for Howard, but not for me?\nHoward: Yeah.\nBernadette: Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf.\nHoward: Yeah.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ The rooftop ]\nPenny: Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.\nLeonard: There's no music.\nPenny: I don't care. We'll make our own music.\nLeonard: My God, who's the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.\nPenny: Thank you for wearing your heels.\nLeonard: Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.\nPenny: Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?\nLeonard: I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.\nPenny: I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ The limo ]\nBernadette: Howie, get off of him.\nHoward: Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Sheldon's bedrooom ]\nAmy: Sheldon, this is silly. I'm not missing another prom. I'm going upstairs now. Good-bye.\nSheldon: I really did think you looked pretty.\nAmy: You did?\nSheldon: Yes. So much so that I started to panic.\nAmy: Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn't mean we have to spend the night together.\nSheldon: Were you hoping we would because it's prom?\nAmy: I'm always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.\nSheldon: Thank you for understanding.\nAmy: Of course I understand. Sheldon, there's something else I've been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don't have to say it back. I know you're not ready, and I don't want you to say it just because social convention dictates...\nSheldon: I love you, too.\nAmy: You said it.\nSheldon: There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what's happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn't mean girls are allowed in my room.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ The rooftop ]\nRaj: Okay. Here we go... Say \"Cheese\"! Say \"Cheese\"! Say \"Cousin\"! Say...\nStuart: Oh, sorry. Hang on, sorry. (On phone) Hey, Debbie. I, yeah, yeah, I'm here with Jeanie. Okay, but we're just friends. It's, yeah. I got to go.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

It's harmless.\nMax: It's just not a very nice thing to do.\n(Isabel leaves, Max yells after her.)\nMax: Stay away from Liz, please.\n(He continues flipping through channels)\nMax: Crap. . .Crap. . .Crap. . .\n(Isabel is on her bed looking through her yearbook and stops at Liz's picture. We enter Liz's dream at the Crashdown. A young man enters.)\nBrad: Hello, Liz.\nLiz: Hello, Brad.\n(Brad lifts her up, and sets her on the counter. Liz lies down.)\nLiz: Would you like fries with that.\n(Brad and Liz start kissing. Max shows up behind the counter)\nLiz: I'm with Brad now.\nMax: Brad doesn't even exist. Besides, you want someone who can do this.\n(Max gestures toward the ceiling and rose petals start to fall. Liz and Max kiss.)\nLiz: Oh my!\nIsabel: Even her romantic dreams are boring.\n(Back to Isabel's room. She looks through the yearbook again and stops on Kyle.)\nIsabel: Kyle's got to be more interesting than that.\n(We enter Kyle's dream. He's on a mountaintop in a Lotus position with BUDDHA.)\nBuddha: Remember young blossom, my most important words.\nKyle: Yes, master.\nBuddha: To thine own self be true.\nIsabel: It's Shakespeare.\nBuddha: With every inhale find the center of yourself. With every exhale release the ties that bind your energy. Inhale. . .Exhale. . .Inhale. . .\n(BUDDHA is interrupted by a cell phone beeping.)\nBuddha: Excuse me. BUDDHA here. Yeah. When? Prepare the ship. Standby to beam us aboard.\nKyle: Master?\nBuddha: Our enemies have arrived, Kyle. We must leave Earth and face the dark legion.\nKyle: No, no, no, no. I'm here for inner peace, not that science fiction crap.\nBuddha: Max Evans changed you when he saved your life. You know that. You're an alien now Kyle. Dude, like, accept you destiny.\nKyle: No, I'm not!\n(Kyle looks down at his hand and it has become green and slimy.)\nKyle: Ahhhhh!\n(Switch back to Isabel's room, where she enters another dream in a forest with flashes of light.)\nIsabel: Where am I? Kyle, who's dream is this?\n(We see a man dragging a screaming girl in a black plastic bag. Isabel wakes up in a panic.)\n(Opening credits)\n(Open on Sheriff Valenti's office, the next morning.)\nVoice (O.C.): Excuse me. I'm looking for a broken-down, old, war-horse somehow managed to make Sheriff of Roswell, New Mexico.\nValenti: Hansen, send that sanctimonious paper-pusher in here before I have him arrested for vagrancy.\n(Man enters)\nDan: Damn son, you are getting old.\nValenti: Real police work will do that to you, Dan. You should try it some time.\nDan: Now, that hurts. Long time, Jimbo.\nValenti: Too long. So, I take it this isn't a social call.\nDan: The state police board wants to review the Hubble shooting. VALENTI: Hubble? Well, it's an open and shut case. Crazy old man with a gun in the desert. It was over a year ago. Why investigate that?\nDan: Wheels of justice grind slowly.\nValenti: Do I need a lawyer?\nDan: Whoa, easy, no need to get all riled up now.\nValenti: That was a clean shoot, Dan.\nDan: If you say so.\n(Change to Crashdown. Tess is having breakfast with Kyle. She pours Tabasco sauce on her waffles with whip cream and strawberries, and in her orange juice.)\nKyle: That's a very alien thing, isn't it? The very sweet, very spicy? TESS: Uh huh.\nKyle: Can I try a bite?\nTess: You won't like it.\nKyle: Oh, I hope not.\n(Kyle takes a taste)\nKyle: Oh my God.\nTess: I told you.\nKyle: No,no,no. It's not completely horrible. It's almost tasty.\nTess: Oh well, here. Have some more.\nKyle: No, no, I can't. This is so wrong. I'm not ready for this.\nTess: Not ready for what?\nKyle: For the change. Not ready to be, like, a half-human, half-alien freakazoid.\nTess: Uh, we prefer the term 'hybrids'.\nKyle: I'm serious. Look, I never bargained for this. One minute I'm a normal guy with my whole life ahead of me the next thing I know, Max Evans transmogrifies me into something not-of-this-Earth.\nTess: Whoa, whoa, trans-what?\nKyle: Look, I never asked for this.\nTess: Well, I suppose he could have let you die. Is that what you want? KYLE: If I had died, I would have transcended the mortal plane and been reincarnated into the next stage of my life.\nTess: Reincarnated as what, exactly?\nKyle: Like, just another person or animal, maybe.\nTess: An animal? Like, you could have ended up a gopher or something! KYLE: Look, we're getting off the point. I really need some help.\nTess: What do you want from me? I don't know what's going to happen to you. You know, maybe nothing will happen. Or maybe you could develop superpowers and start flying all over Roswell in a big cape. I don't know!\n(Kyle reaches for Tess' waffles.)\nKyle: Could I have another-\nTess: No!\n(Isabel and Max are talking to Sheriff Valenti in his office.)\nValenti: Alright, let me get this straight. You can go into people's dreams?\nIsabel: Yes. But usually I choose whose dreams I go into. This one just came to me.\nValenti: Well, how do you know this was real, not just somebody's nightmare you stumbled into?\nIsabel: I don't know, but it felt real. She needs help.\nMax: Sheriff, when Tess was being tortured Isabel got flashes from her, and that's how she knew Tess was in danger. That's how we saved her life. We should check into this.\nValenti: It's a little hard to look for a missing girl without a name or a face.\n(Dan knocks and enters)\nDan: Hey, Senor Chows for lunch?\nValenti: Yeah, that'd be fine.\n(Dan looks with interest at Max and Isabel.)\nDan: Hi.\nMax: Hi.\nValenti: I'll see you at 1:00, Dan.\n(Dan exits)\nMax: Who was that?\nValenti: From the State Police Board. He's reviewing the Hubble case. Max: Hubble?\nValenti: It's no big deal. Dan's an old friend. I'll tell you what. I'll look into it, Okay?\nIsabel: Thank you.\n(Dan and Valenti are having lunch at Senor Chows.)\nValenti: When I ordered him to put his weapon down, he uh. . . he refused, brought the gun up. I felt my life was in imminent danger, so I fired.\nDan: Hmm, just like it says in your report. (Dan signals a waiter) Uh, could we have more of these sweet and sour tortillas? They're good, different, but good. So, uh, who were those kids in your office this morning?\nValenti: Nobody. Stolen bike.\nDan: Hmm, What were their names again?\nValenti: Max and Isabel Evans. DAN: Max Evans. . .hmm, I got a statement here says that Hubble was last seen in a car with Max Evans, before the shooting.\nValenti: Whose statement?\nDan: Was Max Evans there that night?\nValenti: No.\nDan: Okay Jim, that's all I need to hear.\n(Move to the Crashdown. Liz is serving food to some customers)\nLiz: Okay, Umm, we have a Saturn Rings and a Galaxy Sub, hold the Max. (Liz looks at Maria as she realizes her mistake) Okay, so I'll be right back with the Cokes.\n(Maria pulls Liz aside.)\nMaria: Okay, what just happened?\nLiz: I need help. I'm sick, Okay. I am an obsessed person.\nMaria: Okay, is this a general freakout or should I be concerned?\nLiz: No, I have Max on my brain 24 hours a day. Okay, I dream about him, I think about him, and now I'm saying his friggin' name without even realizing it. What am I going to do?\nMaria: You're in love that's all.\nLiz: I know, but it's not getting me anywhere.\nMaria: Okay relax, relax, Liz. It's not that bad. I promise.\nLiz: Not that bad? Really? Why don't you look at this?\n(Liz pulls out two pictures of Max from her apron pockets.)\nLiz: See! Obsession, obsession, obsession, obsession!\nMaria: Okay, okay, you're a Max-aholic. I'm here for you. What can I do?\nLiz: Get me a life.\n(a new guy enters the Crashdown.)\nMaria: Oh, you gotta be kidding me. When did you get out?\nSean: This morning.\nMaria: You didn't break out did you?\nSean: I got a release, good behavior.\nMaria: That's a first. You don't think that you're going to stay with us do you?\nSean: Oh, uh, Aunt Amy already gave it the thumbs up.\nMaria: She is such a soft touch, isn't she?\nSean: Hi, Liz.\nLiz: Hey, Sean.\nSean: All grown up. Like it. I'll see you at home.\nMaria: It's not your home.\n(Evans House. Grant Sorenson is flipping through TV channels as Max walks in with a look of distrust.)\nMax: Grant.\nGrant: Hey, Max.\nMax: You're uh. . .\nGrant: Waiting for Isabel.\nMax: Oh, right. I'll go check on her.\n(Max enters Isabel's room. Isabel is hurriedly going through her closest of clothes picking out something to wear.)\nMax: You know, Grant's downstairs.\nIsabel: I know.\nMax: Do you really like that guy?\nIsabel: Don't start with me, Max.\nMax: What's wrong?\nIsabel: I just. . .I've been thinking about that girl all day. You know? It was different. It was like she was dreamwalking me.\nMax: You mean, like, she's an alien?\nIsabel: No, no, I don't think so.\nMax: Well, maybe you should cancel your date.\nIsabel: You know how many times I have cancelled in the last month? I have no more excuses.\nMax: Well, tell him the truth. You've been battling evil aliens for control of the planet and it's hard to fit him in.\nIsabel: Funny. No, no, I want a normal date with a normal guy tonight. I'm going, so just. . .just tell him I'll be ready in five minutes. Okay? Five minutes.\nMax: Five minutes.\nIsabel: Yeah, five minutes. Okay? Thank you.\n(Valenti living room. Kyle is sitting in front of the TV, which is off. He tries out his alien powers by raising his hand toward the screen. Tess walks up behind him and sees what he is doing, so she picks up the remote control and turns the TV on.)\nKyle: Oh God, jeez.\n(Tess laughs quietly to herself and Kyle tries again.)\nKyle: Channel 15.\n(Tess changes the channel with the remote.)\nKyle: Channel 23\n(Tess changes the channel)\nKyle: Unscrambled p0rn.\n(Tess changes again, and Kyle jumps up in triumph.)\nKyle: I have become -\n(he turns and sees Tess behind him.)\nKyle: an idiot.\nTess: Oh, but a cute one. Hey\n(Tess tosses the remote to Kyle)\n(Switch to the movies with Isabel and Grant. Isabel rolls her head from side to side.)\nGrant: You sore?\nIsabel: Yeah.\n(Grant massages her neck.)\nIsabel: Thank you.\n(Isabel lays her head on Grant's shoulder and closes her eyes. Suddenly she gets another flash of a young blond girl being kidnapped as she goes to her car. We see drugs and a syringe. Next we see her being dragged in a black bag, by a man. Isabel sits up with a yell.)\nGrant: You okay?\nIsabel: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm sorry.\n(Isabel and Max are in Valenti's livingroom later that night.)\nIsabel: I need to find her. She's in trouble. She's going to die.\nValenti: I thought you weren't sure.\nIsabel: It's real Sheriff. I know it's happening.\nMax: You have to find her.\nValenti: Find who? What missing girl? No one's been reported. I don't know what she looks like. I don't have any leads. . .\nIsabel: I saw her car. It's silver.\nValenti: Did you see the plates?\nIsabel: No, but it's a Honda, or a Toyota, or something. I'm not good with cars.\nValenti: Okay, I guess I could start looking through the abandoned vehicle reports. See if it's turned up. Okay?\nIsabel: Thank you. I'm sorry for barging in like this.\nValenti: Hey, hey. It's Okay, alright?\nIsabel: Thank you.\n(As Isabel leaves Max talks to the sheriff.)\nMax: I know how all this must look.\nValenti: I believe her. I do. I just don't know how realistic it is to think that I'm going to be able to find this girl with this evidence.\nMax: I know. Thanks.\n(As Max leaves the sheriff makes a phone call.)\nValenti: Hansen, I'm coming in.\n(Valenti enters the Crashdown on his way in to the station and sits at the counter by a woman.)\nValenti: Large coffee and a warp wrap to go please.\nJudith Foster: Working late Jim?\nValenti: Yep\nJudith Foster: Great match your boy had the other night.\nValenti: Yeah, two take downs. Not bad, huh?\nJudith Foster: Just like his father. Remember that match against the Rangers?\nValenti: My God, how do you remember these things?\nJudith Foster: I had a crush on you, or didn't you notice?\nValenti: I noticed your boyfriend.\nJudith Foster: I like to call him my husband now.\nValenti: How's your girl?\nJudith Foster: Melissa? Fine, just fine. . . I think.\nValenti: Something wrong?\nJudith Foster: No, it's nothing I'm sure. She went to visit some friends in Santa Fe yesterday and she hasn't called home yet. I know I shouldn't be concerned, but she always calls. Oh, I'm being silly.\nValenti: Melissa drives a silver car doesn't she?\nJudith Foster: Yeah, Toyota. Why?\n(Sheriff's station later that night. A deputy is interviewing the woman as Sheriff Valenti enters giving orders.)\nValenti: You contacted all the Foster girl's friends yet? I need to know if she turns up.\nDeputy: OKAY\n(Valenti turns to another officer.)\nValenti: Get highway patrol on the horn. I want every inch of 285 covered.\n(Valenti hands papers to another officer)\nValenti: Plate numbers. Run them.\n(Switch to Mrs. Foster being interviewed)\nMrs. Foster: She had an overnight bag and a cosmetics case. Deputy: Does she have a cell phone?\nMrs. Foster: No. I took it away from her. She was spending too much money.\n(Dan enters)\nDan: Hey, how's it going?\nValenti: Busy. Judith, you have that picture?\nMrs. Foster: Yeah, it's right here.\n(Valenti turns back to Dan.)\nValenti: What's up?\nDan: Heard about the missing girl. You're really circling up the wagons here.\nValenti: Just doing my job. Excuse me.\n(Valenti opens his office door.)\nDan: Who you got in there?\n(Valenti turns back and looks at Dan but doesn't answer, then continues into his office and closes the door. Max and Isabel are waiting. He hands Isabel a picture of Melissa Foster.)\nValenti: Is this her?\nIsabel: The hair's the right color. I think so.\nValenti: Are you sure?\nIsabel: I never saw her clearly, but it's her. It has to be.\nValenti: I hope you're wrong. I've known the Fosters for years.\nMax: Well, I don't recognize her.\nValenti: She goes to Goddard High.\nIsabel: The terror. I felt it so clearly in the last dream. We have to get her back. I need to.\nValenti: You and me both.\n(Change to the next day in the Crashdown where Maria is serving Sean.)\nMaria: In case I haven't told you this. You dine n' dash here, you die.\n(Sean reaches into his pocket and lays money on the table.)\nMaria: Is there a tip in there?\nSean: Just give me the burger.\nMaria: How about a little talk, hmmm? Alright, in our house there are rules, and as strange, unimaginable, and bizarre as it may seem - we live our lives by these very simple rules.\nSean: Okay.\nMaria: Rule one, toilet seat is left down. Rule two, underwear are not left on the floor, no. Rule three, milk is poured into a glass, not directly consumed by the carton. Rule four -\nSean: There a lot of these rules?\nMaria: Don't worry, I'll write them down for you, assuming of course, that you can read.\nSean: Of course.\nMaria: Now, pay attention please. Rule four is very important. Leave Liz alone.\nSean: Why, is she part of that house too or something?\nMaria: I am not kidding, Sean. She is way off limits to you. Okay? Way, way, off limits.\nSean: Way.\nMaria: Look, I saw the way you looked at her, alright? 'All grown up. I like it' No, it's not going to happen, Sean.\nSean: Okay.\nMaria: She's in a very delicate and fragile place in her life right now.\n(We hear Liz yelling off camera)\nLiz: Dammit Eddie, where's my order?\n(Sean looks questioningly at Maria)\nMaria: I'm serious.\nSean: I hear you, alright? Leave her alone. I get it. What do you want from me?\nMaria: I'll give you the list by the end of the day.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Switch to Isabel in her room. She lies on her bed and tries to dreamwalk. After some restless tossing she sees the blond girl again being dragged in the forest. This time we see the face of the man and it is Grant Sorenson. Isabel wakes up very upset and Max is shaking her.)\nIsabel: No! Oh, no! It can't be!\nMax: You started crying Isabel. What happened?\nIsabel: No, Oh God! It's Grant! It's Grant. I saw him. I saw him. Oh God! Oh God. No.\n(Change to Valenti's Office, where Isabel and Max are talking to the Sheriff.)\nValenti: Sorenson?\nIsabel: I'm positive.\nValenti: Alright, I'll take care of it.\nMax: You want us to help?\nValenti: Not this time.\n(Switch to a daytime shot of a golf course. Valenti is calling to a judge who is playing golf.)\nValenti: Your honor! Your honor!\nJudge: Hello, Sheriff.\nValenti: The woman who came forward is positive she saw Grant Sorenson with Melissa Foster.\nJudge: You have a history with this Sorenson character don't you? Uh, he filed a complaint?\nValenti: That was a misunderstanding, sir.\nJudge: Yeah, you searched his room without a warrant, shoving a gun in his face.\nValenti: Your honor! Your honor! A girl could be dying here!\nJudge: You hurry and get me probable cause, then you'll get your warrant; otherwise, you're ruining my handicap.\n(Change to Grant Sorenson's campsite as The Sheriff and Hansen drive up.)\nValenti: Check the car. We're looking for a large vinyl bag; seven foot by three.\nGrant: What the hell's going on here?\nValenti: We need to do a little looking around Mr. Sorenson.\nGrant: For what? My igneous rock collection?\nValenti: Do you know Melissa Foster?\nGrant: I heard she was. . . What is this? Every time someone disappears I become your number one suspect?\nValenti: What were you doing last Friday night?\nGrant: I drove to Carlsbad. That's the opposite direction from Santa Fe. VALENTI: How did you know Miss Foster went to Santa Fe?\nGrant: It's common knowledge. The whole town is talking. Sherrif, you got a warrant?\nValenti: What were you doing in Carlsbad?\nGrant: I went to pick up some equipment.\nValenti: We heard you were out here in the middle of the night.\nGrant: That's not a crime.\nValenti: Depends upon what you were doing.\n(Valenti comes to Grant's tent and opens the flap. He sees a large black vinyl bag like the one in Isabel's visions, and pulls it out.)\nGrant: Don't touch that.\nValenti: What are you doing with this bag?\nGrant: Transporting equipment.\nValenti: I need to see what's inside it. Open it up.\nGrant: I can't do that.\nValenti: Well if you won't then I will. Step aside.\nGrant: Sheriff, this is ridiculous.\nValenti: Back off!\n(Grant moves aside and the sheriff unzips the bag to find equipment.)\nValenti: What is this?\nGrant: It's equipment, photosensitive equipment. They use it in caverns like in Carlsbad. That's why I work at nights. It's the only time to get proper readings. You don't have a warrant do you?\n(Switch to Valenti's office where Dan is waiting for him.)\nValenti: Dan.\nDan: Okay, cards on the table, Jimbo. What's going on here?\nValenti: I'm in the middle of an investigation.\nDan: Where you been the last four hours?\nValenti: Following a lead. Checking out a suspect. Anymore questions? DAN: Yeah, you get a warrant for Sorenson this time?\nValenti: You always know more than you let on, don't you Dan. I should have remembered that the day you walked through my door.\nDan: It's part of my job, Jimbo, and what I know right now is you disappear for days on end and you spend a lot of time lately with teenage kids. That's awful strange behavior.\nValenti: This isn't about the Hubble case is it? What the hell is going on here?\nDan: The State Board has had you in their watch file for a long time now, what with your reputation for chasing UFO's and what not. But right now it's your own men that are talking, and they want to know what's happened to their sheriff.\nValenti: I don't owe them an explanation.\nDan: You owe me!\n(Valenti and Dan start yelling at the same time.)\nDan: You're crossing a lot of lines and I want to know why!\nValenti: I haven't been able to carry on an investigation. A girl's life is on the line.\n(The two men are interrupted by a knock on the door.)\nValenti: What!\nHansen: Uh, Sheriff. I'm sorry but, uh. .\n(Hansen shows a young blond girl into Valenti's office.)\nDan: Can we help you?\nGirl: Yeah, hi. I'm Melissa Foster. I heard you were looking for me.\n(Switch to an alley outside the Sheriff's station where Valenti is talking to Max and Isabel.)\nValenti: Girl said her car gave out halfway to Santa Fe. Next day she had it towed. No kidnapper, no needles, no bags and no desert.\n(Isabel hangs her head.)\nValenti: Isabel, it's alright. Melissa's safe. Her family's happy. Nobody got hurt.\nMax: What about you?\nValenti: I'll have some awkward questions to answer but I'm sure it will blow over.\nIsabel: Sheriff, I am so sorry. I don't know how I could have been so wrong. I . . .\nValenti: Hey, you didn't do anything wrong. You have gifts the rest of us don't, and I trust those gifts. And if anything like this ever happens again, I want you to come to me. I'll be fine.\n(Back in Valenti's office where Dan and the Judge are questioning him.)\nJudge: What the hell is wrong with you? You conduct an illegal search after I say no!\nDan: You know, Sorenson has filed a 15 million-dollar civil suit against the city.\nValenti: For what? Because I ruined his stupid experiment? He's gonna be laughed out of court.\nJudge: I'm half tempted to have you thrown into your own jail on a contempt citation.\nValenti: I'm sorry. Okay, I was wrong. I had a hunch. I had to follow it. JUDGE: A hunch! You told me you had a witness!\nDan: You told Judith Foster you had two witnesses! You terrified that family! I spent all day trying to calm them down.\nValenti: There are two witnesses, but I promised them anonymity. I can't break that promise.\nDan: We talking about those kids again.\nValenti: No\nJudge: What kids?\nDan: Max and Isabel Evans.\nValenti: This has nothing to do with them.\nJudge: Then who? I want names and I want them now.\nValenti: I'm sorry.\nJudge: Best find yourself a lawyer.\n(Later that night in Isabel's room, where Max is talking to Isabel.)\nMax: Isabel, I don't understand this. You've never been wrong about this in the past and we've always gone with your judgement.\nIsabel: I don't understand it either, Max. This wasn't something that I planned.\nMax: How could this happen.\nIsabel: I don't know.\nMax: Valenti might be losing his job because of us. Have you thought about that?\nIsabel: Of course I have, but what was I suppose to do? Just let her die?\nMax: There is no missing girl, Alright! Your dreams were wrong. You were wrong.\nIsabel: Don't' you think I know that? Maybe part of me just needed her to be missing.\nMax: What do you mean?\nIsabel: After everything we've been through, after all the pain that we've caused, I just wanted what we are, what I am, to do something good for a change.\nMax: Isabel, you are my sister. You yell at me, you second-guess me, and you piss me off. You also saved my life, and I don't care what we've been through; I still believe in you. I always will. Go get some sleep. You look. . . really bad.\nIsabel: Thanks!\n(Change to Crashdown same night. Liz, Maria, and Michael are working and Kyle is sitting at the counter. Sean enters.)\nKyle: Tess is openly mocking me now. This morning I woke up with little antennae coming out of my head.\nLiz: I don't know what to say. We need professional help.\nSean: Yo, M.\nMaria: M? No, see um. . . in the real world we use names. My name is Maria.\nKyle: Who's that?\nMichael: Maria's loser cousin Sean.\nSean: Can I get some fries, tough guy?\nMichael: No\nMaria: Sorry, we're closed. So sorry.\nKyle: Anyway, the point is, I'm just saying It's gonna be OK. I mean we're both obsessed people but we'll get through it. At least we have each other.\nLiz: You know, uh, I think the fryer is still warm. I could whip you up some fries.\nSean: Nah, forget it. I'll scrounge something up at home.\n(Sean exits.)\nMaria: It's not your home. Stop calling it that. You're just passing through. You're not actually thinking. . .\nLiz: No, of course not.\nMaria: All I try and do is help. Does anybody listen?\nLiz: I'm sorry, what were you saying?\nKyle: Nothing. I was just talking to myself. Hey, you got any cousins for me?\n(Change to Isabel in bed, same night. She has another vision. She sees more details of where the girl is.)\nIsabel: Where am I?\nKidnapped Girl: No, please don't!\nIsabel: Max, Max! No, Max. . . Max!\n(Attacker takes out a syringe. Isabel screams and begins reacting like the kidnapped girl.)\nIsabel: Help me!\n(Max enters, sits on Isabels bed and tries to wake her.)\nMax: I'm here. Isabel, Isabel wake up.\nIsabel: No, please! Don't do this. You don't have to do this. No!\n(Isabel wakes up)\nMax: Isabel, are you alright?\nIsabel: Oh my God.\n(Move to Valenti's office the same night. Dan enters.)\nDan: Judith Foster is filing a grievance with the State police board. She wants a formal investigation into you actions.\nValenti: I wonder who put that idea in her head?\nDan: Lot a questions here, Jimbo. Time for you to start thinkin' of some answers.\nValenti: Talk to my lawyer.\n(Phone rings)\nValenti: Sheriff Valenti.\nMax: It's not over.\nValenti: You wanna explain that to me.\nMax: It's not Melissa Foster. It's some other girl. She's in Fraizer Woods in the clearing outside the abandoned pump house. We have to go right now.\n(Valenti pauses and looks up at Dan.)\nMax: Sheriff?\nValenti: Where are you now Deputy?\nMax: We're at our house. We'll meet you on Clark's street, near the Crashdown.\nValenti: Stay where you are. I'll take care of it.\nMax: No, we're going with you. Can you meet us?\nValenti: Yeah, I'll meet you there deputy.\n(The Sheriff hangs up.)\nDan: Do deputies always call you on your private line?\nValenti: I'll talk to you in the morning.\nDan: You know your Daddy went down just like this. Got some fool notion into his head, ignored the law and his friends, and ended up handing over his badge.\nValenti: Is that a threat?\nDan: If that phone call was from those kids, consider it a warning.\n(Move to Frazier Woods. Max, Isabel, and Valenti are searching with flashlights.)\nIsabel: This is it.\nMax: Ok, we're here. Now what?\nIsabel: I don't know. I don't know. She's here. She's here somewhere. VALENTI: You kidnap a girl. You bring her out here and then you. . . Max: What is it?\nValenti: It's a molehill.\nMax: So?\nValenti: It's an awfully straight line for a molehill.\n(Valenti reaches down and finds a tube. He pulls it up and follows along it until he comes to a strange apparatus.)\nValenti: Oxygen tanks\nIsabel: Oh my God.\nValenti: Come on.\n(Valenti follows the tube back the other direction until it finally disappears deep into the ground.)\nIsabel: Oh God, she's under here.\n(They dig frantically with their hands. We see someone watching them through the cross hairs of a gun scope.)\nMax: Watch the head.\nIsabel: Oh my God.\n(They unearth a clear plastic box around the buried girl's head.)\nIsabel: What did they do to her?\nMax: I don't know.\nValenti: She's going into shock.\nIsabel: We've got you. What did they do?\nMax: Isabel, can you get this thing off?\nIsabel: Yes.\nValenti: Hurry, Hurry. Get it off.\n(The rifleman shoots and hits the ground near them. Max jumps up and puts up his protective shield. Valenti pulls out his gun and aims toward where the shots came from. The masked man fires again, but the bullet bounces off the shield.)\nMax: Isabel, hurry!\n(Isabel tries to lift the box off the girl's head while another bullet bounces off Max's shield.)\nValenti: Max, I see the shooter.\nMax: I can't keep this up.\nIsabel: I almost have it.\n(Another shot bounces off.)\nIsabel: I've got it.\nMax: You see him?\nValenti: Yeah. . . Ready? Go!\n(Max withdraws the shield. Valenti fires several shots and hits the shooter. The shooter is only wounded and runs away. A flashlight appears behind Valenti, Max, and Isabel.)\nDan: Freeze!\nValenti: Dan, It's me!\nDan: What the hell's going on here? Who are you shootin' at?\nValenti: Kidnapper.\nDan: What kidnapper?\nValenti: We found our missing girl.\n(Max and Isabel look at each other nervously while Dan walks over and sees the girl. Dan removes his coat to cover her. The girl is crying.)\n(Later. More police have arrived and an ambulance. The kidnapped girl, Laurie, is on a stretcher.)\nLaurie: (very emotional) I never saw his face. I was coming down to visit my grandparents in Roswell when he . . . came up behind me on the street. . .\nValenti: Laurie, I'm going to have someone watch over you round the clock until your parents arrive. You're safe now. I promise.\nLaurie: How did you know to find me out here?\nValenti: Someone heard you cry out for help.\n(Paramedics take Laurie away. Isabel follows her and Dan approaches the Sheriff.)\nDan: How'd you find her?\nValenti: Good police work.\nDan: Aw, come on. You can do better than that. What were those kids doin' out here?\nValenti: Nothing. They were just along for the ride.\nDan: Along for the ride? You tellin' me that you took two minors with you on a ride along? That alone is enough to get you suspended.\nValenti: I'll take the suspension. You leave the kids out of this.\n(Hansen approaches with a small plastic bag.)\nHansen: Sheriff, look at this.\nValenti: Our shooter's bullets.\nHansen: Yes, but there's no laceration or impact. They're in perfect shape.\nDan: That's impossible, physically impossible. Thanks. Deputy, I'll take care of these.\nValenti: I'm as baffled as you are.\nDan: Nah, nah, you're not. You're a good cop, Jimbo, but you don't lie very well, and whatever you're coverin' up I'm going to find it out. You can count on it.\n(We move over to Laurie and Isabel.)\nLaurie: Who are you?\nIsabel: Isabel.\nLaurie: You saved my life. Thank you.\n(Isabel takes her hand then has a flash of blue cell like things. Laurie is loaded into the ambulance.)\nMax: Ready to go home? Isabel?\nIsabel: There's something about her, Max.\nMax: What do you mean?\nIsabel: It's like I know her.\n(Episode ends with them looking after the ambulance as it pulls away.)\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Any color's fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.\nLeonard: Blue and yellow make green.\nSheldon: Well, then it's settled.\nPenny: Hi. Ready to go?\nSheldon: Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.\nAmy: Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.\nSheldon: Oh, no, we'll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours.\nPenny: Sweetie, you really thought I'd want to do this?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: Well, did you tell him that?\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: Did you say it out loud with words?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: I don't want to spend the whole day playing a board game.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories.\nAmy: I will literally race you to the car.\nLeonard: No, no, no, come on, don't leave. Just try it.\nPenny: No. We're always doing what you guys want. Just once, it'd be nice if you did something we wanted.\nSheldon: You want to be green?\nLeonard: You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we're into.\nPenny: Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director's commentary.\nAmy: Oh, my favorite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and I'm banished to the kitchen.\nPenny: Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we're all gonna do.\nLeonard: You got it, you girls are in charge.\nPenny: Thank you.\nAmy: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Fine. Now that we're not playing, you can be green.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: And since you're green this time, I can be it next time.\nPenny: All right, let's see. What's something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding.\nAmy: I actually can't. My hips don't open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off.\nPenny: All right, well, what do you want to do?\nAmy: There's a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.\nPenny: Well, that's Wilshire's problem. Come on, you know, there, there's got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate.\nLeonard: Hang on, why do we have to hate it?\nPenny: Three words, Doctor Who convention.\nLeonard: I did not force you to go to that.\nPenny: You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn't get beat up.\nLeonard: I wasn't gonna get beat up.\nPenny: You were, but somehow I held myself back.\nSheldon: You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard's asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.\nLeonard: Now you're helping them find ways to make us miserable?\nSheldon: Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, I'm a problem-solver, it's what I do.\nAmy: I actually can't go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.\nPenny: Is there any part of your body that's normal?

I feel like I'm gonna jump out of my skin.\nBernadette: I told you not to wax down there. It's itchy when it grows back.\nRaj: I'm worried about the New Horizons space probe.\nBernadette: What's he talking about?\nHoward: Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and it's finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on.\nRaj: We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it's gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.\nHoward: Now we get to see him flip out because he's worried it was demolished by space ice.\nRaj: Space ice is no joke. I can't even watch Frozen anymore.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ The apartment ]\nAmy: Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.\nSheldon: Before you say yes, it's not the movie about the big dog.\nPenny: How come we can't think of something we both want to do?\nAmy: Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.\nLeonard: Ah, interesting, we're being accused of making you do things you don't like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.\nSheldon: You should point out the hypocrisy of that.\nLeonard: That's what I was doing.\nSheldon: Oh, that wasn't clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?\nPenny: All right, keep thinking.\nSheldon: You're making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I'd hate that. Leonard?\nLeonard: Well, yeah.\nSheldon: Well, then, it's settled?\nAmy: What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.\nPenny: It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.\nSheldon: Well, once again, it's what I do.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Howard and Bernadette's apartment ]\nRaj: Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me.\nHoward: I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour...\nRaj: Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?\nHoward: A story can do two things.\nRaj: Ugh, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack.\nHoward: You work in pharmaceuticals, don't you have anything you can give him?\nBernadette: All I have is our new urine flow drug. Won't help with his anxiety, but it's so strong, when he pees he'll fly around the room like he's got a jet pack.\nRaj: I can't stop thinking about it.\nBernadette: You know, worrying won't have any effect on what happens.\nRaj: I know.\nHoward: Maybe you need to do something more productive.\nRaj: Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.\nHoward: So, in addition to being crazy, you're resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.\nRaj: Yes.\nHoward: The man who crashed his stationary bike.\nRaj: I didn't crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.\nHoward: You happy? Now you can relax.\nRaj: What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Clothes shop ]\nLeonard: This isn't so bad.\nSheldon: That's easy for you to say. Your chair's not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that's a lot of panties.\nAmy: You guys comfy? This might take a while.\nSheldon: I don't understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.\nPenny: No, you're right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.\nSheldon: They have a man there who understands my personal style.\nPenny: Bye.\nLeonard: Uh, I've got some bad news. There's no cell service in here.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, that's all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented.\nLeonard: That's true.\nSheldon: I'll look them up. Son of a biscuit.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it's fine.\nSheldon: No, it's not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn't at least have Wi-Fi? I'm going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Clothes shop - later ]\nSheldon: Let's see, my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three.\nLeonard: Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win.\nSheldon: Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it. I wonder how long we're gonna be stuck here.\nLeonard: I don't know, but the girls do a lot for us. It's the least we can do.\nSheldon: Oh, that's true. I suppose it's only fair we make compromises.\nLeonard: Look at you, being all mature.\nSheldon: I don't know why you're so surprised. If there's one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it's how to compromise.\nLeonard: I, I'm sorry? You make compromises for me?\nSheldon: All the time.\nLeonard: On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we're living?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should've, because everyone was laughing at you.\nLeonard: That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.\nSheldon: Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.\nLeonard: What? Then. then why don't you do it?\nSheldon: Uh, well, it's scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can't take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I'm practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Raj's car ]\nRaj: Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company.\nHoward: I'm happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?\nRaj: If it's okay with you, I'd like to go to temple.\nHoward: Buddy, trust me, you don't want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it's not all briskets and dreidels.\nRaj: I meant a Hindu temple.\nHoward: Oh. Okay. It's not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn't gonna rip my heart out.\nRaj: Dude, that movie's an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.\nHoward: You love that movie.\nRaj: Yeah, it's pretty great.\nHoward: I'm surprised to see you suddenly get religious.\nRaj: Why?\nHoward: Well, because I've known you for ten years and you've never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house.\nRaj: Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don't talk about it.\nHoward: Yeah, but you're a scientist.\nRaj: So?\nHoward: So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you're counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?\nRaj: That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?\nHoward: No. There's also Apu from The Simpsons.\nRaj: Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.\nHoward: Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe.\nRaj: Actually there's no proof of that.\nHoward: You believe in your religion, I'll believe in mine.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Store changing rooms ]\nAmy: How's it going in there?\nPenny: Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?\nAmy: Sure.\nPenny: Do I really force you to do things you don't want to?\nAmy: Yeah, but it's okay.\nPenny: How is it okay?\nAmy: I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I'd do whatever they said. Really, I'm lucky you found me before a cult did.\nPenny: Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You're a different woman now. You're smart, you've got great friends, you've got a boyfriend, you're pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we're gonna do whatever you want.\nAmy: Really?\nPenny: Absolutely. You name it, we're doing it.\nAmy: Basket weaving at the craft museum.\nPenny: Well, you named it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ The store ]\nSheldon: Oh, here's another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A, but I don't put it there because I don't want you breaking one of your little legs when you're supposed to be making my breakfast.\nLeonard: Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?\nSheldon: I wasn't done, but go ahead. He said, compromising.\nLeonard: Because of you, I'm not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I'm not allowed to whistle. I don't wear shoes that might squeak.\nSheldon: Well, you're a physicist, not a circus clown.\nLeonard: Sheldon, do you realize I don't live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.\nSheldon: Is that true?\nLeonard: Yes, it's true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.\nSheldon: Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.\nLeonard: You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It's exhausting.\nSheldon: You know what? You think you're so tolerant, but the truth is you're mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don't notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. I've been holding a lot of this in for a while.\nSheldon: Well, I'm sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should.\nLeonard: Do you mean that?\nSheldon: Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.\nLeonard: Come on, don't get upset.\nSheldon: I'm not upset. I'm just imagining a world without my best friend in it.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: It's okay.\nLeonard: I'm not leaving your world. I'm just talking about living across the hall.\nSheldon: I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I'm aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.\nLeonard: Buddy.\nPenny: How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?\nLeonard: Everything's fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.\nAmy: Are you crazy? You know he's a flight risk.\nSheldon: That's exactly what I told him.\nPenny: Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard's not gonna move out until you're ready.\nSheldon: Well, what if you did it gradually?\nLeonard: All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?\nSheldon: How about one night and I let you whistle?\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: When I'm not home.\nLeonard: You got it.\nSheldon: There we go, compromising again. We really are the best.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Temple car park ]\nHoward: Here we go, my first Hindu temple.\nRaj: You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? It's called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine.\nHoward: Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.\nRaj: All right. Shall we?\nHoward: Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?\nRaj: Like what?\nHoward: Like am I dressed okay?\nRaj: Really? So every other place you've been, you thought this was fine?\nHoward: I know you're under a lot of pressure, so I'm gonna let that pass.\nRaj: Sorry. You're right. I'm so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it's okay. We're all part of an immense pattern, and though we can't understand it, we can be happy to know that it's, it's working its will through us.\nHoward: That's nice.\nRaj: Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, we're all interconnected, and that's just a beautiful... Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn't hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog's hair just gave her bangs.\nHoward: Raj.\nRaj: You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.\nHoward: Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. It's fine.\nRaj: Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Craft museum ]\nLeonard: I thought this was gonna be boring, but it's actually kind of fun.\nPenny: Don't tell Amy that. We'll be here every Sunday.\nAmy: Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.\nSheldon: It's not a basket. It's a soldier's helmet from 16th century China.\nAmy: Very nice.\nLeonard: Yeah, it looks great.\nSheldon: I saw that.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Penny's bedroom ]\nLeonard: Well, roomie, it's only one night a week, but it's a start.\nPenny: I know. I'm really proud of Sheldon.\nLeonard: Yeah, I'm proud of him, too.\nSheldon (in Penny's living room): Can you keep it down?

        "prompt_0": "[PREVIOUSLY_ON]\nLou: I think starbright is a really good fit for her. (Quietly) Because it'll give her a chance to catch up. Catch up? Ms. Wadsworth doesn't think that Katie is ready. She's beautiful.\nBob: She's nearing the end of her pregnancy. I like you, Ty, you impress me. Ah, well, you know I already have a job. Well, with this grant I can match what Scott pays. You really gonna do this? You left me no choice. I saw the video, Amy. I saw you kissing Ahmed. I'm not working for Ahmed anymore. So come on, let's take it for a spin before I have to ship it back.\n(Truck roars)\nTy: Whooo!\nAmy: I'll see you tonight?\nTy: Absolutely. (Small laugh) You know, maybe you could just tell Bob Granger that you thought you start work tomorrow not today.\nAmy: Right?\nTy: No... I gotta go.\nAmy: Okay. We'll see you tonight.\nTy: Okay. See ya.\nAmy: Bye.\n(Truck door shuts)\n(Engine starts and hums)\n(Ty honks)\n(Hooves thunder)\nSandra: Okay. Go easy! That's it, Georgie! Okay. Not bad. Do you wanna work on your \"backward thunder\"?\nGeorgie: Yeah sure. (Georgie clicks her tongue) (Grunts with effort) I messed up at the end. Can I go again?\nSandra: Sorry, Georgie, you've run out of time. There's another girl signed up.\nBut I only had a half hour. Can I just have ten more minutes? Please? I'm never gonna get the practice time I need to audition for the extreme team.\nSandra: I can't keep my students waiting. And you've still got plenty of time to get ready for that audition. Don't stress.\n(Gate clanks and squeaks open)\nOlivia: Are you finally finished?\nGeorgie: What are you doing here?\nOlivia: What do you think? I'm taking lessons just like you. Only, Sandra gives me private ones. She says I'm a natural.\n(Truck rumbles up)\nTim: Hi.\nCasey: Hey Tim!\nTim: I heard you were pulling out of town.\nCasey: Yeah. I got a string of rodeos from longview right through to Southern Montana. So... I'll be gone for a few weeks.\nTim: Well, we never got that lunch we talked about.\nCasey: Well, you never asked so...\n(Surprised laugh)\nTim: This is me asking.\n(Laughs)\nWell, that sounds good.\nTim: Okay.\nCasey: Name the date.\nTim: Okay.\nCasey: No pressure. (Laughs) Bye!\nLou: Surely the doctor can see her before then? I mean, four months? That's crazy... No. I-I appreciate that you have a waiting list but... but what if there is a cancellation? Yes. No, please, please do let me know. Thank you. Four month wait. Can you believe that?\nPeter: You know, just because some know it all principal at an overpriced preschool thinks she's not ready does not mean there is anything wrong with our daughter, sweetheart.\nLou: Dr. Lauder is the best special education psychologist in the field, honey. I mean, there's no harm in checking, right?\nPeter: Okay. Yeah, absolutely. I won't mention it again.\nLou: How was your class?\nJack: Wrong question.\nGeorgie: It sucked!\nLou: Hey language...\nGeorgie: Okay. Well, it did. And I barely had any time on Chaplin. And too many people signed up so there weren't enough horses. Oh, and guess who's taking private lessons with Sandra?\nGeorgie: Guess!\nLou: I-I don't know.\nGeorgie: Olivia!\nLou: Olivia. Great.\nGeorgie: Yep. She couldn't stand that I was doing something she wasn't. So she just had to signed up. And that was the only reason she signed up. Agh. I'm so mad! Hi Katie.\nKatie: Hi.\n(Phone rings)\nLou: Grandpa, it might be the clinic...\nJack: Hello. Hang on, is Amy...?\nLou: No. She rode over to Ty's. She'll be back soon.\nJack: No, I'm sorry she's riding her horse back from Ty's place. But I'm sure she won't be that long.\nRight. Have a good one. Who was it? You will never guess.\n(Hooves thud)\n(Horse snorts)\n(Hooves thunder)\nAhmed: Hello. I was hoping I would run into you. You look beautiful.\nS08E04\n♪ And at the break of day you sank into your dream ♪ ♪ You dreamer ♪ oh-oh-oh... ♪ You dreamer ♪ you dreamer\nAmy: What are you doing here? Why aren't you in Europe with the rest of your team?\nAhmed: It's a pleasure to see you too.\nAmy: (Scoff) I'm sorry it's just...\nAhmed: I was compelled to come back. What else could I do? You were ignoring all my emails and texts. Well...\nAhmed: And then the truck. I don't understand why you would return the truck. It was a bonus for all your hard work. It was too big of a gesture. I wasn't comfortable with it.\nAhmed: It would have been valuable when we are back working at Hillhurst. You wouldn't always be depending on other peoples' vehicles. I'm not coming back to work at Hillhurst. I told you that. No. You said you weren't coming back to the tour. That's not what I said. Now you're saying you don't want to be my head trainer here at Hillhurst? Not possible. Of course you are staying on. No. I'm not. I thought you understood. Why would you walk away from something you excelled at, that you enjoyed. Ahmed, you know why... All right. I admit the circumstances were slightly awkward... before you left France... You're just tired from the tour. When you have time to relax, rethink, you will see things more clearly.\nAmy: Ahmed...\nAhmed: Can I at least accompany you home? (Frustrated sigh) Sure.\n(Door creaks open)\n(Birds chirping, howling)\nBob: I am freaking out here, man. Four new animals have been dropped off since yesterday! Four!\nA bear cub that turned up in someone's garbage. Two coyote cubs, and a porcupine that we gotta check for rabies.\nTy: Absolutely. Yeah.\nBob: Oh, and hey, see that feed shipment that just arrived? Take care of that. Also the llama fence over there looks like the side is sagging. If it is, fix it.\nTy: Yeah, I can handle that.\nBob: Oh and on top of everything else, the pregnant wolf is about to pop. So take a look at her for me? Will do.\nBob: Thanks, bud.\nLou: Yes, but are you sure that's necessary? Because I'd really like to see Dr. Lauder not... I understand. Yes, thank you.\nTim: Hi.\nLou: Oh hi. Dad. Okay, so apparently she should see a special education evaluator if we can't get an appointment with Dr. Lauder. What do you think?\nTim: What?\nLou: A special education evaluator. It's for Katie.\nTim: Oh. Listen, you two, don't stress this. There is nothing wrong with my grand daughter. Thank you, Tim. I couldn't agree more.\nTim: That's gotta be a first, general.\nTim: Lou.\nTim: Ahmed is back.\nLou: What?! Now that is a relationship worth nurturing.\nLou: Yes, so you've said. Dad. Dad, come back here! Dad... Just wait a second.\nTim: Ahmed! Good to see you! Congratulations on a successful tour.\nAhmed: Our success was greatly due to your daughter's expertise. Well, I think it calls for a celebration. Why don't join us for dinner tonight? What's do you say? Is it okay, Lou?\nAhmed: I would love to, but I will have to take... what do you call it? A rain check. Another evening would be wonderful. Huh.\nAhmed: I will talk to you soon, Amy. Ha.\nAmy: Georgie is that a trick ridding saddle on Phoenix? There's no way. Phoenix is a great horse but he's not a trick riding horse. Phoenix can do anything. Including trick riding. So, Ahmed is back. That's just great, isn't it?\nAmy: Georgie! You are not trick riding on Phoenix!\nGeorgie: Relax. I'm just getting him used to the saddle!\nTim: Lou. Lou. I don't understand why you're ticked off with me for inviting Ahmed to dinner?\nLou: Because, it's just...\nTim: It's-it's what? It's not very hospitable.\nLou: What? I'm not prepared to invite a prince to dinner at the last minute, okay?\nTim: I don't-I don't think he'd care, okay? The guy- he's down to earth.\nJack: Yeah. For a guy who owns a private jet.\nTim: Let's not forget how kind he wad to Amy when she was injured. He was very, very generous. We should all remember that. So I don't see what the problem is.\nGeorgie: Good boy, Phoenix. You like this saddle, don't you? (Phoenix snorts) Whoa! Oof!\nAmy: Georgie! Come on now, you said you weren't gonna do a trick! You could have really hurt yourself or Phoenix!\nGeorgie: Okay! Okay!\nAmy: No. It's not okay! You need to learn to think before you make these crazy decisions!\nGeorgie: You should talk.\n(Georgie clicks her tongue, Phoenix snorts)\nAmy: You know I'm right.\nGeorgie: You have to talk to Sandra!\nMaybe she can give me some extra time on Chaplin after school or something.\nPeter: You got a lot going on after school already.\nGeorgie: Well, I need to practice time or else I'm not gonna make the extreme team. Please can I have private lessons, like Olivia?\nPeter: No. You can't because we can't afford it, Georgie, okay? And you have to understand that things aren't always gonna go the way you want them to, all right?\nGeorgie: Obviously. (Bowl clanks on the floor) Peter: Oops!\nKatie: Can you pick up my plate, please!\nTy: Sorry, I'm late, everyone.\nLou: Honey, it's a bowl. Can you say, pick up my bowl? I just come straight from work, I didn't have time to change there.\nAmy: How did it go?\nTy: It was great! The place is amazing! It's a little disorganized. Nothing we can't whip into shape. I got to baby-sit a bear cub today. Oh, that's what I'm smelling. (Laughs)\nGeorgie: How is the wolf?\nTy: She's about ready to have her babies. Yeah-oh, I forgot to look at the llama fence today!\nGeorgie: What?\nTy: Shoot! I have to do that tomorrow.\nGeorgie: They have lamas?\nTy: Yeah. They do.\nGeorgie: I love lamas. They spit!\n(Laughing)\nTim: So Amy, honey, what's your plan?\nAmy: What do you mean my plan?\nTim: Well, Ahmed is back. So what-what's your plan?\nAre you gonna head up to Hillhurst?\nTy: Ahmed is back in town? I thought he was in Europe with his team.\nLou: Does anyone want seconds on the salad?\nAmy: I'm okay.\nTim: I tell you, the guy - he is so friendly, huh? Wasn't he this afternoon?\nTy: Oh, you saw him today?\nAmy: Uh, yeah, I ran into him on the way back from your place. You know what? I made pie. Who's up for coffee and pie?\n(Screen door creaks shut)\nTy: So Ahmed... What was that about?\nAmy: (Heavy exhale) Take a guess.\nTy: He came all the way back here to try and talk you out of your decision?\nAmy: Yeah. But I set him straight.\nTy: That's my girl. Stick to your guns.\nTy: I'll call you tomorrow. I gotta work late so I might miss dinner.\nAmy: Okay.\n(SUV rumbles)\n(Knock on door) Jack: Come in.\nJack: Ahmed. Welcome back!\nAhmed: Hello. Thank you.\nJack: Look who's here.\nHello. I'm on my way to an auction in Black Diamond. I would love you to come with me. Look over the horses I'm interested in. Give me advice.\nJack: Amy's got a great eye that's for sure.\nAmy: Ah, it's just you know, I can't. I have chores pilling up.\nJack: Oh, I'll do your work for you. You should go. Catch up on the tour news. It's just-it's a little short-notice... You know, I'm not ready. Take your time. Okay. Uh, yeah. I'll just need a few minutes. Ahmed, would you mind if Ty came?\nAhmed: Not at all.\nAmy: He's just really good at auctions.\nJack: Yeah.\nAhmed: I'll wait for you outside.\nAmy: Okay. Nice to see you, Mr. Bartlett.\nJack: You too. Have fun.\nAhmed: Thank you.\n(Door shuts, dialing beeps)\nAhmed: There's one animal in particular that is interesting to me. A belgian warmblood. Incredible lineage. I look forward to your opinion.\nAmy: Yeah, of course.\nAmy: So... did I tell you about the new business that Ty has started? He and a partner are buying rodeo prospect horses. and training them. They're actually really good at it. I've been helping train some of the horses.\n(Phone chimes)\nExcuse me. (Phone beeps on) Hello, Ty.\nTy: I can't meet you. Bob just called. He's got called out on an emergency pick up. So I need to go into work right now. I'm sorry. But you can deal with him though, right?\nAmy: Yeah. Of course. Absolutely. I love you.\nTy: Okay. Love you.\nAhmed: Everything all right?\nAmy: Yeah, um, Ty just can't come. He got called into work.\n(Door slams shut)\nAll I remember is it was crazy back than.\nCasey: Well, you were crazy. You had partied and rodeoed and then partied some more. Thanks for this, by the way. This is so much better than a restaurant.\nTim: From a restaurant.\n(Casey giggles)\nCasey: So that year... You just won your 3rd consecutive all round cowboy trophy, right?\n(Chuckles) Oh. Your 4th? Who's counting? Do you remember that big dance after stampede? And nobody went home until noon the next day.\nTim: Yeah, yeah. I don't remember that.\n(Casey chuckles)\nYou know what I remember? And what I miss? It's the atmosphere. You know, once that gets in your blood...\nCasey: Well, if you really do miss it, maybe you should come with me on my rodeo tour.\n(Chuckles)\nThat atmosphere still exists. There's nothing like it. I don't know.\nLou: There was a cancellation? Fantastic. No. Absolutely, we can make it. Thank you for letting me know.\nPeter: Here we go. Dr. Lauder's office, there is a cancellation.\nPeter: I gathered that.\nLou: They can see Katie in an hour. Honey, he is so hard to get into. You know he has a huge-\nPeter: Waiting list. Yeah, I know you told me. Um, I guess that's why he's the best.\nLou: I'm just saying, he can give us a reliable opinion on Katie. I don't see why you're fighting me on this? He's a really good doctor.\nKatie: No doctor!\nLou: Katie? Katie! Honey... (Katie slams the door)\nTy: Oh great. They're out! C'mon, guys! Go this way! No. No. No. No! Here we go! Here we go! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! It's okay. (Llama spits) Oh! What was that?! Aghhh!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAmy: Oh! Oh! You missed your turn. The auction is that way.\nAhmed: We're going to make a small detour. I have something else I need your advice on.\nLou: Come on, Katie, we really have to go now.\nKatie: No, mamma.\nLou: (Sighs) Okay. Honey, it's gonna be really, really fun. You can colour pictures and play with toys.\nKatie: No needles.\nLou: No needles. I promise.\nLou: Look. You can bring Mookie if you want. Do you wanna bring Mookie? Katie please.\n(Sighs)\n(Hooves thunder)\nSandra: Nice work! All right, Georgie, you're up.\nGeorgie: All right. (Clicks tongue)\n(Hooves thunder)\nSandra: That was great! You're doing really well. Now with just a little bit more practice...\nThat's the problem. I can't practice. It's not that I don't have the time. It's that I don't have a horse. Chaplin isn't available very often. I know. But what can I say? He's a popular horse, Georgie. All the girls want their lessons on him.\nOlivia: Nice, huh? My dad just got him for me yesterday. His name is winner and that's just what I intend on doing.\n(SUV rumbles)\n(Buttons click)\n(Tires crunch)\n(Birds chirp)\nAmy: Wow. Is this a hotel?\nAhmed: No. No. A private residence. What do you think?\nAmy: It's amazing... It's huge...\nAhmed: Not really. Just over 13,000 square feet. I'm thinking of buying it. I'd be glad to get your honest opinion about it. You know I value it on everything... not just auction horses. Hmm?\nCome. I want to show you around. It's quite impressive.\nAmy: Yeah.\nAhmed: 147 acres. Totally private. Took them years to landscape it. Everything had to be brought in. Apparently in the summer this is a massive rose garden. The best in Alberta I'm told. And the views are spectacular. Don't you think?\nAmy: It's beautiful. I've really never seen anything like it. Your house in France is incredible. It is. But I feel the need to put down some roots here as well. And I'll show you the inside too. And the stables. I think you will love the stables. I'm happy to see you're wearing my necklace. Well, this is from the team. No, it was from me. I bought it alone for you. You see, Amy. I want to give you things. I've never wanted to give anything to any other person in my life. Ahmed, please...\nAhmed: No. Hear me out. I'm a man who has been accused of being... unfeeling. I'm not proud of it. It was simply the way I was raised. Emotion doesn't come easily to me. But I know it now. How it feels. And I must tell you because I'm not sure I will ever feel this way again.\nAmy: Ahmed...\nAhmed: No. It has to be said. You have to know. I'm in love with you. You see, Amy... I've been feeling this way for a very, very long time. Amy, please, listen to me. You are the only woman ever in my life that I can be completely myself with. The only woman that will tell me the truth about myself. The only woman I have ever had feelings for in such a strong undeniable way.\nAmy: Ahmed, I'm flattered. I really am, but this can't happen, okay? We can be friends, but-but that's it. I'm engaged. I'm in love with Ty.\nAhmed: Are you?\nAmy: Yes!\nAhmed: Then why did you kiss me?\nAmy: I-I didn't kiss you. You kissed me. You gave me every reason to. I don't make a habit of kissing random girls.\nAmy: If I gave you that impression, I am sorry. But I thought I made it perfectly clear that night how I felt. That we are friends and team mates, and nothing more. You know, Ahmed, I really enjoyed and valued our relationship, but given the circumstances, we need to end this. Look, I think it's fair to either of us to continue. I need some distance. Some distance. All right. Of course. I understand.\nAmy: Do you?\nAhmed: Yes. I will drive you home.\n(Wolf groans in discomfort)\nTy: Whoa, whoa, easy girl. Easy. I'm not gonna hurt you.\nShe's fighting me a bit. That's a good sign. She's got her strength back. She's hydrated. And she's looking a lot better than when I first saw her.\nBob: I know. Well, that's why I hired you. Hey... good girl.\n(Panting)\nLou: So you were pretty quiet the whole way home. What did you think?\nPeter: Uh, that it was a complete waste of time and energy to be honest with you. We did it, right? So... Good. Find out soon.\nLou: Okay? Hey honey...\n(SUV rumbles)\nAhmed: I want you to know I meant every word I said. Perhaps you should take some time to think.\nAmy: I am sorry, but there's nothing for me to think about.\nAhmed: Amy, I think you have to open your mind to life's possibilities.\nI know what I want in life. And I already have it. Goodbye Ahmed.\nLou: He said that? He actually said that he loved you?\nAmy: Yes. He did!\nLou: Oh Amy...\nAmy: Lou, I know I never gave him any signs that we were more than just co-workers, or friends... I don't think I did anything to lead him on. And I've asked myself that over and over again. Look, we were friends, okay? Just friends. And I told him that the night of the party. And I didn't think he listen to me. I don't think he listened to me today! I don't know what to do, okay? I have no idea. And... do I tell Ty?\nLou: No! Do not tell Ty, okay? You've tried that in the past and it didn't work out. I know, but Lou... Amy, just deal with this Ahmed situation as swiftly and smoothly as you can on your own. Be firm with him and he will go away. And then everything will go back to normal. I want that. I just don't wanna hurt Ty. You know, I love him so much. And I don't want... (Georgie sobs)\nLou: You know Ahmed is just used to getting exactly what he wants. Don't worry, okay?\nGeorgie: It's all my fault.\nLou: No! Georgie!\n(Georgie slams door) Peter: What's that all about?\nLou: Pour me a glass of wine and I'll tell you all about it.\n(Sobbing)\nAmy: Georgie. Hey... There's no reason to cry. It's not your fault.\nGeorgie: Yes it is.\nAmy: How?\nGeorgie: Because I was the one who found the video.\nAmy: You did?\nGeorgie: Yes, I followed your tour online. And it was on some stupid blog.\nAmy: But I thought Lou...\nGeorgie: I'm the one who showed her... And I should have kept it to myself! I am so sorry.\nAmy: No. You have no reason to apologize.\nGeorgie: But I blamed you for what happened at that party. It was all that stupid Ahmed's fault. I am so sorry. Will you ever forgive me?\nOf course. It's okay.\n(Birds chirp)\nJack: So how did the appointment go?\nLou: The doctor said he would let us know. He seemed pretty noncommittal.\nJack: Hmm. See, it's my opinion that you know, people they look at this stuff and get all wrought up about it before they even know if there is anything really wrong.\nOkay, grandpa... I have a sore knee today, Lou. And I bet if I looked up \"sore knee\" on the Internet I'd find a bunch of articles and opinions that end up making me think I have to have my whole damn leg cut off at the hip. I'm just arming myself, okay? In case... You're scaring yourself, Lou. If there's a problem, which I very much doubt, you and Peter, you'll work it out. We all will. A word to the wise... take that Internet stuff with the grain of salt. It betrays as much as it enlightens.\nLou: Were there any messages on the home line?\nGeorgie: Just one. From guess who? Olivia.\nLou: What did she want?\nGeorgie: I don't know, I didn't call her back. But did I tell you that her parents bought her her very own trick riding horse?\nLou: Really? Well, that will free up some time on Chaplin.\nGeorgie: Not really. I mean, there's a line up of kids waiting to ride Chaplin. So, she's got her own trick riding horse when I don't even have a trick horse to practice on.\nLou: Honey...\nTy: Hey there!\nAmy: Hey...\nTy: Our mamma wolf is about to give birth tonight. So I might have to take off early.\nAmy: Oh, okay.\nTy: This looks good.\nAmy: Uh... Hey, you don't happen to know a trick riding horse that's orphaned, do you?\nTy: Hmm. I don't know. Maybe. I'll give Caleb a call. See what's he's got on the go.\nGeorgie: Really? That'd be awesome!\nTim: Hey, look who's coming to dinner! Well, now that you have all that experience from the tour, Amy I think you can name your price when it comes to training, but you owe a lot of thanks to Ahmed here. He's the one who took the leap of faith. It wasn't a leap of faith. I was quite confident that Amy had the knowledge and the personality to excel at being a head trainer. And I was proven right. I do hope that it increases the quality of your clientele, I also hope it will not interfere with the time you allow me at Hillhurst.\nAmy: Ahmed, I told you, that's not really part of my plan.\nTy: I think Amy made it very clear, she isn't working for you anymore. She works with horses that really need her. Not the high end animals you deal with. She's getting back to her roots.\nAhmed: Back to her roots... that's not the best plan for a profitable career.\nTy: Well, I think that's Amy's business.\nAmy: Okay Ty.\nAhmed: Well, I think that you should be encouraging her to move forward, not backward.\nTy: I don't think it's your business to have an opinion at all.\nTim: I don't-I don't think that Amy has made up her mind yet, have you, honey?\nAmy: Yes dad. I've made my decision.\nTim: Well, Ahmed has been very generous.\nGeorgie: Actually he's not generous! He's fake and a liar. You don't understand.\nPeter: Hey! Hey!\nLou: That's enough...\nPeter: Georgie, stay out of it! He's pretending to be friends with all of us just so he can steal Amy away from Ty.\nPeter: Honey...\nGeorgie: He told Amy he loved her, Ty.\nAmy: Oh...\nGeorgie: He did! I hate you!\nPeter: Hey, Georgie. Excuse me. I got it.\nTy: Okay, what is she talking about?\nAhmed: I have no idea.\nLou: Yes, you do. You know what? I've seen it from the first with you. Trying to buy Amy's love with fancy necklaces and trucks and horses. I'm sorry, but who do you think you are?\nAmy: Lou! No.\nAhmed: Excuse me?\nLou: No. No. You may think you're in love with my sister but you're not.\nLou: If you did, you would respect Amy and Ty's relationship and not try to ruin it.\nTy: Okay, what the heck is going on?\nAhmed: Amy, tell him.\nAmy: Tell him what? I told you I quit, but you don't listen. Look, I ended our relationship.\nTy: Relationship?! What relationship?!\nAmy: Whoa, whoa! Our working relationship... Ty-I have... Look, I quit a million times! But you only hear what you wanna hear!\nJack: Think it would be a good idea if you left.\nAhmed: Gladly. I certainly don't need to listen to this.\nAmy: No, Ty, just leave it. Hey, when did all this happen? Tell me!\nAhmed: I don't need to answer to you.\nTy: Oh, yes, you do. Was it right from the start? Was it when you gave her that damn saddle? Huh?\nTy: Was it?!\nAhmed: Don't touch me!\nTy: Where do you get off telling her that you love her?\nAhmed: Of course I love her. I would do anything for her. And you! All you do is hold her back. You will be the man that prevents her from a future you have no idea how to even imagine! She could have anything! You will stand in her way!\n(Forceful grunt)\nAmy: Ty!\nAhmed: You can't do that to me!\nAhmed: Oof! (Landing a punch)\nTy: Yes, I can...\nJack: C'mon now! Ease off...\nAhmed: Get off me!\nJack: Enough! Enough!\n(Gathering breaths)\nAhmed: After all I did for you, this is how you want to leave things?!\n(Retreating footsteps)\n(Calming breaths)\n(Door slams, truck starts and rumbles away)\nAmy: Ty...\nTy: What was that about?\nWere you ever gonna tell me?\nAmy: There was nothing to tell! It was all in his head! I don't even know what to say to you right now! You always do this to me.\nAmy: Do what?\nTy: Secrets, Amy. You keep these damn secrets!\nAmy: Look, he thought that we were more than friends, I told him we weren't! It's not my fault! I can't help that he thought we were more than friends!\nTy: I don't care what happened. I don't care, Amy!\nAmy: Nothing happened!\nTy: Whatever did happen, you weren't about to tell me! And I had to face off with this damn idiot! When are you gonna be straight with me, Amy? Huh? I've just about had it!\nAmy: What do you mean by that?\n(Phone rings)\n(Beeps phone on)\nTy: Bob. Okay. Yeah. I'm on my way. (Beeps phone off)\nThe wolf is about to give birth.\n(Footsteps crunch)\n(Truck door slams) Amy: Ty! Wait!\n(Truck rumbles away)\n(Sighs)\n(Door slams shut)\nLou: Honey, you okay?\nGeorgie: I'm sorry, Amy.\nLou: It's okay. Let's just give her some space, okay?\n(Door slams)\nTim: I didn't know. Nobody told me a thing.\nYou think I would have invited the guy for dinner? (Sighs) I didn't know, Jack.\n(Birds chirp)\nTy: Easy. Her heart rate's dropping.\n(Wolf whimpers)\nTy: Yeah. Her gums are pale too.\nBob: She maybe be bleeding internally.\nTy: Shift over.\nBob: It's okay. It's okay. Easy now.\n(Wolf whimpers)\nHer pups are coming...\nTim: Hey.\nCasey: Hey.\nCasey: For you.\nTim: (Sighs) Thank you.\nCasey: You're welcome.\n(Tim sighs heavily)\nCasey: You okay?\nTim: I messed up. Nobody... If I just known... You know, if people just... filled me in.\nCasey: Well, sometimes these things can't be helped.\nTim: So were you serious when you asked if I... would go on a rodeo tour with you?\nCasey: Yeah. Yes, I was.\nTim: All right. I'm going.\nBob: At least we saved one of them.\n(Pup whimpers)\n(Phone rings)\nHello. Oh yes. Really? That is good news. That is very good news. Uh, how did she score on her phonological processing? (Relived) Really? That good? Yes, thank you for calling. Bye. (Beeps phone off) Uh, that was Dr. Lauder's office, and um, Katie is fine, honey. She's just fine.\nGeorgie: Wow! I can't believe it!\nJack: Yep. Courtesy of Caleb. She how flashy she looks. Now this is a trick riding horse if ever I saw one.\nGeorgie: Awww.\nTy: I'm glad Caleb came through for you?\nGeorgie: Thanks, Ty, so she's beautiful.\nTy: I'm glad you like her. Can I just say something... It was me who saw the video. And I never should have told anyone about it.\nTy: What video?\nGeorgie: I-I thought Amy told you.\nJack: In the barn.\nAmy: Ty! I tried to call you... I'm so, so sorry about last night. How's the wolf?\nTy: We lost her.\nAmy: I'm sorry.\nTy: Yeah. I don't get it. She seemed to be in pretty good shape. (Exhales) I did everything, but... I lost her. One of the pups survived. He seems to be doing fine. So far.\nAmy: There's something I think you should see, something that started this whole mess.\nTy: Some video? Georgie just told me.\nAmy: I should have never kept it from you.\nTy: I don't wanna see it. I don't want to see anything, Amy.\nAmy: No. I want you to see it. And right after that I pushed him away. And I told him that we were just friends. And I-I thought he got it. But like I said, Ahmed only hears what he wants to hear.\nTy: Well, I guess I do too.\nAmy: What does that mean? Well, I guess I've been convincing myself that we're good. But I'm not so sure right now.\nAmy: Ty, we... we are good.\nTy: Amy, listen to me. I have to say this, okay? You've changed. How have I changed? You just have. You're not the same girl. Yes, I am. I am the same. No. You're not. You used to be this girl who... You used to be this girl who would do anything to save a horse when everyone else was writing off as a lost cause. You rescued them. You fought for them. You fixed them! Where has that gone? Now you're just servicing rich people's horses. What is that? They don't need rescuing! They don't need you. And that video... I just watched a wolf and her pup die... I'm sorry... I'm so sorry.\nTy: Now you're showing me this video with people partying, and living it up and... I guess that was your life over there. I just don't feel like I know you anymore... And now this Ahmed thing is...\nAmy: There was no Ahmed thing.\n(Sharp exhale)\nI think we need a break. We need to figure this out... on our own. No. Ty, come on! I love you so much. And I love you too... I do Amy. But we need some time to figure out what it is that we want. What you want. I know what I want. Maybe. But sometimes we lose things and no matter how hard we try to hold on or without even knowing it... we've lost it. No. No... Please... Ty no...\n♪ And I... ♪ will swallow my pride ♪ You're the one that I love ♪ and I'm saying goodbye ♪ Say something I'm giving up on you ♪ ♪ And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you ♪ ♪ Anywhere, I would've followed you ♪ ♪ Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh... ♪ Say something I'm giving up on you ♪\nAnnouncer: Heartbreak on heartland. What? It's not like he came to see me.\nAnnouncer: Now it's up to Georgie to put things right. It's all my fault. We're still good, right? Nothing's changed. Everything's changed.\nAnnouncer: An all-new heartland, next Sunday at 7:00 on CBC\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The text is a conversation between two characters, Amy and Ty, who are in a relationship. The conversation is about their relationship and the changes that have occurred in their lives. Amy has been working as a horse trainer and has been involved in rescuing horses. However, she has recently been working for a wealthy client and has been partying with them. This has caused a rift in their relationship. Ty is upset by this and feels that Amy has changed and is no longer the same person he knew. He also feels that she has lost her passion for rescuing horses and is now just servicing rich people's horses. He is also upset by the video that Amy showed him, which showed a wolf and her pup dying. He feels that this has changed him and that he no longer knows Amy. The conversation ends with Amy and Ty agreeing to take some time to figure out what they want and to decide if their relationship is still worth saving.</s>【我为群众办实事】“我为群众办实事”实践活动—— 开展“送法进企业”活动"

I have already done so four times.\nTEGAN: So?\nDOCTOR: Don't you see? Eight of them, eight of me.\nTEGAN: They want your remaining regenerations?\nDOCTOR: It's the only way to end their mutation.\nNYSSA: Is that possible?\nDOCTOR: With this equipment, yes.\nBRIG '83: Let's get back to the TARDIS before they become hostile.\nTEGAN: Come on, Doctor, we've got to get out of here.\nMAWDRYN: We're scientists, not warriors. We have no weapons. The Doctor can only help us of his own free will.\nTEGAN: What you want is murder eight times over.\nMAWDRYN: No. What we desire is our own death.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): Turlough, my plans are in hazard. This friend of the Doctor's\nTURLOUGH: The Brigadier?\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): He is present on the ship in two aspects.\nTURLOUGH: That isn't possible.\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): It is forbidden, but not impossible. He has travelled through time in the TARDIS.\nTURLOUGH: But if the two aspects converged\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): The instability could destroy everything. You must find the Brigadier who travelled with the Doctor's companions.\nTURLOUGH: Leave here?\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): You will obey me. The two Brigadiers must be kept apart.\nTURLOUGH: What about those creatures?\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): They are harmless. They only threaten the Doctor.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMAWDRYN: We did not know that our experiments would bring endless mutation.\nDOCTOR: You have the regenerator, the facilities of the laboratory. Continue your experiments, find how to reverse the process.\nMAWDRYN: We have known for many years that the process is irreversible.\nMUTANT: We have experimented for centuries.\nMUTANT 2: We have tried to discover a remedy.\nMUTANT: There is no remission.\nMAWDRYN: Only you, as a Time Lord, can help us.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: Hello, Brigadier.\nBRIG '77: Who the devil are you?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: I cannot do what you ask.\nMAWDRYN: You cannot refuse.\nDOCTOR: I must.\nMAWDRYN: So be it, Doctor. Leave now, with your friends. But accept the consequences of your actions.\nNYSSA: What does he mean?\nDOCTOR: I don't know.\nBRIG '83: Back to the TARDIS?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBRIG '77: So you're Turlough? Yes, Tegan told me about you.\nTURLOUGH: I've come to take you to the Doctor.\nBRIG '77: The Doctor? You know where he is?\nTURLOUGH: Of course. Come on.\nBRIG '77: Not so fast. Keep in the shadows. We have some disagreeable fellow passengers.\nTURLOUGH: They're harmless.\nBRIG '77: That remains to be seen.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMUTANT: The Doctor was our only hope.\nMUTANT 2: He must not be allowed to escape.\nMAWDRYN: My friends, do not despair. The Doctor will soon return. And of his own free will.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: You see, Brigadier, thanks to your imperfect memory there is now a Lethbridge Stewart some six years your junior at loose in this ship.\nBRIG '83: Good heavens. You mean that I did go with Nyssa and Tegan in the TARDIS in 1977?\nTEGAN: And were we glad of the company.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBRIG '77: This Doctor, what does he look like?\nTURLOUGH: Older than me, younger than you.\nBRIG '77: No, I mean, is he normal?\nTURLOUGH: Of course.\nBRIG '77: So, that deformed creature in the TARDIS was an imposter.\nTURLOUGH: Exactly.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, the Brigadier's here.\nBRIG '77: Doctor?\nBRIG '77: Turlough, what are you up to?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBRIG '77 (OOV.): Turlough!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: No sign of Turlough.\nBRIG '83: I never trusted that boy.\nNYSSA: He must be here somewhere.\nDOCTOR: Well, I hope so, because I've got to get the TARDIS away from here.\nNYSSA: And separate the two Brigadiers.\nBRIG '83: Ah, now, hang on a minute. I've been thinking about that.\nDOCTOR: There isn't time to think, Brigadier.\nBRIG '83: Doctor, we are talking about six years of my life.\nDOCTOR: Well, you're perfectly all right in 1983. Obviously your 1977 self came to no physical harm.\nBRIG '83: Well, maybe not, but I don't want to have spent a year or two in limbo on this ship.\nNYSSA: Look.\nDOCTOR: Stay here, all of you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Turlough, listen very carefully. We have a problem with the Brigadier.\nTURLOUGH: What is it?\nDOCTOR: The two time zones. The Brigadier did go with Tegan and Nyssa. There are now two Lethbridge Stewarts on this ship.\nTURLOUGH: I understand.\nDOCTOR: Now, I will take the Brigadier in the TARDIS back to 1983 Earth.\nTURLOUGH: And me?\nDOCTOR: You must find the other Brigadier and take him to the transmat capsule. You'll be quite safe, the mutants won't harm you.\nTURLOUGH: But the transmat beam doesn't work.\nDOCTOR: It will. The capsule is locked into the TARDIS' homing device. It will transmat to the centre of the TARDIS. I wired the device myself.\nTURLOUGH: Of course.\nDOCTOR: Now, when you arrive, whatever you do, stay in the capsule. Don't let the Brigadier out until I give you the word. Now, quickly.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNYSSA: Will the mutants really travel for the rest of time?\nDOCTOR: I'm afraid so.\nNYSSA: That's terrible.\nDOCTOR: Sometimes you have to live with the consequences of your actions. Now, let's get away from here.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMUTANT: The Time Lord has left us.\nMUTANT 2: Can we be certain he will return?\nMAWDRYN: He will return.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: It takes a remarkably cunning set of the coordinates to clear a warp ellipse.\nTEGAN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: This is a temperamental old thing, but I'm getting remarkably good at sorting\nNYSSA: Doctor, something's happening.\nDOCTOR: Not at all. We're on course for the Brigadier's school. You see, there was a problem with\nBRIG '83: Doctor!\nNYSSA: Doctor, do something.\nBRIG '83: What on Earth is happening?\nDOCTOR: I don't know.\nBRIG '83: It's like Mawdryn in the laboratory.\nDOCTOR: Mawdryn? That's it! They've been contaminated.\nTEGAN: Doctor, do something.\nDOCTOR: No, don't touch them. The transfiguration can be controlled.\nNYSSA: Stop!\nDOCTOR: Stop. That's it. Travelling through time is accelerating the degeneration.\nBRIG '83: You've stopped the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Well, more than that. We're going back to where we started. I just hope it induces a proportional remission.\nBRIG '83: It's working.\nDOCTOR: Are you two all right?\nNYSSA: I think so.\nTEGAN: Doctor, what went wrong?\nBRIG '83: Look at them out there. I'll bet they knew this was going to happen.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMUTANT: The Time Lord has returned, as you predicted.\nMAWDRYN: The Doctor is not with us yet. He will not give up so easily.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: You were infected when you carried Mawdryn into the TARDIS. The journey to his ship would have made it worse.\nTEGAN: Infected? You mean their mutation is a disease?\nDOCTOR: Well, it shouldn't be. I can only assume their constant experimenting to correct their error brought about a viral side effect.\nBRIG '83: Well, why haven't we got it?\nDOCTOR: I don't know.\nNYSSA: So we can't time travel.\nTEGAN: We don't need to. All we need to do is get the TARDIS back to Earth.\nDOCTOR: That won't work. I've got to programme a temporal deviation to escape the warp ellipse.\nBRIG '83: Are we stuck on this ship?\nDOCTOR: I wonder. If I reverse the polarity of the neutron flow\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBRIG '77: So, you've stopped pretending to be the Doctor.\nMAWDRYN: The Doctor is in the TARDIS.\nBRIG '77: What?\nMUTANT 2: This man also is in the TARDIS.\nMUTANT: He is a deviant.\nMUTANT 2: There has been temporal duplication.\nMAWDRYN: The TARDIS will soon return. The imbalance could be cataclysmic. For your own safety you must return to the Earth at once.\nBRIG '77: Without the TARDIS?\nMAWDRYN: Quickly.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBRIG '83: So far so good.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no.\nBRIG '83: But nothing's happening.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, it is.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMAWDRYN: You will return to Earth immediately in the transmat capsule.\nBRIG '77: How the deuce do you expect me to\nMAWDRYN: Get in.\nBRIG '77: Look, if you think I'm trusting myself to this bauble\nMAWDRYN: The capsule is programmed for Earth. Quickly.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNYSSA JR: It's no good, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: We're travelling in the opposite direction out of the ellipse. It's having a reverse effect.\nTEGAN JR: Stop! Stop!\nDOCTOR: Someone's trying to operate the transmat capsule. Must be Turlough taking your other half to the centre of the TARDIS.\nBRIG '83: Can the capsule do that?\nDOCTOR: Only when the TARDIS is clear of the ship. Until that happens, the transmat can't take place. The capsule will return to its terminal.\nDOCTOR: It's no good. I can't get clear of the ship without hurting Nyssa and Tegan.\nNYSSA: What are we going to do?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): You have failed me!\nTURLOUGH: No.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): The Brigadier is still free.\nTURLOUGH: That's not my fault.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): Why did you not transport him in the capsule, as the Doctor instructed.\nTURLOUGH: The Doctor? But I'm supposed to be working against him.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): Imbecile! Why should you not profit by the Time Lord's cunning?\nTURLOUGH: I'm sorry.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): So near the annihilation of the Doctor and you risk all with your negligence and stupidity.\nTURLOUGH: I can still keep the two Lethbridge Stewarts apart.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): If you fail me again, I shall destroy you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: We can't stay in the TARDIS for ever.\nBRIG '83: Well, Doctor?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNYSSA: You knew that would happen.\nMAWDRYN: Yes, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: You infected us. You passed on the mutative pattern.\nMAWDRYN: Yes, but not deliberately.\nTEGAN: What happens to us now?\nMAWDRYN: You will remain in the ship.\nTEGAN: For the rest of our lives?\nMAWDRYN: You're fortunate. Your journey will be short. Ours is without end.\nBRIG '83: We are not leaving them on this ship.\nMAWDRYN: Take them with you in the TARDIS and they will die.\nBRIG '83: Are you telling me that with all the facilities on this ship, you can't come up with some sort of antidote?\nMAWDRYN: We have no restorative for Tegan and Nyssa.\nBRIG '83: Doctor, have you got any ideas? ... You said in the laboratory that the Doctor could help you through that machinery.\nMAWDRYN: That is true, but only of his own free will.\nBRIG '83: Well then, surely he can do the same for Nyssa and Tegan.\nMAWDRYN: That is a question you must ask the Doctor.\nBRIG '83: Well, Doctor?\nTEGAN: Doctor?\nNYSSA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Take me to your laboratory.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMAWDRYN: The Doctor chose to involve himself. Soon he will be a Time Lord no longer. That is his reward for compassion.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBRIG '77: Doctor! Where is he?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: You will activate the energy transfer, Brigadier. It will take several moments for the charge in the machine to build up. You can read off the countdown to the moment of exchange. Are you all right?\nBRIG '83: Yes.\nMUTANT: Do not be afraid. When the moment comes, we will all share in the life force of the Doctor.\nMUTANT 2: Our mutation will end.\nMUTANT: You will no longer be contaminated.\nNYSSA: And the Doctor won't be a Time Lord any more.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: Brigadier? Brigadier!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMAWDRYN: My brothers in exile, we approach the ending.\nDOCTOR: Activate, Brigadier, now.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): So near the supreme moment! The Brigadiers must not converge. Stop him, or I shall destroy you all!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBRIG '83: Twenty seconds. Nineteen.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: Brigadier! Brigadier, come back!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBRIG '83: Thirteen, twelve, eleven\nBRIG '77: Doctor, Tegan. What the devil?\nDOCTOR: No, Brigadier, get out of here!\nBRIG '77: What do you think you're doing? Who on Earth?\nBRIG '83: I remember.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH (OOV.): It's cracked.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Are you all right?\nNYSSA: I think so.\nTEGAN: What happened?\nDOCTOR: A massive discharge of energy exactly synchronising with the moment of transfer.\nTEGAN: Is the Brigadier dead?\nDOCTOR: I don't think so.\nNYSSA: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It's all right, old friend.\nBRIG '83: Oh, sorry about that, Headmaster. Touch of vertigo. It won't happen again. What the devil's been going on?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, I want you to take the Brigadier back to the TARDIS, right to the centre, and keep him there until I give you the all clear. You'll be quite safe.\nTEGAN: This one must be all right. He belongs in 1977.\nDOCTOR: Amazing. The Brigadier's timing. A millisecond either way and\nTEGAN: And what?\nDOCTOR: At the moment of transfer, the power didn't come from me.\nTEGAN: Where did it come from?\nDOCTOR: Well, from the TARDIS, really. The two Brigadiers just shorted out the time differential.\nTEGAN: You mean zap?\nDOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Zap.\nTEGAN: Can Nyssa and I still time travel?\nDOCTOR: You're as good as new.\nTEGAN: Can you still regenerate?\nDOCTOR: I am a Time Lord.\nTEGAN: Look at Mawdryn.\nMAWDRYN: It is finished, Doctor. Can this be death?\nTEGAN: They're all dead.\nDOCTOR: They would have travelled for the rest of time, Tegan. Death was all they wanted. Come on, we must get the Brigadier back to 1977.\nTEGAN: Before we go, Doctor, thank you. You were prepared to risk everything for us.\nDOCTOR: Come on.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBRIG '83: Look, what's been going on?\nNYSSA: The Doctor will explain later.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: What's that noise?\nDOCTOR: The ship is dying with the mutants.\nTEGAN: It's come out of orbit?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Hurry.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRUNCIMAN: Brigadier?\nRUNCIMAN: Brigadier, what happened? I came as soon as I got your message.\nRUNCIMAN: You'll be all right.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBRIG '83: My word, you've been making some changes in here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: One has to move with the times. How are you feeling?\nBRIG '83: Haven't felt so well for, for at least six years.\nDOCTOR: There we are, 1983. Back to school, Brigadier.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Goodbye.\nBRIG '83: Goodbye, Doctor. If ever you're passing. Where's Turlough?\nDOCTOR: Turlough. He left in the capsule.\nNYSSA: He can't have done. If the Brigadier was still in the ship, he never used the transmat system.\nTEGAN: The auto-destruct! We've got to get back to the ship. Come on!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: Oh, Turlough.\nNYSSA: You're safe.\nTEGAN: We thought you were on Mawdryn's ship.\nTURLOUGH: I'm not that easy to get rid of.\nTEGAN: So it seems.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, may I join you?\nDOCTOR: I think you already have.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Now, we've returned, drawn by a witch who seeks to use my brother Klaus' unborn child as leverage in a brewing war. But his quest for power has turned brother against brother, leaving our family more divided than ever. Now that Elijah has returned, can our family unite to face this new threat?\nMIKAELSON MANSION\n[Klaus and Elijah sit opposite each other in the living room, both reading. Klaus is reading \"A Poison Tree\" by William Blake, and Elijah is reading one of his mother's grimoires. A dead girl lays on the coffee table as they listen to classical music. After a moment, Rebekah enters]\nRebekah: So, this is what you do the first time we're back together as a family? Vampire book club?\nKlaus: [continues reading] Reading edifies the mind, sister. Isn't that right, Elijah?\nElijah: Yes, that's quite right, Niklaus.\nRebekah: And what's this business? [gestures to the dead girl on the table]\nElijah: This is a...[gestures as though he's searching for a word]...peace offering.\nKlaus: I presumed, after so much time desiccating in a coffin, that my big brother might be a bit peckish.\nElijah: And I explained to my little brother, that forgiveness cannot be bought. I'd simply prefer to see a change in behavior that indicates contrition, and personal growth.\n[Klaus rolls his eyes guiltily, and Elijah gestures to the girl]\nElijah: Not this nonsense.\nKlaus: Well, I couldn't very well let her go to waste, could I? [grins]\nRebekah: Well, I suppose I'll go fetch the rubbish bin, because she's staining a two hundred-year-old carpet.\n[Elijah looks up from his book to see the girl bleeding out onto the table, where the blood drips onto the floor]\nElijah: Ah, yes.\nKlaus (voiceover): [recites \"A Poison Tree\" by William Blake]\nI was angry with my friend:\n[Klaus looks at Elijah]\nI told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my foe:\n[Marcel walks into the Palace Royale Hotel, looking for Klaus]\nI told it not, my wrath did grow And I watered it in fears,\n[Cami brings flowers to her brother's grave, to find that someone spray painted \"MURDERER\" over the headstone]\nNight and morning with my tears; And I sunned it with smiles,\n[Father Kieran pulls wooden boards off the windows of the church, and waves to a group of men standing outside the door]\nAnd with soft deceitful wiles.

[stomps through the kitchen and into the living room to clean up the mess]\nElijah: [digs around in a cupboard as Hayley pulls ice cream out of the freezer] You know, I do hope my siblings were hospitable to you, in my absence.\nHayley: In your absence, as you like to call it, which is a way-too-polite way of saying that your brother put a dagger in your heart...[looks up to see Elijah bringing a bowl, a spoon, and a bag of cereal to the counter] I have been attacked by French Quarter vampires, I've had to live in a house with a secret dungeon full of coffins, and I was nearly murdered by witches who are convinced my baby is Lucifer.\n[Elijah smiles sympathetically as he pulls orange juice and milk out of the fridge, pours Hayley a bowl of cereal, and then fills it with milk]\nHayley: [notices the milk] Oh...milk. [beat] They've been fine. Your siblings are weirdly protective, I know I have you to thank for that.\nElijah: I'm just happy to see that you're in one piece. [smiles] So, back to the murderous witches. [hands her the bowl of cereal] I have some concerns.\nHayley: They're evil. And, my life is still magically linked to Sophie Deveraux, which is not comforting.\nElijah: Yes, I think it's time we took care of that little problem.\nRebekah: I am all for it. As soon as they're unlinked, we get to leave this crap town.

I'm the only witch who still likes you.\nSophie: [stirs gumbo] Yeah, it's not like I'm trying to save the witch heritage or anything. [turns to Sabine]\nSabine: They'll come around. They're just old-school, and scared.\nSophie: Scared of what? Your prophecy about the hybrid baby? Agnes and her freak-show minions had a real field day with that one.\nSabine: I can't help what I see, Soph. [shakes head]\nSophie: [smiles] Well, if you're psychic, I'm Martha Stewart!

I thought we'd begin with a little unlinking spell.\n[Rebekah and Klaus look at each other in confusion]\nRebekah: [stunned] Wait, you want to use her to unlink Hayley from Sophie Deveraux?\nElijah: Sophie brought us here under false pretenses! She doesn't just want us to take down Marcel and his minions, she wants to take Davina back. So, she yolked her own cause to ours, with magic threats and half-truths! Well, no more. As of now, our deal with Sophie Deveraux is null and void.\n[Klaus and Rebekah grin]\nElijah: Niklaus, I need you to come with me. I need five minutes alone with Davina, you need to make certain that I am not interrupted. [points to Rebekah and thinks for a moment] You stay here and watch Hayley.\nRebekah: How did I get elected super-nanny?\nKlaus: More importantly, who put him in charge? [follows Elijah out of the room]\nNIGHTWALKER BAR\n[Marcel sits alone, drinking a bottle of scotch, as various vampires around him feed on humans at the tables around him. Josh sees Marcel, and approaches him]\nJosh: Hey. Is everything okay?\n[Marcel gives him a look]\nJosh: Uh, can I get you something?\nMarcel: Look, I know you want a daylight ring, kid. Little heads up? I got guys eighty years ahead of you.\nJosh: [nods nervously] Noted. Sorry.\nMarcel: [watches him walk away] Wait! You know Klaus Mikaelson. I asked you to give him a lift home a couple of times? To the Palace Royale Hotel, right?\nJosh: [stammers] Uhhh, yeah...the Palace Royale.\nMarcel: See, I stopped by his hotel, to say sorry about an argument we had. Turns out he lied about living there. Lied! Do you ever hear the phrase, \"Uneasy is the head that wears the crown?\"\nJosh: Uhhh...Lord of the Rings?\nMarcel: No, Shakespeare. When I was a kid, Klaus taught me how to read with those plays. All about a king who gained the world, but lost his soul. But now, I get it! You see, when it's all said and done, and you look around at the empire you built, the only thing that matters is who you can trust!\nJosh: There's gotta be somebody, somewhere that you can trust? \"To stick to you, through thick and thin, to the bitter end.\" Sam and Frodo, The Fellowship of the Ring. [shrugs]\nMarcel: [nods slowly] Yeah, there is someone. We used to be best friends. [pats Josh on the arm as he leaves]\nDAVINA'S ATTIC ROOM\nDavina is sketching with charcoal on her easel when Elijah arrives and leans against the doorway and knocks on the door. Davina smiles]\nElijah: [holds up pages of grimoire in a cloth] I made you a promise.\nDavina: [smiles] Come in!\nST. ANN'S CATHOLIC CHURCH\n[Cami sits in the confession room with Father Kieran]\nCami: Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been...oh, a year, since I've had a good conversation with you.\nKieran: Camille.\nCami: You've been avoiding me, Uncle K.\nKieran: My favorite niece? Never!\nCami: Don't lie. This is a church! [beat] Besides, I came about professional advice. [beat] About Sean.\nDAVINA'S ATTIC ROOM\n[Davina spreads a page of Esther's grimoire on her table]\nDavina: It's a spell of unknotting?\nElijah: This is a sanguinum knot. The witches use it as representational magic. If you can unknot this using that spell, you will have taken a step towards learning control. This is one of my mother's later spells. It requires much more power than you realize. Now, if you can perform this, then I shall return with another page. [walks toward the door, then turns back to her] A spell of your choosing, next time. [smiles, then leaves]\nST. ANN'S CATHOLIC CHURCH\n[Cami and Father Kieran are still in the confessional]\nCami: I guess since I'm a masochist, I went by Sean's grave today and--\nKieran: Damn it, I was hoping to get that cleaned up before you saw it. I hope it didn't upset you too much.\nCami: It didn't bother me at all. That's the problem. That's why I'm here. I slept like a baby every night this week. Even though my brother hacked nine priests to death, not two feet from this confessional. [beat] A guy I've been seeing, Marcel, has been blowing me off. Whatever, I've been on two dates with the guy, and I'm more upset about THAT than seeing \"MURDERER\" scrawled across my brother's grave.\nKieran: [hesitates] It's called healing, Cami.\nCami: For months, after the massacre, I couldn't think of anything else. And then suddenly...nothing. I need to feel that pain! Without it, I feel...broken! Empty! Like, there's someone to blame...and...I'm letting them get away with it.\nKieran: Listen, if you have found a way to turn it off, don't question it! The only person that is responsible for Sean's behavior is...Sean.\nCami: Do you really believe that?\nKieran: Yes. I do.\n[Cami stares at her uncle through the screen for a moment, before she gets up and walks out of the church. Kieran sighs. Up in the balcony, Klaus watches Cami leave, and frowns]\nLAFAYETTE CEMETERY MAUSOLEUM\n[Sophie is awake now, and struggling against the grips of the masked people who knocked her out. The masked people shackle Sophie to chains hanging from the ceiling]\nSophie: Let go of me!\n[Agnes enters with a bag and sets it on a table]\nAgnes: Leave her be.\nSophie: Killing me to get to Klaus, or his baby is not the answer!\nAgnes: [roots through her bag] I'm not gonna kill you Sophie, I was there the day you were born. I am the last remaining Elder of our coven. It is my duty to protect our power, and our power means nothing if that baby grows another day. [turns to face Sophie] Sabine's omen was clear. That baby will bring death to us all.\nSophie: [scared] What are you gonna do?\n[Agnes holds up a large, old-looking metal syringe with a long needle]\nSophie: [terrified] No, no, Agnes, no. No, no, don't!\n[Agnes holds Sophie's head down and stabs the needle into her neck]\nMIKAELSON MANSION\n[In her bedroom, Hayley yells in pain as she grasps her neck. When she pulls her hand away, she notices blood on her fingers. Rebekah hears her shout, and walks in]\nHayley: AHH!\nRebekah: What the hell was that?\nHayley: Hell if I know, it felt like I was being stabbed.\n[Hayley and Rebekah get a dawning realization that something bad is happening]\nROUSSEAU'S\n[Elijah and Klaus find Sabine on the floor of the kitchen and Elijah helps her up]\nElijah: [gruffly] What happened?\nSabine: It was Agnes. [rubs head as she looks around] Her men took Sophie.\nKlaus: Day one with you in charge, brother, and already the witch linked to Hayley has been abducted by zealots.\nElijah: [to Sabine] Where is she?\nSabine: If I tell you where Agnes is, you'll just kill her.\nKlaus: Isn't that obvious?\nSabine: Look, I know she's a little...coo-coo, but she's our last living Elder. That might not mean a lot to you, but it means plenty to us. The Elders are the one ones who can do important spells.\nElijah: Like completing the Harvest ritual?\nSabine: [confused] You know about that?\nElijah: Oh, you'd be astounded by the things I know.\nKlaus: [to Sabine] Allow me to entertain you with today's list of priorities. One, unlink your friend Sophie so she no longer controls the fate of the woman carrying my child. Two, convince my brother to accept my heartfelt apologies for some recently dodgy behavior. Three...there is no three.\nElijah: I believe what my brother is attempting to communicate, here, is that neither the life of this Elder, nor the Harvest ritual, nor your coven's connection to magic are of any relevance to him, whatsoever. [beat] Now talk.\nTHE GARDEN\n[Marcel walks through the gate to the Garden, and approaches Thierry's \"cell\" amid the groans of pain of the other \"inmates.\"]\nMarcel: Thierry.\nThierry: [weak and groggy] Marcel. Come to punish me again?\nMarcel: Someone asked if there was anyone I ever trusted. I only came up with one name. You. So, Thierry, you and I are gonna have a little talk about Klaus Mikaelson. [grabs a sledgehammer and starts to break down the wall of bricks surrounding Thierry]\nMIKAELSON MANSION\n[Rebekah enters a room where Hayley is sitting in an armchair]\nRebekah: Time for the demon spawn to snack!\nHayley: I really wish you wouldn't call her that.\nRebekah: Oh, sorry, have you picked another name yet? [holds out basket of fruit] Take one, the plantation's lousy with them.\n[Hayley chooses an apple and grasps it in her hand]\nHayley: I feel fine...which is weird. I'm sure it's Sophie-related.\nRebekah: Then, do me a favor, and don't die on my watch! I'll never hear the end of it.\nHayley: You know, when I first met you, I thought you were a real bitch.\nRebekah: [smiles] What changed your mind?\nHayley: Oh, I still think you're a bitch! [smiles] I've just grown to like that about you.\nRebekah: [chuckles] Aw, well, that's sweet of you to say. [face turns serious] Remember it when I'm gone.\nHayley: Gone? Where are you going?\nRebekah: I only came to town to make sure everything was okay with Elijah. He's fine, and he hasn't punished Klaus for daggering him, so...as usual, they'll be thick as thieves, and I'll be left to clean up the mess. [beat] It's time for me to fly the coop.\nHayley: Oh...[goes to bite the apple, but then starts to feel woozy]\nRebekah: [frowns] What's wrong?\nHayley: [shakes head] I dunno, probably morning sickness...\nRebekah: [places hand on Hayley's forehead] Oh, you're burning up, actually.\nLAFAYETTE CEMETERY\n[Klaus and Elijah have found Sophie, and they break Sophie free from her chains]\nSophie: [groans in pain as shackles break] Agnes stuck me with a needle. Cursed objects were created a long time ago. We use them so we don't get busted by Marcel for doing magic. The one she used is called the Needle of Sorrows. It was cursed in 1860 when...\nKlaus: Jump ahead a few decades and tell us what it does, love?\nSophie: It has only one purpose: to kill a child in utero by raising her blood temperature.\n[Klaus and Elijah are both stunned and furious]\nElijah: It's for a miscarriage.\n[Sophie nods]\nElijah: So, how much time do we have to fix this?\nSophie: It will do what it's meant to by tonight's high tide. And believe me, it will work. I saw her use a similar object on a kid who went mad and killed a bunch of priests.\nKlaus: I'd like to have a chat with this Agnes. Where can I find her?\nSophie: You won't! There are a thousand places she could hole up to wait it out.\nElijah: That's precisely why we need to unlink you from Hayley. No more danger toward her or the child.\nSophie: [shakes head in confusion] No, what? If I am not linked to Hayley, I lose my leverage on you. We had a deal!\nElijah: We are not on the same side, Sophie Deveraux. Our deal no longer stands!\n[Sophie is outraged]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTHE GARDEN\n[Marcel hands Thierry, who is sitting on a step, a canteen of blood, and sits down beside him]\nThierry: Does this mean you're pardoning me?\nMarcel: Aw, you know I can't do that. You broke my number one rule, you killed a vampire, T. I let that go, it'll make me look weak.\nThierry: [chugs blood] I warned you about Klaus.\nMarcel: Yeah, I should've listened. This guy's been in my town for months, but hiding where he lays his head at night. What else is he hiding, is what I want to know! I didn't listen to you before, but I sure as hell am now. Tell me what happened the night that got you put in here, and you might find yourself out by Mardi Gras.\nThierry: The night of the Masquerade Party, you sent us rousting in the Cauldron to mess with the witches. So, when Max came in rousting, he went straight for Katie's throat. Now, you said to roust, you didn't say to kill. Now, he's a nightwalker. I'm a daywalker. I told him to stop, and he wouldn't. So I stopped him. That night's on endless loop in my head. I think Max was compelled.\nMarcel: No. All my guys are on vervain.\nThierry: Not if Klaus drained him! Max went missing for a couple days before the rousting, right?\nMarcel: T, they found stuff you and your girl stole from me in her shop.\nThierry: Have you ever been in the Jardin Gris? You can't find your own hand in front of your face in there! And yet somehow, someone went in there, and after a couple minutes, found some stolen goods?\n[Marcel wipes at his face anxiously, but he is obviously considering Thierry's words]\nThierry: Go there! See for yourself! But I'm telling you, besides Max, somebody else in the crew had to be compelled. Watch your back. [takes another swig from the canteen]\nST. ANN'S CATHOLIC CHURCH\n[Father Kieran has put up a \"Substance Abuse Anonymous\" sign in order to meet with some city officials]\nMayor: So, a few tourists go missing. Okay, we can spin it, no problem. But do you know how hard it is to sell a gas leak story to the city council when a bunch of church windows magically explode?\nFather Kieran: Mr. Mayor, what is this, an electoral debate? Marcel overstepped, I will handle it.\n[Klaus enters through front doors]\nKlaus: Easier said than done. Marcel is quite the little warrior.\n[Police officer tries to stop him, but Klaus breaks his fingers]\nMayor: Who the hell are you?\nKlaus: My name is Klaus. And you lot are the Faction. Pillars of the community who maintain the city's supernatural balance. Well, I should know. I created this group. Only, in my day, it was a bunch of pirates and corrupt politicians. [looks around at all the men] Looks like nothing's changed.\nKieran: One thing has: it's exclusively human now. No vampires allowed, especially no Originals.\nKlaus: [laughs] I haven't come to join! I've come to ask this group to utilize it's considerable resources to find a witch Elder called Agnes. All I need is an address.\nKieran: And, uh, why would we want to help you?\nKlaus: What if I told you that Agnes was the answer to a question you've been asking since you ran screaming from this town? That she is the witch who hexed your nephew, Sean?\nKieran: We'd need some time to discuss--\nKlaus: I DON'T. HAVE. TIME.\n[Kieran chuckles]\nKlaus: Nor do I like being asked to wait.\nKieran: You may have all the vampires in this town cowering in fear, but right now, you are dealing with the humans. And unless you plan on killing all of us, I politely suggest you do as I say, and give us time to discuss it. [gestures widely to the other men in the room]\nKlaus: [leans in and lowers voice] You know what I like about you, Father? Is you're aware of our reputation, and yet still, you stand tall against me. [beat] Admirable! You have one hour. [turns to leave]\nKieran: [speaks once Klaus is gone] I want that witch. Cell phone records, our guys in the 9th.\nMayor: For the vampire?\nKieran: [sighs] No. For me.\nDAVINA'S ATTIC ROOM\n[Davina continues to work on the unlinking spell Elijah gave her. She holds her hands over the knot and reads from the page]\nDavina: Phesmatos omnio legares coldate sangorium.\n[Davina stares at the knot, which doesn't change. She exhales in frustration and runs her hand through her hair before angrily hitting her easel]\nMIKAELSON MANSION\n[Hayley lays in bed as Rebekah blots sweat from her forehead and chest]\nRebekah: Stop fussing, will you? Elijah will be here any minute.\nHayley: I feel like I've been microwaved.\nRebekah: Hey! Just because you're carrying a baby, doesn't mean you get to act like one! I'm sure my little niece is healing you up as we speak.\n[Elijah runs in with Sophie. Rebekah stands to greet them]\nRebekah: What the hell is she doing here?\nSophie: [sighs] I'm trying to help.\nRebekah: Help? You're the reason we're in this bloody mess! Why aren't we unlinked with this witch already, Elijah?\nElijah: Rebekah, let her do what she can.\nSophie: I may know a way to slow the fever down. But, I'm gonna need some special herbs. [to Rebekah] I'll text you a list.\n[Elijah nods at her in encouragement, and she finally relents]\nRebekah: [smiles patronizingly] Fine. Happy to play the fetch girl.\n[Rebekah stomps out of the room, and shoves the towel she was using into Elijah's chest as she leaves]\nJARDIN GRIN VOODOO SHOP\n[Rebekah frantically rifles through bottles and jars, looking for the herbs she needs to help Hayley, when Marcel walks in]\nMarcel: Isn't this Katie's shop?\n[Rebekah stops, rolls her eyes, and sighs as she goes back to looking for the herbs]\nMarcel: She leave you the keys in her will, or maybe it's just Help-Yourself Tuesday? [beat] What are you doing here?\nRebekah: You know, I read if you mix mugwort with sage, you've got quite a vampire-repellant? Wards off even the most resilient pest. Why are you here?\nMarcel: Just keeping my city safe from thieves and vandals. But, everytime I turn around, I catch an Original with their hand in the cookie jar!\nRebekah: Well, luckily for you, your \"cookies\" are the last thing on my mind.\nMarcel: Oh, I can see that! [walks toward her] Though, I can think of a time when things were different.\nRebekah: Maybe once. Not anymore. [finds the herbs she needs] Camphor, found it! [quickly exits the shop]\nST. ANN'S CATHOLIC CHURCH\n[Father Kieran receives a text message from Chief Sullivan that reads, \"3631 CHARBONNET ST. LOWER 9TH WARD.\" He puts his phone in his pocket and goes to leave, but he's stopped by Klaus]\nKlaus: Going somewhere?\nFather Kieran: [nervously] You're early.\nKlaus: Well, it's a good thing I am. You seem hell-bent on enacting vengeance all on your lonesome. The trouble is, I need something from Agnes before you send her off to meet her maker. So, I propose we strike a deal! [sits down in a pew] Bring her here! In exchange, I'll even ensure your niece, Cami, remains safe. Oh, I'd so hate for her to get caught up in all of this.\n[Later, Agnes is handcuffed and brought to the church by police officers]\nAgnes: This is outrageous! What is the charge?\n[The officers sit her in a pew and leave]\nKieran: Please, Agnes. You know that Marcel runs the vampires in this town.\n[He is handed a folded cloth by the officer, which is revealed to hold the Needle of Sorrows]\nKieran: Who do you think runs everything else? [holds the needle up and calls out to Klaus] I believe this is what you were looking for?\nKlaus: [zooms to Kieran's side] Hello, Agnes.\nAgnes: You made a deal with HIM?\nKieran: After what you did to Sean, I'd deal with the devil himself just to make you suffer!\nAgnes: [stands up and gets in Kieran's face] You can't hurt me, the entire witch community will turn against you!\nKlaus: ENOUGH! Please, enough! I don't care about witch politics. I don't care about your ridiculous little Harvest ritual. What I care about is this trinket. [holds up Needle of Sorrows] Undo its curse, or I'll show you things worse than death!\nAgnes: [smirks] Dark objects don't come with an off-switch! The curse took root in Sophie, she's linked to your devil child. It's just a matter of time!\nMIKAELSON MANSION\n[Hayley is wrapped in a towel, sitting outside beside the swimming pool. Rebekah stands behind her, checking her temperature, while Elijah assists Sophie in helping with the herbs]\nElijah: [removes his coat] She's burning up! We need to do this now.\nSophie: Get her in the water!\n[Elijah jumps into the pool and helps Hayley in. Sophie mixes herbs in a cup and follows them in]\nRebekah: I don't see how a midnight swim is supposed to help.\nSophie: Her temperature is sky-high. The water, with the help of the herbs, should cool us down. [gets into the pool and hands Hayley a drink] Drink this! [to Elijah] You're going to have to get her heart rate down.\nElijah: How do you suggest I do that?\nSophie: Hold her. It's a natural human remedy to slow the heart rate and reduce blood pressure.\nRebekah: This is never gonna work.\nElijah: [holding Hayley bridal-style in the pool] Davina will break the link, we just need time.\n[Hayley clings to Elijah and groans as she gasps for breath]\nDAVINA'S ATTIC ROOM / MIKAELSON MANSION SWIMMING POOL\n[Davina is sitting on her bed, studying the spell intently. She stares at the sanguinum knot on her vanity, and after a moment, she stands up and walks over to it. She picks up the knot with both hands and takes a breath]\nDavina: [whispers] Phesmatos omnio legares cardate...\n[In the swimming pool, Hayley hyperventilates]\nHayley: I can't breathe!\nElijah: Okay, long deep breaths, Hayley! Look at me. Long deep breaths, just focus on the sound of my voice. [whispers] You'll be okay. You'll be okay.\nDavina: Phesmatos omnio legares cardate sangorium.\n[The clock on her table chimes as it hits 09:00PM]\nHayley: AHHHH! AHHHH!\n[The knot in Davina's hands floats in the air and begins to unknot itself]\n[Sophie starts to gasp as the linking spell begins to lift. Hayley continues to groan in pain]\n[The knot completely unravels itself in midair, and Davina smiles and giggles in happiness]\nSophie: [looks up at the sky] I just felt it lift.\n[Rebekah sighs in relief. Hayley starts to calm down, and Elijah looks stunned. Hayley stands up on her own, but still leans against Elijah. Sophie removes one of her earrings and pokes her palm with it. Hayley doesn't get injured. Elijah holds her hand and he and Hayley stare at each other. Rebekah notices their shared moment, so Elijah quickly lets go and leads Hayley out of the pool]\nElijah: Come on, let's go.\nSophie: Elijah...as soon as your brother finds out that the link is broken, he'll kill Agnes. I know you don't owe me anything, but please, don't let him kill her.\n[Elijah zooms out of the pool and pulls his phone out of his jacket on the table]\nSophie: Elijah! She's our only access to the power we NEED to survive. Promise me that you'll stop him!\nElijah: [dials a number into his phone and raises it to his ear] It's me, where are you? [beat] Don't hurt her. I'll be there shortly. [hangs up and turns to Sophie] I'll make you one last promise. I won't let my brother kill Agnes.\n[Sophie nods at him, and Elijah picks up his jacket and shoes and walks away. Sophie and Hayley turn to get out of the pool, but Hayley stops Sophie at the steps]\nHayley: I know you were just using me to save your people, but try it again, and I'll kill you.\n[Hayley leaves, and Sophie sighs in defeat]\nMIKAELSON MANSION\n[Rebekah walks into Elijah's bedroom as he's finishing getting dressed in dry clothes, and stands in the doorway]\nRebekah: [smiles] The unlinking worked! Maybe now we can make plans--\nElijah: Not now, Rebekah. Can we discuss this when I return? [walks toward the door in a hurry]\nRebekah: [face turns serious] I won't be here when you return.\nElijah: [stops walking and turns to Rebekah] That sounds like a goodbye.\nRebekah: ...I guess it is. I only came to New Orleans to make sure you were safe. You are. I thought that I might be able to convince you to come with me, but here you are, rushing into whatever Klaus and Marcel and the witches have cooked up. And I finally get it. [tears up] You'll never leave this city. You'll never leave Klaus.\nElijah: [looks at her, and then walks toward her] Then you should stay.\nRebekah: [shakes head] This thing that you and Klaus and Marcel have, I want no part of it. [tears fall down her cheeks] I just want to be free.\nElijah: [sadly] Well, then, go. [kisses her on the cheek] You are free!\n[Elijah leaves, and Rebekah tries to compose herself]\nTHE ABBATOIR\n[Marcel finishes his drink as Rebekah walks into the room]\nMarcel: Rebekah. Twice in one night.

Smart girl. [beat] Have a nice life.\nRebekah: He's staying. And I'm not running, I'm disembarking a sinking ship.\nMarcel: People have been saying this city's been sinking since I was a boy. It ain't going anywhere. But hey! [grabs bottle of scotch] How 'bout one for the road? [pours a glass]\nRebekah: Why? So you can liquor me up and convince me to stay?\nMarcel: [stands up and gets in her face] Why else did you come here?\nRebekah: I came to say goodbye.\nMarcel: [whispers in her ear] Then say it.\n[The stare into each other's eyes for a moment]\nRebekah: Forget it.\n[She turns to leave, but Marcel grabs her wrist and pulls him toward her, kissing her.

But, guess what? I'm quite a piece of work myself. You know, I contemplated leaving bits of you artfully arranged outside your family's tomb? I thought it would leave a fitting message. [zooms over to Agnes and pulls her up into a chokehold] Don't. Touch. My. Family.\n[Elijah enters and approaches them]\nElijah: Leave her.\n[Klaus pulls Agnes into a headlock and stands back as he watches Elijah walk down the aisle]\nElijah: I gave my word.\n[Father Kieran stands up to greet Elijah]\nKlaus: You tend to give your word at the most inopportune times, brother. We've been doing things your way all day. Come on! Just one little snap and it's \"Toodle-loo, Agnes.\" She deserves it!\nElijah: Niklaus, don't make another move. You have asked for my forgiveness. I will grant you that forgiveness, but do not make me break my word.\n[Klaus glares at his brother as he considers it. After a moment, he lets Agnes go]\nKlaus: [opens arms wide] My noble brother, how was that for personal growth, eh? Still, it is just like you to spoil all of my fun.\nElijah: [stares Agnes in the eyes] Oh, not exactly.\n[Elijah zooms over to one of the men who helped Agnes and rips his heart out, throws a second man up into the air, and does the same to a third as he rips out the man's heart. He turns to Klaus with a bloody heart in each hand, and drops them to the floor. He pulls out his pocket square to wipe his hands as Agnes stares in horror, and Klaus grins proudly behind her]\nElijah: Now, I swore you would not die by my brother's hand. I said nothing of my own.

I've been away from this home almost a hundred years, and you haven't changed a thing in my bedroom.\nMarcel: [smiles] I guess I was holding out hope that you'd come back to it. Though, I imagine it's not quite as comfortable as those beds at the Palace Royale Hotel.\nRebekah: [smiles awkwardly] It's plenty comfortable! [turns to her bag] I'm famished!\n[She pulls an apple out of her bag and offers it to him]\nMarcel: Nah, apples aren't my thing.\nRebekah: They were your favorite, one upon a time.\nMarcel, Ah, they were! I'd get my ass beat if I ever ate them working on that plantation. Even the spoiled ones. Now, they just remind me of a time when I couldn't have things.\nRebekah: [leans against Marcel and grabs his arms] Well, now you can have whatever you want. [beat] Come with me.\nMarcel: And go where, Rebekah?\nRebekah: Wherever we want to! We can build a home together, we can leave behind Klaus, this city, and those Orphan-Annie vampires...\nMarcel: Whoa, whoa, those \"Orphan-Annie vampires\" are my family, and this city is my home.\nRebekah: It was my home, too, once. I left.\nMarcel: You ran. I stayed! This empire thrives because of me, and you want me to run? A man does not run from his home!\nRebekah: I've lived a lot longer than you have, Marcellus. I have seen kings rise, and fall, but there is one thing I know to be true. It is that no matter how matter how big your empire becomes, it is nothing if you have no one to share it with. [she glares at him] You want New Orleans? Have it. I won't be here to stop you. [shoves the apple into his chest and leaves]\n[Marcel stares out at the street as he thinks about what just happened.

[shuts door]\n[Josh walks away from the house, not knowing that Marcel is standing behind the tree, and has heard the entire conversation. Marcel sees a bunch of apples that have fallen from the apple tree and onto the ground. He picks one up, and we flashback to when Marcel was just a young boy, and was being whipped by a slavemaster. Young Marcel picks up an apple and lobs it at the man in anger. Marcel looks at the apple in his hand, and then looks over at the door]\n[Someone knocks on the door again. Hayley goes to answer, thinking it's Josh again, but it's Marcel]\nHayley: Ugh, what the hell, Josh? [opens door to find Marcel and is startled]\nMarcel: [smiles] Hi there, I'm Marcel.

No. [looks at Klaus, and his compulsion kicks in] Yes. You promised you'd find out what happened to Sean.\nKlaus: And I kept my word. Your twin brother's behavior was not born of natural causes.

The ship is still as there is not enough wind to fill the sails though a small breeze blows the array of charms hanging like chimes.\nEXT. SHIP'S DECK, NIGHT\nThe pirates climb aboard and are greeted by another.\nPIRATE 1: What's wrong?\nPIRATE 2: Man wounded.\nStunned, PIRATE 1 looks at the wounded man even as he points to the aft of the ship.\nPIRATE 1: Wake him.\nPIRATE 2 leaves.\nINT. SHIP, CAPTAIN'S CABIN, NIGHT\nWe see gold and jewels spilling over chests. The pirates are there, waiting on the CAPTAIN'S decision.\nPIRATE 1: He slipped in the bilge water, Cap'n, and fell on to the rigger. His hand... I don't know if he'll survive.\nThe CAPTAIN turns around and looks at the WOUNDED MAN'S hand. There is a small scratch on his finger.\nCAPTAIN: You're a dead man, McGrath.\nThe CAPTAIN turns over McGRATH'S hand to reveal a black spot on his palm.\nCAPTAIN: Same as all the others.\nA hypnotic woman's voice can be heard singing.\nCAPTAIN: She's here.\nPIRATE 1: Oh, save our souls.\nMcGRATH: I've got to escape! (runs from the cabin)\nPIRATE 1: Don't go out there! McGrath! Don't listen for God's sake. The siren is a-calling.\nEXT. SHIP'S DECK, NIGHT\nMcGRATH runs onto the deck, tripping on coiled rope.\nINT. SHIP, CAPTAIN'S CABIN, NIGHT\nThe CAPTAIN locks the cabin door. He then takes a pendant from his neck and wraps the leather strap around the door handles. On one side of the pendant is a carved relief of a mermaid.\nEXT. SHIP'S DECK, NIGHT\nMcGRATH holds his knife in one hand, ready to strike. He uses his other hand to try and block out the singing.\nINT. SHIP, CAPTAIN'S CABIN, NIGHT\nThe others hear his scream as the pendant slowly swings at the lock.\nEXT. SHIP'S DECK, NIGHT\nThe other pirates come out on deck. There is no sign of McGrath, only his pistol.\nCAPTAIN: (picks up pistol) Same as all the others. No sign of a struggle. No bones or blood.\nPIRATE 1: We're shark bait, every single one of us. Stuck on the ocean, waiting until the wind changes. There is a banging from one of the hatches.\nCAPTAIN: What's that?\nPIRATE 1: The creature, it's returned.\nThe pirates approach cautiously, the CAPTAIN aims the pistol. The hatch bursts open to reveal the DOCTOR, RORY and AMY.\nDOCTOR: Yo ho ho! Or does nobody actually say that?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMatt Smith Karen Gillan Arthur Darvil\n\"The Curse of the Black Spot\" by Steve Thompson\nProducer Marcus Wilson\nDirector Jeremy Webb\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. SHIP, HOLD, NIGHT\nThe TARDIS rests among the storage.\nINT. SHIP, CAPTAIN'S CABIN, NIGHT\nThe CAPTAIN is questioning the presence of strangers on his ship.\nCAPTAIN: We made no signal.\nDOCTOR: Our sensors picked you up. Ship in distress.\nCAPTAIN: Sensors?\nDOCTOR: Yes. OK. Problem word. Seventeenth century. My ship automatically, er..noticed-ish... that your ship was having some bother.\nCAPTAIN: That big blue crate!?\nThe DOCTOR snaps his fingers.\nPIRATE 1: Tis more magic, Captain Avery. They're spirits. How else would they have found their way below decks?\nDOCTOR: Well, I want to say multidimensional engineering, but since you had a problem with sensors I won't go there. Look, I'm the Doctor, this is Amy, Rory. We're pirates, same as you. Arghhhhh!\nThe DOCTOR turns to look at the pirates behind them and when he turns around, AVERY has a pistol aimed at his head.\nDOCTOR: Except for the gun thing. And the beardiness.\nAVERY: You're stowaways! Only explanation. Eight days, we've been stranded here. Becalmed. You must have stowed away before we sailed.\nPIRATE 1: What do we do with 'em?\nAVERY: Oh, I think they deserve our hospitality.\nEXT. SHIP'S DECK, NIGHT\nThe DOCTOR is standing at the edge of a plank jutting over the side of the ship. The pirates laugh.\nDOCTOR: I suppose that laughing like that is in the job description. \"Can you do the laugh?\" Check. Grab yourself a parrot. Welcome aboard.\nAVERY: Stocks are low. Only one barrel of water remains. We don't need three more empty bellies to fill. Take the doxy below to the galley. Set her to work. She won't need much feeding.\nOne of the pirates \"escorts\" AMY to the stairs that lead below-decks.\nAMY: Rory, a little help?\nRORY is being restrained by another pirate.\nRORY: Hey, listen right. She's not a doxy.\nAMY: I didn't mean just tell him off. Thanks anyway.\nThe pirate forces her below.\nAVERY: If you're lucky you'll drown before the sharks can take a bite.\nDOCTOR: If this is just because I'm a captain too, you shouldn't feel threatened. Your ship is much bigger than mine. And I don't have the cool boots. Or a hat, even.\nAVERY: (aims pistol) Time to go.\nDOCTOR: A Bit more laughter, guys? (motions with hand)\nINT. SHIP, BELOW-DECKS, NIGHT\nAMY opens a chest and finds it filled with swords. She takes one out and as she's testing the feel of it in her hand, she sees a long coat and a tricorne hanging on a peg.\nEXT. SHIP'S DECK, NIGHT\nDOCTOR: Where are the rest of the crew? This is a big ship. Big for five of you. I s'pose the rest of them are hiding some place (holds his nose) and they're going to jump out and shout \"boo\".\nAMY: Boo!\nThe men turn around to see AMY wearing the coat and hat, sword pointed at AVERY's throat.\nAMY: Throw the gun down.\nAVERY drops the gun to the deck and AMY kicks it away.\nAMY: The rest of you, on your knees.\nDOCTOR: Amy? What are you doing?\nAMY: Saving your life. OK with that, are you?\nAVERY: Put down the sword. A sword could kill us all, girl.\nAMY: Yep, thanks. That is actually why I'm pointing it at you.\nOne of the pirates comes at AMY with a wooden handle, surprising her and forcing her back from AVERY. When the DOCTOR tries to intercede, AVERY pushes him back into the rigging. When AMY advances on the pirates with the sword, they back away, gasping in fear. AMY shows off a little, swishing the sword through the air. The pirates take advantage and push forward again. AMY fights them off. One advances on her with a rope, backing her into a corner. AMY swings through the air on a piece of rigging, swing her sword. She cuts one of them as she passes before landing on a barrel.\nPIRATE 3: You have killed me.\nAMY: No way. It's just a cut.\nA black spot appears on PIRATE 3's hand.\nAMY: What kind of rubbish pirates are you?\nAVERY: One drop, that's all it takes. One drop of blood and she will rise out of the ocean.\nAMY: Come on. I barely even scratched him. What are you all in such a huff about?\nOne of the pirates approaches her and she swings out on the rope. He stops her and the sword flies from her hand. RORY tries to catch it, but cuts his hand. A black spot appears on his palm.\nRORY: Doctor? What's happening to me?\nAVERY: She can smell the blood on your skin. She's marked you for death.\nRORY: She?\nAVERY: A demon, out there in the ocean.\nDOCTOR: OK. Groovy. So not just pirates today. We've managed to bagsy a ship where there's a demon popping in. (looks at RORY'S hand) Very efficient. I mean if something's going to kill you, it's nice that it drops you a note to remind you.\nThe SIREN'S song starts again.\nPIRATE 1: Quickly now. Block out the sound.\nThe others put their hands over their ears.\nRORY: What?\nAVERY: The creature. She charms all her victims with that song.\nRORY: Oh, great, so put my fingers in my ears. That's your plan? Doctor, come on let's go lets get back to the...back to the... (starts acting dopey and giggles)\nPIRATE 1: The music. It's working on him. Look.\nRORY: (to AMY) You are so beautiful.\nAMY: What?\nRORY: I love your get up. That's great. You should dress as a pirate more often. Cuddle me, shipmate.\nAMY: Rory, stop.\nRORY: Everything is totally brilliant isn't it? Look at these brilliant pirates. Look at their brilliant beards. I'd like a beard. I'm going to grow a beard.\nAMY: You're not.\nAVERY: The music turns them into fools.\nRORY and the other wounded pirate continue to act like they're drunk or high.\nAMY: Oh, my God.\nOff the starboard side of the ship, a section of the water glows green. Everyone watches and soon a woman rises from the water. She, too, glows green. RORY'S jaw drops at the sight of her. AMY grabs his arm and holds him back as the SIREN floats down to the deck. PIRATE 3 walks towards her and the others half-heartedly grab for him as they, too, are entranced. The SIREN has her arm outstretched and PIRATE 3 reaches for her hand. Still held back by AMY, RORY reaches for her. As soon as PIRATE 3's hand touches the SIREN, his body is dispersed. RORY breaks free of AMY.\nRORY: I have to touch her. Let me touch her.\nAMY pushes her way past RORY and faces the SIREN.\nAMY: Sorry, but he is spoken for.\nThe SIREN hisses and turns red. She sends AMY flying backwards to land on the deck.\nDOCTOR: (goes to AMY) Amy! Everybody into the hold.\nThe pirates head to the hold. RORY stands there, still entranced.\nDOCTOR: Rory!\nThe DOCTOR makes sure AMY is safe before grabbing RORY.\nRORY: Hey!\nINT. SHIP, HOLD, NIGHT\nThey make their way down into the hold, splashing through the gathered water.\nAMY: What is that thing?\nAVERY: The legend. The siren. Many a merchant ship, laden with treasure has fallen prey to her. She's been hunting us ever since we were becalmed. Picking off the injured.\nPIRATE 1: Like a shark. A shark can smell blood.\nDOCTOR: OK. Just like a shark. In a dress. And singing. And green. A green singing shark in an evening gown.\nAVERY: The ship is cursed.\nDOCTOR: Yeah right. 'Cursed' is big with humans. Means bad things are happening but you can't be bothered to find an explanation.\nRORY: She's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.\nAMY: Actually I think you'll find she isn't. We have to leave. Right now.\nAVERY: That thing of yours really is a ship?\nDOCTOR: Well, it's not propelled by the wind.\nAVERY: Show me. Weigh anchor. Make it sail! (pulls gun)\nDOCTOR: And the gun's back. You're big on the gun thing aren't you? Freud would say you're compensating. Have you ever met Freud? No? Comfy sofa.\nPIRATE 4: Leave the cursed one, Captain. The creature can have him.\nRORY: Yes, please.\nAVERY: We don't want the siren coming after us.\nThe pirates cry out and one lifts his leg from the water. There's something on it.\nAMY: It's a leech!\nDOCTOR: Everyone out of the water!\nEveryone climbs out of the water onto the crates. PIRATE 4 pulls the leech from his leg.\nPIRATE 4: It's bitten me, I'm bleeding. (the spot appears)\nDOCTOR: She wants blood. Why does she want blood?\nAMY: What were you saying about leaving the cursed ones behind?\nDOCTOR: It's OK. We're safe down here. No 'curse' is getting through three solid inches of timber.\nThe SIREN appears behind the DOCTOR and begins to sing.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Hello again.\nAMY holds back RORY but PIRATE 4 walks forward.\nAVERY & DOCTOR: No! No! No!\nPIRATE 4 touches the SIREN'S hand and disappears. His hat falls to the floor. Everyone rushes from the hold, the DOCTOR pushing RORY, PIRATE 4's hat in hand.\nINT. SHIP, BELOW-DECKS, NIGHT\nThe DOCTOR bolts the door behind him.\nAMY: Safe?\nDOCTOR: I have my good days and my bad days.\nAVERY: How did she get in?\nDOCTOR: (uses sonic on hat) The bilge water - she's using water like a portal, a door. She can materialise through a single drop. We need to go somewhere with no water.\nAMY: Well, thank God we're not in the middle of the ocean.\nThe DOCTOR puts on the hat.\nRORY: Did you see her eyes? Like crystal pools.\nAMY: You are in enough trouble.\nAVERY: The magazine!\nAMY: What?\nDOCTOR: He means the armoury where the powder's stored.\nAVERY: It's dry as a bone.\nDOCTOR: Good let's go, there.\nAVERY: (pulls gun) I give the orders.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Worried because I'm wearing a hat now?! (heads for the magazine) Nobody touch anything sharp!\nAMY: Come on Rory. (pulls him by the arm)\nIn another section below-deck, PIRATE 1 takes out a ring of keys to open a locked door.\nAVERY: Quickly, man.\nPIRATE 1: The key, 'tis gone, Cap'n.\nAVERY: How can it have gone?\nDOCTOR: (pushes the door open) Someone else had the same idea.\nINT. SHIP, MAGAZINE, NIGHT\nThey enter the room cautiously. The room is empty.\nAVERY: Barricade the door. Careful of that lantern! Every barrel is full of powder.\nDOCTOR: Who's been sleeping in my gun room?\nAVERY hears a muffled coughing and removes the lid of one of the barrels. He reaches a hand in a pulls out a young boy.\nAVERY: You fool. You fool, boy. What are you doing here?\nPIRATE 1: Who is he?\nDOCTOR: What, he's not one of the crew?\nAVERY: No. He's my son.\nA few moments later, the BOY is sitting on a bench, AVERY next to him. Everyone else stands and looks on.\nAVERY: What in God's name possessed you, boy? Your mother will be searching for you. (the BOY looks down) When?\nBOY: Last winter. Fever. She told me all about you. How you were a Captain in the Navy. An honourable man, she said. How I would be proud to know you. (coughs) I've come to join your crew.\nAVERY: I don't want you here.\nBOY: You can't send me back. It's too late. We're a hundred miles from home.\nAVERY: It's dangerous here. There's a monster aboard. She leaves a mark on men's skin.\nBOY: The black spot?\nThe BOY shows the palm of his hand. There's a black spot. AVERY grabs his son's hand. The BOY coughs. A little later, AMY, the DOCTOR and RORY are sitting while the pirates stand. RORY rubs the spot on his palm.\nAVERY: There's nothing wrong with the boy. He has no scars.\nDOCTOR: Yep. Ignore my last theory.\nAMY: He has his good days and his bad days.\nDOCTOR: It's not just blood. She's coming for all the sick and wounded. Like a hunter chooses the weakest animal.\nAMY: OK, look He's got a fever.\nDOCTOR: The siren knows it. Humans. second-rate. Damage too easily. It's only a matter of time before everyone gets bruised. My ship. it can sail us all away from here. You and me, we fetch it. Let's go. (stands)\nAVERY: (pulls out pistol) You're not the Captain here, remember?\nThe BOY opens one of the barrels to reveal water. The SIREN reaches through with her arms. The DOCTOR forces the lid back on.\nAVERY: The water's dangerous. That's how she gets through. One touch of her hand and you're a dead man!\nPIRATE 1: We're all cursed if we stay aboard!\nDOCTOR: It's not a curse. Curse means game over. Curse means we're helpless. We are not helpless! Captain, what's our next move?\nAVERY drapes the pendant around the BOY'S neck.\nAVERY: Wait with the boy.\nPIRATE 1: Captain we're all in danger here.\nAVERY: I said wait, and barricade the door after we've gone.\nAMY: Sure you want to go?\nDOCTOR: We have to get Rory and Toby away. She's out there now, licking her lips, boiling a saucepan, grating cheese.\nAMY: OK, well remember, if you get an itch, don't scratch too hard.\nDOCTOR: We've all got to go some time.\nAMY and RORY exchange a look, remembering what they saw in Utah.\nDOCTOR: There are worse ways than having your face snogged off by a dodgy mermaid. (pats RORY on the shoulder)\nINT. SHIP, BELOW-DECKS, NIGHT\nThe DOCTOR and AVERY step out of the room and AVERY puts his gun away.\nAVERY: D'you want to draw lots for who's in charge, then?\nDOCTOR: Darkness. Demon. You can have first go. (pats AVERY on the chest)\nThey make their way back to the hold. AVERY slips and nearly puts his hand down on an exposed nail. The DOCTOR grabs his hand just in time.\nDOCTOR: Nearly. Phew!\nINT. TARDIS\nThe DOCTOR runs up to the console while AVERY stands just inside the door.\nAVERY: By all the... (walks slowly to the console)\nDOCTOR: Let me stop you there. Bigger on the inside. Don't mind, do you, if we just skip to the end of that moment? Oh, and sorry I lied by the way, when I said yours was bigger. Kitchen that way. Choice of bathrooms - there, there, there.\nINT. SHIP, MAGAZINE, NIGHT\nTOBY sits on the floor, coughing. AMY looks at him.\nRORY: What's wrong?\nAMY: The most beautiful thing you've ever seen.\nRORY: Oh, tell me I didn't really say that.\nAMY notices the two pirates removing the barrels blocking the door.\nAMY: What's going on?\nPIRATE 1: We're not staying here to mollycoddle the boy. The Captain's gone soft, it's time for us to leave.\nINT. TARDIS\nThe DOCTOR is typing on the console when AVERY starts pointing and touching controls.\nAVERY: What's this do?\nDOCTOR: (pointing) That does very very complicated. That does sophisticated, that does whoa, amazing, and that does whizz bang far too technical to explain!\nAVERY: Wheel?\nDOCTOR: Atom accelerator.\nAVERY: It steers the thing.\nDOCTOR: No...Sort of...Yes.\nAVERY: Wheel. Telescope. Astrolabe. Compass. A ship's a ship. Oh...\nINT. SHIP, MAGAZINE, NIGHT\nTOBY gets up.\nTOBY: He told you to wait, you dog. He's your Captain, a Naval Officer. You're honour-bound to do as he tells you.\nPIRATE 1: 'Honour-bound'? Do you know what kind of ship this is? Do you know what your father does?\nAMY puts her arms about TOBY'S shoulders.\nAMY: Don't listen to him, Toby.\nPIRATE 1: We sail under the black flag. The Jolly Roger.\nTOBY: Liar!(lunges) He's no wicked pirate!\nPIRATE 1: Oh, you think so? I've seen your father gun down a thousand innocent men.\nINT. TARDIS\nDOCTOR: This is how the professionals do it.\nThe DOCTOR sets the TARDIS in motion. Its machinery groans and goes nowhere.\nDOCTOR: It's stuck. Not responding.\nAVERY: Becalmed?\nDOCTOR: Mm-hm. Apparently. That's new. You had to gloat, didn't you?\nAVERY: I'm not gloating.\nDOCTOR: I saw that look just now. Ha-ha his ship is rubbish.\nAVERY: True.\nINT. SHIP, MAGAZINE, NIGHT\nPIRATE 1: (to PIRATE 5) Get what treasure you can I'll meet you in the row boat.\nTOBY comes forward, a sword pointed at PIRATE 1.\nTOBY: You're going to remain at your post.\nPIRATE 1: I am not playing games with you boy, you put that down.\nTOBY: One more step and I'll use this, you blaggard.\nPIRATE 1: You don't know how to fight with a cutlass, boy.\nTOBY: Don't need to, do I?\nTOBY lunges forward and cuts PIRATE 1 on the hand.\nPIRATE 1: Ah! (breathes heavily) No...\nINT. TARDIS\nThe DOCTOR checks the controls.\nDOCTOR: It can't get a lock on the plane.\nAVERY: The what?\nDOCTOR: The space we travel in. The... ocean. Sort of ocean but not water. The TARDIS can't see. It's sulking because it thinks the space doesn't exist. Without a plane to lock onto we're not going anywhere.\nAVERY: I'm confused.\nDOCTOR: It's a big club. We should get T-shirts.\nThere is an explosion and rumblings.\nDOCTOR: What's happening?\nINT. SHIP, MAGAZINE, NIGHT\nPIRATE 1: (turns his palm over to reveal the spot) You little swabber!\nAMY: Congratulations. Made it to the menu. Probably shouldn't go out there now.\nPIRATE 1: (pulls pistol) You scurvy ape.\nRORY: Don't shoot! The powder will blow and kill us all.\nPIRATE 2 takes the key ring from PIRATE 1's belt.\nPIRATE 1: Mulligan, what are you doing?\nMULLIGAN leaves.\nAMY: No honour among pirates.\nPIRATE 1 lowers his gun and begins to pile the barrels back in front of the door.\nINT. TARDIS\nThe DOCTOR frantically works the controls.\nDOCTOR: OK. She's had her little sulk. Now she's heading for the full-on screaming tantrum.\nAVERY: Can you fix it?\nDOCTOR: The parametric engines are jammed. Orthogonal vector's gone. I'm almost out of ideas.\nAVERY: Almost?\nDOCTOR: Well, we could try stroking her and singing her a song.\nAVERY: Will that help?\nDOCTOR: Hard to say, never has before.\nThe DOCTOR flips a switch in the hopes of regaining control but it doesn't work. The TARDIS rocks.\nDOCTOR: Argh! I've lost control of her, she's about to dematerialise we could end up anywhere!\nAVERY: That sounds bad.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it is! Out! Now! Abandon ship! ABANDON SHIP!\nThe DOCTOR grabs AVERY and pushes him out the door as the console begins to explode, shooting sparks.\nINT. SHIP, BELOW-DECKS, NIGHT\nThe DOCTOR and AVERY run out of the TARDIS and as far from her as possible in the cramped space. They turn around to see the TARDIS enveloped in a green light as it disappears.\nDOCTOR: OK, OK, OK. TARDIS runs off on its own. That's a bit of a new one. Bang goes our only hope of getting them out of here.\nAVERY: Not much of a Captain without a ship, are you?\nThe DOCTOR and AVERY head back to the magazine and are stopped by MULLIGAN who holds two pistols on them. He also carries treasure, a crown around his arm.\nAVERY: Mulligan? What are you doing? This is mutiny.\nMULLIGAN: She doesn't want me. She only wants Toby and the scrawny looking fellow. (runs off)\nDOCTOR: He's got the last of the supplies. We should go after him.\nAVERY: Never mind the damned supplies. What about my treasure?\nAVERY and the DOCTOR follow MULLIGAN. MULLIGAN fires but they take cover.\nDOCTOR: Don't get injured. Don't get injured.\nINT. SHIP, STOREROOM, NIGHT\nThey chase MULLIGAN back to the hold. He locks the door behind him. Using flint, he lights a fire in a small hand-held paddle. drops it when the flames burn his hand.\nAVERY: (through door) Come out of there you mutinous dog!\nMULLIGAN burns his hand and drops the paddle, leaving him in darkness.\nMULLIGAN: Ow!\nINT. SHIP, BELOW-DECKS, NIGHT\nAs the DOCTOR is using the sonic on the lock, they hear the SIREN singing. The DOCTOR and AVERY begin checking each other for injury. The look to the door and see green light through the cracks.\nDOCTOR: She's inside.\nAVERY: She's come for Mulligan.\nMULLIGAN screams. The DOCTOR finally opens the door.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. SHIP, STOREROOM, NIGHT\nThey enter the room and find it empty. The DOCTOR scans the room with the sonic. AVERY grabs the crown.\nAVERY: No water in here. How did she take him? You said she uses water like a door. That's how she enters a room.\nThe DOCTOR looks at the highly-polished crown.\nDOCTOR: I was wrong. Please ignore all my theories up to this point.\nAVERY: What, again!?\nDOCTOR: We're all in danger. The water's not how she's getting in. When we were down in the hold, think what happened. You, me, Amy, Rory, leeches.\nAVERY: She sprang from the water.\nDOCTOR: Yes, only when it grew still! Still water. Nature's mirror.\nAVERY: So... You mean?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Not water... Reflection.\nINT. SHIP, MAGAZINE, NIGHT\nSitting on the floor, TOBY takes the pendant from around his neck and begins to rub it.\nINT. SHIP, STOREROOM, NIGHT\nDOCTOR: The siren legend. The curse.\nAVERY: You said curses weren't real.\nDOCTOR: Folklore springs from truth. She attacks ships filled with treasure. Where else do you get a perfect reflection?\nAVERY: Polished metal.\nDOCTOR: Hmm.\nThe DOCTOR puts the crown away in a bag as AVERY automatically reaches for the pendant. It's not there.\nAVERY: We must warn them.\nINT. SHIP, MAGAZINE, NIGHT\nTOBY is now using a cloth to polish the metal.\nINT. SHIP, BELOW-DECKS, NIGHT\nThe DOCTOR and AVERY hurry back to the magazine. They reach the door.\nDOCTOR: Amy!\nINT. SHIP, MAGAZINE, NIGHT\nDOCTOR: (through door) Open the door!\nAVERY: (through door) Toby open the door!\nAMY and RORY remove the barrels.\nAVERY: (through door) Toby!\nDOCTOR: (through door) Open the door!\nAVERY: (through door) Toby!\nAMY and RORY open the door and the DOCTOR pushes his way through, grabs the pendant from TOBY and begins breathing heavily on it to fog the surface. AMY and RORY just stare at him. He gives a thumbs-up and AVERY relaxes. The DOCTOR then runs out the door.\nINT. SHIP, CAPTAIN'S CABIN, NIGHT\nUsing the butt of a rifle, the DOCTOR begins to smash the small panes of glass that make up the aft window.\nDOCTOR: We've got to destroy every reflection. Gold, silver, glass. She could spring from any of them. (smashes\nmirror) Oh, yes, yes, I know I know. Very bad luck to break it. But look at it this way, there's a stroppy homicidal mermaid trying to kill all.\nAVERY: How much worse can things get?\nDOCTOR: Yep. (looks at treasure) Help me lug this lot out.\nAVERY: Where are we taking it?\nDOCTOR: The ocean.\nAVERY: No. No! This is the treasure of the Mogul of India.\nDOCTOR: Oh, good. For a moment there I thought it was yours.\nAVERY: Doctor, wait. Must we do this?\nDOCTOR: Any reflection, any mirror, and the siren will attack. We have to protect Rory and Toby. Go and get the crown from the storeroom.\nAVERY leaves and the DOCTOR begins to throw the treasure out the broken window.\nINT. SHIP, STOREROOM, NIGHT\nWith a sigh, AVERY takes the crown and leaves.\nEXT. SHIP'S DECK, NIGHT\nA slight breeze moves the dangling shells and charms and the full moon shines down as the SIREN sings.\nINT. SHIP, MAGAZINE, NIGHT\nRORY: Just wait?\nDOCTOR: Not my most dynamic plan, I realise.\nAMY: TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: It's been towed.\nAMY: What?\nDOCTOR: Sorry. We might be stuck here for a while.\nRORY: So you're saying that we should all just wait here below?\nAVERY: The sea is still calm, like a mirror. If you go out on deck she'll rise up and attack you.\nDOCTOR: It's OK. The calm won't last forever. When the wind picks up we'll all set sail.\nAVERY: Until it does, you have to hide down here.\nLATER... AMY and RORY are asleep on the floor. AVERY goes to sit beside TOBY.\nAVERY: I'm sorry about your mother. You miss her a lot.\nTOBY: Three years. No word from you.\nAVERY: Toby...\nTOBY: You promised her. You promised you'd come home. And she believed you would, right up until the day she died. What made you do it? What made you... turn pirate?\nAVERY: Get some sleep now.\nIn her half-sleep state, AMY hears a WOMAN'S voice.\nWOMAN: It's fine. You're doing fine. Just stay calm.\nAMY opens her eyes and sees the same woman with the eye-patch that she saw at the orphanage. The panel slides shut. AMY sits up but the panel has disappeared.\nEXT. SHIP'S DECK, NIGHT\nThe DOCTOR is looking up at the stars when AVERY joins him.\nDOCTOR: It's not one star it's two. (points) The dog star. Sirius. Binary system.\nAVERY: I use it to navigate the ocean.\nDOCTOR: I've travelled far, like you. Space can be very lonely. The greatest adventure is having someone share it with you.\nAVERY: If we get out of this I'll take him back to England. He can't stay with me. I'm not the father he needs.\nDOCTOR: Who are you, Henry Avery? Respected naval officer, wife and child at home. How did you end up here, wandering the oceans with a band of rogues?\nAVERY: I've set my course now. Nothing I can do to alter it.\nDOCTOR: People stared at it for centuries and never knew. Things can suddenly change, when you're least expecting.\n(pats AVERY and leaves)\nINT. SHIP, CAPTAIN'S CABIN, NIGHT\nThe DOCTOR is standing quietly in the middle of the room. AMY enters behind him.\nAMY: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Sssh.\nAMY: What can you see?\nDOCTOR: Feels like something's out there, staring straight at me.\nThere is a crash of thunder and the ship rocks.\nDOCTOR: Man the sails! (runs from the room)\nEXT. SHIP'S DECK, NIGHT\nIt's raining hard. AVERY holds the rigging. AMY and RORY rush topside.\nAVERY: To the rigging, you dogs! Let go the sails. Avast ye!\nAMY and RORY head for the ropes holding the mainsail while AVERY works on the foresail. The DOCTOR is at the wheel.\nAVERY: Put the bunt into the slack of the clews.\nAMY: I swear he's making half this stuff up.\nRORY: What we really need is some sort of phrase book.\nAVERY: Toby! Find my coat. My compass is inside it, boy. (TOBY goes below) Heave ho you bilge rats.\nRORY: 'Rats' was all I could hear.\nTOBY comes back with AVERY'S coat and the crown rolls out along the deck. All they can do is watch. TOBY looks at his father, hurt by the proof that he's a pirate. The SIREN reaches through the reflection on the crown and shoots into the air above the ship. She sings and floats down to the deck, her hand reaching out for TOBY.\nAVERY: Don't let her take you!\nEnthralled, TOBY walks closer, his hand out.\nAVERY: No!\nTOBY touches the SIREN and disappears with a scream.\nAVERY: No!\nAMY holds back RORY as he tries to reach the SIREN. The DOCTOR sneaks behind her and throws the crown into the sea. The SIREN disappears.\nAVERY: I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\nDOCTOR: You couldn't give up the gold could you? That's why you turned pirate! Your commission, your wife, your son. Just how much is that treasure worth to you man?\nAt that moment, the main yardarm swing around and knocks RORY into the churning water.\nAMY: Rory! Rory! (runs to the side) I can't see him. Doctor, I'm going in!\nDOCTOR: He's drowning. You go in after him you'll drown too. There's only one thing that can save him now.\nAMY: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: The siren. The siren, she wants him. We have to release her. (heads for the water barrel)\nAMY: Doctor, no.\nThe DOCTOR removes the lid and releases the SIREN.\nDOCTOR: He's drowning. Go find him!\nThe SIREN dives into the water.\nAMY: What did you do?\nDOCTOR: If he stays in there he'll die.\nAMY: She'll destroy him.\nDOCTOR: That thing isn't just some ravenous hunter! It's intelligent. We can reason with it. And maybe, just maybe, they're still alive somewhere. We have to follow.\nAVERY: Are you mad?\nDOCTOR: If we ever want to see them again, we have to let the siren take us. We'll prick our fingers. All agreed?\n(holds out a fist) Yeah?\nAVERY: Aye.\nAMY: Aye.\nDOCTOR: Aye!\nThe DOCTOR pricks their fingers and the black spot appears. The SIREN appears and sings. They each reach out to her. There is a flash of light.\nINT. SPACESHIP, OBSERVATION, NIGHT\nThey wake up on the floor.\nAMY: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: We haven't moved. We're in exactly the same place as before.\nThey look out the window and see the pirate ship.\nAVERY: We're on a ghost ship.\nDOCTOR: No, it's real. Space ship trapped in a temporal rift.\nAMY: How can two ships be in the same place?\nDOCTOR: Not the same. Two planes, two worlds, two cars parked in the same space. There are lots of different universes nested inside each other. Now and again they collide and you can step from one to the other.\nAMY: OK, I think I understand.\nDOCTOR: Good. Cos it's not like that at all. But if that helps.\nAMY: Thanks.\nDOCTOR: All the reflections have suddenly become gateways.\nThe DOCTOR picks up a piece of metal from the floor and throws it through the window. It passes through and lands on the deck\nDOCTOR: Ever look in a mirror and think you're seeing a whole other world? Well, this time it's not an illusion.\nThey hear a low beeping and begin to explore.\nAMY: The signal.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nAMY: The distress call.\nDOCTOR: Uh-huh.\nThey climb the stairs that lead to the rest of the ship.\nAMY: There was a second ship here all the time.\nThey hear the SIREN.\nDOCTOR: And the siren is on board.\nThe DOCTOR unlocks the door and it slides open to reveal the desiccated body of pteradon-like alien. AVERY pulls out his gun but the DOCTOR pushes it away.\nDOCTOR: Dead.\nThe DOCTOR walks past it followed by AMY and AVERY.\nINT. SPACESHIP, BRIDGE, NIGHT\nOn the bridge, they see another alien still at the controls. The DOCTOR walks up to it. The view from the observation window was that of AVERY'S cabin.\nAMY: You were right, there was something staring at us the whole time. How long has this ship been marooned here?\nAVERY: Long enough for the Captain to have run out of grog.\nAMY: I don't understand. If this is the captain, then what's the siren?\nDOCTOR: Same as us. A stowaway. (uses the sonic to scan the body)\nAMY: She killed it?\nDOCTOR: (checks readings) Human bacteria.\nAMY: What?\nDOCTOR: A virus, from our planet. Airborne, travelling through the portal. (puts away sonic) That's what killed it. (leans on panel) Didn't get its jabs. (lifts his hand to show it covered in slime) Urghhh! Look.\nAMY: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Sneeze! Alien bogies.\nThe DOCTOR shakes his hand, trying to get the slime off. He wipes it on AMY's coat as he walks past and out the room.\nINT. SPACESHIP, SICKBAY, NIGHT\nThey enter the room and the DOCTOR immediately begins to scan with the sonic. Suspended from the ceiling are beds on which people are lying unconscious. They have breathing tubes attached to their throats.\nAVERY: McGrath! He's one of my men.\nAMY: He's still breathing.\nThe DOCTOR finds what looks like rectangular \"discs\" holding information.\nAVERY: My entire crew is here. Toby! (runs to his son)\nAMY: Rory! (runs to her husband)\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS! (runs to the TARDIS and practically hugs it)\nAVERY: We have to get them out of here.\nDOCTOR: Wait! (scans) His fever's gone. (goes to RORY)\nAMY: He looks so well.\nDOCTOR: She's keeping him alive. His brain is still active but all its cellular activity is suspended. (turns over RORY'S palm to show the spot) It's not a curse. It's a tissue sample. (shows one of the \"discs\") Why get samples of people you are about to kill?\nAMY: Help me get him up.\nThe DOCTOR reaches around to undo the tube. An alarm sounds and the SIREN sings.\nDOCTOR: She's coming.\nThe three of them hide. The SIREN arrives and approaches RORY who is now awake. He tries to jerk away from her but calms down as she continues to sing.\nDOCTOR: Anaesthetic.\nAVERY: What?\nDOCTOR: The music. The song. So she anaesthetises people and then puts their bodies in stasis.\nThe SIREN moves to TOBY, her hand resting just above him. AVERY steps out from hiding, gun out.\nDOCTOR: (whispers) Avery. (shouts) No!\nAVERY fires at the SIREN. She turns on him, red and angry. She hisses and advances on AVERY. The DOCTOR runs to another part of the room to drawn her attention. The DOCTOR sneezes and the SIREN stops advancing on AVERY and turns to the DOCTOR, fire between her hands.\nDOCTOR: Whoa. Fire! That's new. What does fire do? Burn? Yes. Destroy? What else? Sterilise! I sneezed. I've brought germs in.\nThe DOCTOR pulls out a handkerchief and blows his nose then throws the cloth to the floor. The SIREN shoots flames at the handkerchief, destroying it. With the distraction, AMY goes to RORY. The SIREN moves slowly towards AMY.\nDOCTOR: Amy stop. Don't interfere. Don't touch him. Anaesthetic, tissue sample, screen, sterile working conditions. Ignore all my previous theories!\nAMY: Yeah, well we stopped paying attention a while back.\nDOCTOR: She's not a killer at all. She's a doctor!\nAMY steps back from RORY'S bed and the SIREN resumes her green glow.\nDOCTOR: This is an automated sick bay. It's teleporting everyone on board. The crew are dead and so the sick bay has had nothing to do. It's been looking after humanity whilst it's been idle. Look at her. A virtual doctor! Able to sterilise a whole room.\nAMY: Able to burn your face off.\nDOCTOR: She's just an interface. Seeped through the join between the planes. Broadcast in our world. Protean circuitry means she can change her form And become a human doctor for humans. Oh, sister you are good!\nAMY reaches for RORY again and the SIREN turns red and hisses until AMY backs away. AVERY stands by TOBY.\nAVERY: She won't let us take them.\nDOCTOR: She's keeping them alive but she doesn't know how to heal them.\nAMY: I'm his wife for God's sake! Why can't I touch him?\nDOCTOR: Tell her Amy. Show her your ring. (grabs AMY'S left hand) She may be virtual but she's intelligent. You can't do anything without her consent. Come on! Sophisticated girl like you, that must be somewhere in your core program.\nAMY: Look He's very ill! OK, I just want to look after him. Why won't you let me near my husband!?\nThe SIREN holds out her left hand and a ring of light appears around it.\nDOCTOR: Consent form. Sign it. Put your hand in the light. Rory's sick. You have to take full responsibility.\nAMY puts her hand through the ring and the SIREN disappears. AMY and the DOCTOR rush to free RORY. AMY turns\noff the power and RORY jerks and gasps.\nDOCTOR: He can't breathe, turn it back on.\nAMY: (turns it back on) What do we do? I can't just leave him here.\nAVERY: He'll die if you take him out.\nAMY strokes RORY'S face.\nAMY: Rory? Wake up.\nRORY: Where am I?\nDOCTOR: You're in a hospital. If you leave you might die.\nAMY: But if you don't you'll have to stay forever.\nRORY: You're saying that if I don't get up now...\nAMY: You can never leave.\nDOCTOR: The siren will keep you safe.\nRORY: And if I come with you?\nDOCTOR: Drowning, on the point of death.\nRORY: I'm a nurse.\nAMY: What?\nRORY: I can teach you how to save me.\nAMY: Hold on.\nRORY: I was drowning. You just have to resuscitate me.\nAMY: Just?\nRORY: You've seen them do it loads of times in films. CPR. The kiss of life.\nAMY: Rory, this isn't a film, ok. What if I do it wrong?\nRORY: You won't.\nAMY: OK, what if you don't come back to life? What if...?\nRORY: I trust you.\nAMY: What about him? I mean why do I have to be the one? Why do I have to save you?\nRORY: Because I know you'll never give up.\nAMY nods. The DOCTOR walks over to AVERY.\nDOCTOR: We have to send this ship back into space. Imagine if the siren got ashore. She would have to process every injured human.\nAVERY: What about Toby?\nDOCTOR: I'm sorry. Typhoid fever. Once he returns it's only a matter of time.\nAVERY: What if I stay with him? Here. The siren will look after him. I can't go back to England. And what home does he have now, if not with me?\nDOCTOR: Do you think you can sail this thing?\nAVERY: Just point me to the atom accelerator.\nThe DOCTOR smiles and pats AVERY on the back before going back to AMY and RORY.\nRORY: I know you can do this. Of course if you muck it up I am going to be really cross. And dead.\nAMY: I'll see you in a minute.\nAMY looks at the DOCTOR who nods and the two of them hurry to unhook RORY from the life support. He gasps for air. Together, the DOCTOR and AMY carry him to the TARDIS.\nINT. TARDIS\nThey set RORY on the floor just inside the door and AMY starts CPR.\nDOCTOR: Come on, come on Rory. Not here. Not this way. Not today.\nAMY: He trusted me he trusted me to save him.\nDOCTOR: You still can. You can still do this. He believes in you. Come on, Amy. Come on!\nAMY presses harder on the compressions.\nAMY: Please, please, please wake up, wake up, wake up.\nAMY sobs and she and the DOCTOR sit back from RORY'S prone body. The DOCTOR reaches a comforting hand over to rest on her back. RORY starts to sputter and cough up water. The DOCTOR stands and looks down at the couple in amazement.\nRORY: Amy. Amy, you did it, you did it! (hugs her as she sobs)\nINT. SPACESHIP, BRIDGE, NIGHT\nAVERY and TOBY sit at the controls. TOBY still has the medical tube attached. Father and son smile at each other and the other five pirates walk in behind them. They head into space, steering by Sirius.\nINT. TARDIS\nAMY and RORY head up the stairs from the console.\nAMY: I thought I was an excellent pirate.\nRORY: I thought you were an excellent nurse.\nAMY: Easy tiger. (turns to look at the DOCTOR) Goodnight, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Goodnight, Amelia.\nAMY: You only call me Amelia when you're worrying about me.\nDOCTOR: I always worry about you.\nAMY flashes on the DOCTOR's death.\nAMY: Mutual.\nDOCTOR: Go to bed, Pond.\nRORY: (whispers) You can't tell him. It's his future.\nThey look at the DOCTOR as he fiddles with the monitor.\nAMY: I know.\nThe couple goes upstairs. The DOCTOR looks at the monitor. The TARDIS is still confused over AMY'S pregnancy scan.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Amelia.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The text is a story about a group of pirates who are stranded on a ship in the middle of the ocean. The ship is damaged and the pirates are running out of supplies. The pirates decide to send a message to the Doctor, who is a time traveler, to ask for help. The Doctor arrives in the form of a TARDIS, a time machine that looks like a police box. The pirates are surprised to see the Doctor and they ask for his help. The Doctor agrees to help them and he and the pirates work together to repair the ship and get it back into space. The pirates are grateful for the Doctor's help and they decide to name the ship after him.

Summer and Marissa come out wearing their sweatshirts for the bonfire)\nSummer: hey (Julie and Neil look) guys we're going to the party (waves)\nMarissa: (waves) bye mom, bye Dr. Roberts\n(Julie watches a much happier Marissa leave with Summer, she looks relieved)\nNeil: what did I tell you\n(Julie looks at Neil)\nCUT TO: The sweatshirt party - we see some coloured light lantern things on string and there are some torches stuck in the sand. there are kids everywhere and of course the bonfire, we see flashes of a few different college sweatshirts, it goes CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, TEXAS A&M, USC and BOSTON COLLEGE. then we see Seung Ho and Taylor standing together, Taylor has SORB ONNE on hers and Seung Ho has STANFORD on his. we then see Ryan and Sadie walk up to Summer and Marissa\nRyan: hey\nMarissa: hey\nSummer: hey guys\nRyan: (to Marissa, nods) congratulations\nMarissa: yeah you too, hi Sadie\nSadie: hey (smiles)\nSummer: um has anyone seen Cohen (frowns)\nRyan: uhh\n(Seth walks up, he's wearing a jacket and not a Brown sweatshirt, for reasons known to no one but Ryan)\nSeth: did someone say my name\nSummer: hey (Seth looks at her) (frowns) your not wearing your sweatshirt\nSeth: uhhh\n(Taylor comes over)\nTaylor: (excitedly) you guys are all here, the core four (smiles, touches Ryans back) I need a picture (Ryan looks at Seth) go, go\nSummer: do you wanna (points)\nTaylor: (to Sadie) sorry, do you mind\nSadie: no, no it's fine\n(Marissa puts her arm around Summers shoulder. the order goes Summer, Marissa, Seth and Ryan. I think what Summer was getting at before was if Seth wanted to be next to her for the photo, and he obviously didn't, aww)\nTaylor: everybody say higher earning potential\nSeth: ah-huh\n(we see the flash of the camera and then we see the photo still on the screen. its such a nice photo! interestingly they all have their hands in their pockets, even more interestingly Seth and Summer have theirs in their jacket pockets while both Marissa and Ryan have theirs in their pants pockets)\nTaylor: (giggles) it's so cute\nSeth: alright\n(Sadie looks around uncomfortably)\nSeth: (to Summer) can I talk to you for a minute\nSummer: yeah\n(Summer looks at Marissa as she walks away, Marissa looks at her)\nSadie: (to Ryan) I'm actually kinda hungry d'you want anything\nRyan: no no I'm\nTaylor: (grabs Sadie's arm) I will show you where the food is\n(Sadie looks at Ryan helplessly as Taylor drags her away)\nTaylor: hi I'm Taylor (Sadie looks back) I use'ta be like total enemies with those guys (proudly) but I'm pretty much second circle core now\n(Ryan and Marissa are standing together, Marissa looks at Ryan, Ryan looks at her)\nRyan: I like your sweatshirt\nMarissa: thanks yours isn't so bad either\n(Ryan looks at Marissa then looks down, Marissa does the same and then she looks off to the side)\nRyan: ...you uh you doin ok\n(Marissa looks at Ryan, a little suprised. Ryan looks at her)\nMarissa: (scoffs, pulls on her sweatshirt) well besides this thing choking me (Ryan looks at her) no you know honestly I'm beginning to think all of this is a bad idea (looks at Ryan)\nRyan: what's that\nMarissa: the sweatshirt (shrugs) party\nRyan: (nods) you know even though we're not together I'm (Marissa looks at him) I'm here if you ever wanna talk\nMarissa: thanks (Ryan looks at her, she looks at him) it means alot\n(Ryan nods and then walks away. Marissa looks cold. we see some more of the other kids, there are 2 guys wearing YALE sweatshirts standing together. Marissa looks around and shrugs, she's by herself still. then we see Taylor, Sadie and Seung Ho standing together)\nTaylor: so this is my friend Seung Ho (Seung Ho smiles) an this is Sadie uh\n(Taylor speaks Korean to Seung Ho, I can make out the word Ryan, I assume she's saying Sadie is Ryan's girlfriend. Seung Ho nods and Sadie looks over at Ryan who is talking with 2 guys. Sadie looks as though she's starting to realise what it's going to be like at Berkeley)\nCUT TO: NB Yacht club - Henry is sitting at the bar by himself and Sandy walks over\nSandy: coulda told me your answer on the phone\nHenry: (looks) well I wanted us to talk\nSandy: so your not pulling out, fine, my friends at the DA's office are gonna find whoever attacked Matt an I can promise you there not gonna keep it quiet\nHenry: look I had nothing to do with what happened to Matt, unfortunately I can't offer you anything but my word\nSandy: (shakes head) which doesn't carry alotta weight with me\nHenry: how bout seven hundred million dollars\nSandy: excuse me\nHenry: with the hospital going up, the cities interested in revitalising the entire area (Sandy listens) parks, affordable housing, restaurants, head of the appropriations committee is a friend of mine, he's asked about your firm\nSandy: wow (moves closer) so now your tryin'a bribe me\nHenry: the face'a this cities changing Sandy, you can be apart of that\n(Sandy looks as though he's thinking)\nCUT TO: Cohen house - we hear a doorbell and see Matt standing at the front door, Kirsten opens it\nKirsten: (shocked) oh my god, what- come inside\nMatt: no it's alright, Sandy here\nKirsten: no no he's out, w- what happened to you\nMatt: some guys broke inta my apartment, listen tell him I stopped by with a proposal\nKirsten: no no Matt wait wait wait (Matt stops) did you call the police (Matt looks at her) they have'ta find out who did this\nMatt: I know who did it (starts to leave)\nKirsten: what're you talking about\nMatt: (looks at Kirsten) look, I really like Sandy but you just gotta, you gotta get him to quit this (Kirsten looks at him shocked) cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late\n(Matt leaves and Kirsten looks stunned)\nCUT TO: The sweatshirt party - Seth is sitting on a chair looking down at the sand and Summer is crouched down next to him\nSummer: so are you gonna talk or what\nSeth: yeah...it's just (Summer looks at him) not easy\nSummer: ...then ill go (Seth looks at her) look I get that your a guy ok an I know you have that whole simian brain thing but (frowns) if we're gonna go to college together next year you cant (Seth looks down) keep freaking out on me all the time\nSeth: yeah (looks up but not at Summer) Summer that's just it\nSummer: what is\nSeth: ...I'm not sure that I wanna (looks at Summer) go to Brown next year\nSummer: (looks at Seth) what\nSeth: I've just been thinkin alot about it an I'm not-I'm not exactly sure that Brown is the right choice for me (looks at Summer) for you (raises eyebrows) I still I think it's great\nSummer: (confused) but we applied to Brown so that we could be together\nSeth: yeah I know (looks down) I just I guess I changed my mind\nSummer: so what we just suddenly apply somewhere else\nSeth: no I think you should still go to Brown (looks at Summer) (Summer looks at him) you should (shrugs) ill just go somewhere else\nSummer: ...do you really mean this\n(Seth looks down, Summer looks at him)\nSeth: ...I'm sorry (shrugs, looks at Summer) I think it's for the best\n(Summer looks away, hurt. Seth looks at her sadly)\nSummer: ...(nods) ok, well I guess um if this is how you feel (raises eyebrows) fine (Seth looks at her) (matter of factly) we're over\n(Summer quickly walks away upset, Seth puts his head down. we now see Sadie sitting on the bottom of the ramp of the lifeguard tower, Ryan walks over)\nRyan: hey, been lookin for ya\nSadie: yeah Taylor went off with that food guy, I'm pretty sure they were talkin dirty to each other in Korean\nRyan: you wanna leave, I know it's kinda hard on you, not knowin anyone\nSadie: (sighs) you're a nice guy Ryan...but I'm not coming to Berkeley with you\n(Ryan sits down next to Sadie and looks at her, then away)\nSadie: don't you see this is what it'll be like next year (sighs, looks at Ryan) you'll have this other world an ill constantly be pulling you away from it, you wont get (Ryan looks at her) to experience college the way you should, I'm not gonna do that to you\nRyan: come on (looks at Sadie)\nSadie: you know I'm right\n(Ryan looks at her, Sadie looks down, Ryan looks away)\nSadie: ...I'm gonna go home (stands) (Ryan stands) I have'ta start packing in the morning\nRyan: ill drive you\nSadie: I wanna walk (Ryan looks at her) an id rather say goodbye here\n(Ryan looks at Sadie helplessly, Sadie leans forward and kisses Ryan)\nSadie: keep in touch Ryan (smiles) I'm gonna miss you\n(Ryan and Sadie look at each other and then Sadie walks away. Ryan watches the back of her as she walks down the beach, gradually getting further away)\nCUT TO: Cohen house - Sandy comes in the front door and Kirsten is waiting for him in the living room with the light off\nKirsten: Sandy\n(Sandy looks over at Kirsten, Kirsten closes her eyes)\nSandy: what're you doin sittin in the dark\nKirsten: Matt came by\nSandy: well what'did he say because you know-\nKirsten: just promise me that your gonna quit this thing\nSandy: oh honey (shakes head) it's complicated\nKirsten: no its not\nSandy: well it's about more than just the hospital\nKirsten: (goes over to Sandy) do you forget that I worked at that company for fifteen years an I saw what happened to my father\nSandy: (shakes head) I'm not gonna become your father, but I can't just quit\n(Kirsten looks at Sandy helplessly, Sandy looks at her. Kirsten walks passed Sandy and over to the door, Sandy watches as she grabs the car keys and leaves)\nCUT TO: Summers bedroom - Summer pulls down her collage of her and Seth and looks at it through tears, she rips it in half and then tears it into smaller pieces. she drops the pieces to the floor as she becomes more upset, aww. we see the pieces lying on the floor and then we see Summer put her hands on the back of her neck and look down sadly, we then see Marissa putting her Berkeley sweater away in her room. she puts it in her top drawer and closes it. she turns around and leans against the drawer and then looks over at Summer's half open door, she heads into Summers room and sees that Summer is curled up on her bed in tears. Summer looks over at Marissa and then away again. Marissa lies down next to Summer and after a few seconds she puts her hand on Summers shoulder. Summer becomes more upset, aww\nCUT TO: Cohen's backyard - we see Seth walking up to the pool house, he walks in and we see Ryan sitting on the edge of his bed looking upset, he has bare feet. Ryan looks over at Seth. Seth stands there next to the bed and then he sits down on the floor, they both lay down at the same time. Ryan onto the bed and Seth onto the floor next to the bed. Ryan spreads his arms out a little and Seth spreads his legs and arms. they both look lost, poor guys - Fade out\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

        "prompt_0": "Buffy is napping in Angel's bed. Angel is watching her sleep. He smiles at her as she wakes.\nBuffy: (smiles) What? Do I have funny bed hair or something?\nAngel: Or something?\nBuffy: I guess we got a little carried away with the whole post-slayage nap thing. (feels her hair) Ohhh, not good. (sits up)\nAngel: Where you going?\nBuffy: To go kill a cat on my head.\nAngel: No mirrors.\nBuffy: You know, this place really isn't girl-friendly. No mirrors, no natural light.\nAngel: I think you look perfect.\nBuffy: Oh yeah, I really like... Okay! (lays down) Maybe we should think about getting a few mirrors. And maybe a drawer, you know, for some of my stuff. Because that's what couples do, they have drawers.\nAngel: Mmmm, that's right.\nBuffy: You know, I-I figure, that way sometimes I could spend the night. Like, after the prom, it would be nice to be able to just come back here and spend some time together.\nAngel: The prom?\nBuffy: End of high school rite of passage thingy. Think cotillion with spiked punch and electric slide.\nAngel: Right.\nBuffy: Oh, don't worry, it's at night. And lots of girls have older girlfriends. You'll blend.\nAngel: I think maybe you should go, hunh?\nBuffy: Noo.. must be a few more hours before sunrise. Buffy gets up and walks to the window. When she pulls back the blackout curtain, it lets in a blast of sunlight directly onto the bed. With an exclamation, Angel rolls out of bed away from the light, apparently unharmed. Buffy pulls the curtains closed suddenly.\nBuffy: Ooh, sorry. I guess it's later than we thought. Angel has a worried look. Opening credits.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDaylight outside Sunnydale High. Xander is walking slowly when Anyanka intercepts him and walks beside him.\nAnya: Xander!\nXander: Well, hey, it's demon Anya, punisher of evil males. Still haven't got your powers back? (serious) You haven't right?\nAnya: No. I will, though. It's just a matter of time.\nXander: So now, how did that work? Women would wish horrible things upon their ex-boyfriends. You'd show up and make it happen.\nAnya: That's right. The power of the Wish made me a righteous sword to smite the unfaithful.\nXander: Well, hey! Good luck with that. Hope it works out for you.\nAnya: You know, you can laugh, but I have witnessed a millenium of treachery and oppression from the males of the species and I have nothing but contempt for the whole libidinous lot of them.\nXander: Then why you talking to me?\nAnya: (averts her eyes) I don't have a date for the prom.\nXander: Well gosh. I wonder why not. It couldn't possibly have anything to do with your sales pitch?\nAnya: Men are evil. Will you go with me?\nXander: One of us is very confused, and I honestly don't know which.\nAnya: You know, this happens to be all your fault.\nXander: My fault?\nAnya: You were unfaithful to Cordelia so I took on the guise of a twelfth-grader to tempt her with the Wish. When I lost my powers I got stuck in this persona, and now I have all these feelings. I don't understand it. I don't like it. All I know is I really want to go to this dance and I want someone to go with me.\nXander: Be still my heart. Oh wait, it is. How come I got the short straw?\nAnya: You're not quite as obnoxious as most of the alpha males around here. Plus I know you don't have a date. <!-- implying Xander is an alpha male? -->\nXander: I haven't settled on anyone yet.\nAnya: Fine. Look, I know you find me attractive. I've seen you looking at my breasts.\nXander: Nothing personal, but when a guy does that, it just means his eyes are open.\nAnya: Whatever. Look, do you wanna go with me or not? Silence.\nCut to a picnic table outside the school, still daylight. Oz, Willow, Buffy, and Xander.\nOz: Anya, huh? Interesting choice.\nXander: Choice is kind of a broad term for my situation. See, it's either Anya or the sock puppet of love for this boy. (holds his right hand in puppet shape, speaks in silly voice) I love you, Xander. I'll never leave you.\nWillow: Well, if Anya tries to get you killed, put me down for a big 'I told you so.'\nXander: (puppet) Who's this Anya? Is she prettier than me?\nWillow: She just better not try to cross me. That's all I'm saying.\nBuffy: Well, at least we all have someone to go with now. Some of us are going with demons, but I think that's a valid lifestyle choice. More importantly, I have the kick dress.\nWillow: Ooh, the pink one?\nBuffy: Angel's gonna lose it. But not his soul. He's gonna lose it. His it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn Angel's mansion. He picks up one of Buffy's notebooks and sees a doodle, \"Angel & Buffy 4 Ever!\" There is a knock at the door. He opens it, careful to avoid the sunlight, and lets Joyce inside.\nAngel: Mrs. Summers.\nJoyce: I'm sorry to, uh... Well, I would have called, but, you know.\nAngel: Please, you're always welcome.\nJoyce: My goodness, your place is amazing.\nAngel: Yeah, I like a lot of space. I don't get out much during the day.\nJoyce: No, you wouldn't. (Her gaze pauses on a set of manacles that are fastened to a wall.)\nAngel: Can I get you something? I don't have any coffee.\nJoyce: Oh, no thank you, I, uh... You don't drink? Beverages, I mean?\nAngel: No, I do. It's just the caffeine. It makes me jittery.\nJoyce: Oh. I understand Buffy spent the night.\nAngel: I'm sorry about that. We came back after patrol.\nJoyce: I, I'm not interested in the details. That's not why I'm here.\nAngel: Okay.\nJoyce: I'm here because I'm worried about you two. In general.\nAngel: What happened before, when I changed, it won't happen again.\nJoyce: That's not all I'm concerned about. I don't have to tell you that you and Buffy are from different worlds.\nAngel: No, you don't.\nJoyce: She's had to deal with a lot. Grew up fast. Sometimes even I forget that she's still just a girl.\nAngel: I'm old enough to be her ancestor.\nJoyce: She's just starting out in life.\nAngel: I know. I think about it more now that she's staying in Sunnydale.\nJoyce: Good. Because when it comes to you, Angel, she's just like any other young woman in love. You're all she can see of tomorrow. But I think we both know that there are some hard choices ahead. If she can't make them, you're gonna have to. I know you care about her. I just hope you care enough.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the library. Willow, Oz, Buffy, and Xander.\nBuffy: So it was blue and sorta short.\nWillow: Not too shore, medium. And it had this weird, sorta fringey stuff on its arms.\nGiles: (walking in) What's that, a demon?\nBuffy: A prom dress that Will was thinking of getting. Can't you ever get your mind out of the hellmouth?\nGiles: I'd be delighted to. However, the day of the Mayor's Ascension is fast approaching and we don't know what to expect.\nXander: Well, what about the pages that Will stole from the Mayor's book? Look, she put her life on the line there, pal. Don't tell me they're useless.\nGiles: On the contrary, no, we, uh, we know the Ascension refers to a human transforming into a demon, the living embodiment of an immortal. And Graduation Day, our Mayor Wilkins is scheduled to do just that. Wesley enters, followed closely by Cordelia.\nWesley: (enters) Trouble is, we don't know which demon he is going to become.\nGiles: There are thousands of species.\nWesley: So, it's safe to say we shouldn't waste any time of such trifling matters as a school dance.\nCordelia: Well, that's too bad, because I bet you would look way 007 in a tux.\nWesley: Except, of course, on the actual night, I will be aiding Mr. Giles in his chaperoning duties.\nGiles: What? Excuse me? Fine, fine, fine.\nBuffy: (to Willow) We'll get you a dress. You know, we should check April Fools.\nCordelia: Don't go there! I shop there.\nXander: I myself am dipping into my road trip fund to procure a shiny new tux, so look for me to dazzle.\nGiles: And I myself will be wearing pink taffeta as chenille would not go with my complexion. Can we *please* talk about the Ascension?\nBuffy: Giles, we get it. Miles to go before we sleep. But especially if we're all gonna vaporize or something on Graduation Day, we deserve a little prommy fun. One night of glory, not to much to ask.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDaylight. Exterior shot of a dingy suburban house. Inside. A hand loads a videotape into a VCR. Pan to a snarling creature, roughly humanoid, in a wire cage. The creatures struggles are warping the cage sides. One corner has already come loose.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDaylight. Exterior shot of a cathedral. Inside. Angel and Buffy in wedding clothes stand at an altar before a priest.\nPriest: Into this holy estate, these two persons present now come to be joined. If any man can show just cause why they should not be lawfully joined together, let him speak now, or else, hereinafter, hold his peace. The priest's voice fades under the swelling music. The camera pans around the couple until it looks from the priest's viewpoint. Behind them, the chapel is empty. The doors at the back are open, and the sunlight is bright against the interior darkness. They exchange rings. They kiss. They walk to the exterior doors, hand in hand. The music turns darker. Buffy looks very happy, but Angel looks apprehensive. As they leave the church, they separate and stand a few feet apart at the top of the steps. Angel squints up at the sky, but does not burst into flame.\nBuffy: Angel? A flame appears on Buffy's exposed skin and rapidly engulfs her. Angel looks on in shock. Buffy burning body crumbles to ashes. Angel wakes up from the nightmare.\nFade to commercial.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn a sewer tunnel. Buffy and Angel enter through a manhole in the roof of the tunnel and start walking.\nBuffy: I always say patrol's not complete without a trip to the stinky sewers.\nAngel: I'm sure I saw him come down here.\nBuffy: Couldn't we just let this be the vamp that got away? We could say he was this big. (Holds hands apart, like a fish story.)\nAngel: What can I say? I need closure.\nBuffy: You need clothes. You don't have a tux, do you?\nAngel: Since when did patrolling go black tie?\nBuffy: For the prom, silly.\nAngel: We have more important things to think about right now than a dance, Buffy.\nBuffy: Sorry, Giles. I'll just be quiet.\nAngel: Come on, don't be that way. A vampire drops from the roof, growling.\nBuffy: Not now. Buffy casually stakes the vampire and turns to Angel.\nBuffy: I'm not being that way. Every time I say the word 'prom', you get grouchy.\nAngel: I'm sorry. I'm just worried that you're getting too...invested in this whole thing.\nBuffy: What whole thing? Isn't this the stuff that I'm supposed to get invested in? Going to a formal, graduating, growing up.\nAngel: I know.\nBuffy: Then what? What's with the dire?\nAngel: It's uh, it's nothing.\nBuffy: No, you have 'something' face.\nAngel: I think we need to talk, but not now and not here.\nBuffy: No. No, if you have something to say, then say it. (silence) Angel, drop the cryptic. You're scaring me.\nAngel: I've been thinking... about our future. And the more I do, the more I feel like us, you and me being together, is unfair to you.\nBuffy: Is this about what the Mayor said? Because he was just trying to shake us up.\nAngel: He was right.\nBuffy: No. No, he wasn't. He's the bad guy.\nAngel: You deserve more. You deserve something outside of demons and darkness. You should be with someone who can take you into the light. Someone who can make love to you.\nBuffy: I don't care about that.\nAngel: You will. And children.\nBuffy: Children? Can you say jumping the gun? I kill my goldfish.\nAngel: Today. But you have no idea how fast it goes, Buffy. Before you know it, you'll want it all, a normal life.\nBuffy: I'll never have a normal life.\nAngel: Right, you'll always be a Slayer. But that's all the more reason why you should have a real relationship instead of this, this freak show. (Buffy is stunned.) I didn't mean that.\nBuffy: I'm gonna go.\nAngel: (grabs her arm) I'm sorry. Buffy, you know how much I love you. It kills me to say this.\nBuffy: Then don't. Who are you to tell me what's right for me? You think I haven't thought about this?\nAngel: Have you, rationally?\nBuffy: No. No, of course not. I'm just some swoony little schoolgirl, right?\nAngel: I'm trying to do what's right here, okay? I'm trying to think with my head instead of my heart.\nBuffy: Heart? You have a heart? It isn't even beating!\nAngel: Don't.\nBuffy: Don't what? Don't love you? I'm sorry. You know what? I didn't know that I got a choice in that. I'm never gonna change. I can't change. I want my life to be with you.\nAngel: I don't.\nBuffy: You don't want to be with me? I can't believe you're breaking up with me.\nAngel: It doesn't mean that I don't ...\nBuffy: How am I supposed to stay away from you?\nAngel: I'm leaving. After the Ascension, after it's finished with the Mayor and Faith. If we survive, I'll go.\nBuffy: Where?\nAngel: I don't know.\nBuffy: Is this really happening?\nFade to a cityscape showing the moon hanging in the night sky. Switch to Buffy, alone and miserable. Switch to Angel staring into his fireplace.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDaylight. Exterior shot of the Summers house. In Buffy's bedroom, Buffy and Willow sit cross-legged on the bed.\nWillow: So, that's it?\nBuffy: That's it. Assuming we survive this Ascension thing, he's gonna leave town.\nWillow: Well, he's a fool. He's just a big, dumb, jerk person if you ask me. And he's a super-maxi-jerk for doing it right before the prom.\nBuffy: It's not his fault. He's 243 years old. He doesn't exactly get the prom.\nWillow: But he should, if ...\nBuffy: Will, it's okay. You don't have to make him the bad guy.\nWillow: But that's the best friend's job, vilifying and grousing.\nBuffy: Usually, yeah. But he's right. I mean, I think, maybe in the long run, that he's right.\nWillow: Yeah, I think he is. I mean, I tried to hope for the best, but... I'm sorry. It must be horrible.\nBuffy: I think horrible is still coming. Right now, it's worse. Right now, I'm just trying to keep from dying. (her face contorts in pain)\nWillow: Oh Buffy. Buffy leans over into Willow's lap and starts sobbing.\nBuffy: I can't breathe, Will. I feel like I can't breathe.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nExterior shot of the dingy house. Inside, the creature in the cage is struggling violently against its chains. The cage sides bend and finally it escapes. It scrambles out of the room.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nApril Fools dress shop. Xander is walking on the sidewalk and sees Cordelia inside. He enters. Cordelia is admiring the same dress he saw in the previous episode (Choices).\nXander: Okay, how long does it take you to buy a damn dress?\nCordelia: Xander! I, uh, I'm considering things a little more carefully nowadays. I don't want to get stuck with another dud.\nXander: Well this should work for you. It positively screams nympho.\nSalesgirl: Is this a customer or a friend?\nXander: Neither. Just stopped by for my daily helping of bile.\nSalesgirl: So you better get back to work and quit goofing. Mrs. Finkel so has it in for you. Quick shot of the supervisor glancing back at Cordelia.\nXander: You work here?\nCordelia: Yes. Yes, I work here.\nXander: But, uh, why?\nCordelia: I'm trying to buy a dress.\nXander: But don't you already have all the dresses?\nCordelia: I have nothing, okay? No dresses. No cell phone. No car. Everything's been taken away because Daddy made a little mistake on his taxes. For the last twelve years. Satisfied? Are you a happy Xander now? I'm broke. I can't go to any of the colleges that accepted me. And I can't stay home because we no longer have one.\nXander: Uh, wow.\nCordelia: Yeah, neato. Now you can run along and tell all of your friends how Cordy finally got hers. How she has to work part time just to get a lousy prom dress on layaway. And how she has to wear a name tag. Oh, I'm a name tag person. Don't leave that out. The story just wouldn't have the same punch. The escaped creature from the dingy house bursts through the front window of the shop. Xander pushes Cordelia out of harm's way and attempts to grapple the creature. It pushes him down and jumps on top of him. Then it sees a man wearing a tux and attacks that man, rending and tearing savagely.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the library. The Scooby Gang (including Wesley) sit around the table watching a surveillance tape of the attack.\nXander: Right there. See, it's, it's like he just realized he forgot to put money in the meter or something.\nCordelia: You know the part that totally weirded me out? That thing had good taste. I mean, he chucks Xander and went right for the formal wear.\nXander: That's right. He left behind his copy of Monsters Wear Daily.\nCordelia: I'm serious. Look at the outfit that Xander's wearing. Now look at the kid that the monster went after. Very smooth lines, 'til he was shredded.\nBuffy: I don't want to see it again. Giles: Buffy, I know it's horrible, but if you're going to hunt this creature, you should study it.\nBuffy: Think I got it.\nWillow: She's right. I mean, you've seen one big hairy bringer of death, you've seen 'em all.\nWesley: If I'm not mistaken, this is a hellhound.\nGiles: Yes. It's particularly vicious. It's sort of a demon foot soldier bred during the Machash Wars. Trained solely to kill. They feed off the brains of their foes.\nCordelia: Look! Right there, zoom in on that.\nXander: It's a videotape.\nCordelia: So? They do it on television all the time.\nXander: Not with a regular VCR they don't.\nWesley: Perhaps we could stay on the topic for once. What were you doing this afternoon?\nCordelia: What? Um, I was...\nXander: Burning a hole in daddy's wallet, as usual. I just bumped into her during my tuxedo hunt.\nOz: What's that? Pause it.\nXander: Guys! It's just a normal VCR. It doesn't... Oh wait, uh, it can do pause. When the picture is paused, a male teen can be seen peering through the shop's broken window.\nXander: Hello, hellhound raiser.\nCut to a closeup of a class yearbook.\nOz: Tucker Wells. He's in my chem lab.\nWesley: Let me guess. He was quiet, kept to himself, but always seemed like a nice young man.\nOz: He didn't seem the murderous type anyway. Something must have happened to him.\nXander: How's it going over there, Buff?\nBuffy: Fine.\nXander: Well, I just wanted to say that your impersonation of an inanimate object is really coming along.\nBuffy: Thanks.\nWillow: Ooooh! I got into Tucker's e-mail account. Listen to this message Tucker sent to this kid David Metz at school last week. The Sunnydale High lemmings have no idea what awaits them. Their big night will be their last night.\nGiles: So, we have a threat against the students on their big night, a hellhound trained to attack people in formal wear...\nCordelia: Oh, are we all catching up now?\nGiles: Tucker is planning to attack the prom tonight.\nOz: Once again, the Hellmouth puts the special in special occasion.\nXander: Why do I even buy tickets for these things, I ask you?\nWillow: Wonder if I can take my dress back?\nBuffy: (wakes up) Don't you dare.\nWillow: But Tucker is going to...\nBuffy: No! You guys are going to have a prom. The kind of prom that everyone should have. I'm going to give you all a nice, fun, normal evening if I have to kill every single person on the face of the earth to do it.\nXander: Yay?\nFade to commercial.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nStill in the library.\nBuffy: Okay, Wes, why don't you go to Tucker's house. He's probably not there, but it's worth a shot.\nWesley: Alright. Perhaps strength in numbers would be ...\nBuffy: You can take Cordy.\nWesley: If that's your plan, alright, alright. What about the others?\nBuffy: Oz, you said you know this David kid that Tucker e-mailed? Why don't you and Will track him down? See what he knows, if he's involved?\nWillow: We're on it.\nBuffy: (to Wesley) And you know what? Could you two check the magic shop?\nWesley: Magic shop?\nBuffy: Yeah. It's right next to the dress store on Main.\nXander: I can swing that one. What's the mission?\nBuffy: See if anyone's been in, buying supplies to raise a hellhound.\nXander: Gotcha. Or check and see who's been stocking up on hellhound snausages. I hear those pups will do anything for a tasty treat.\nBuffy: Giles, you said this thing eats brains. Any brains?\nGiles: Um, I suppose.\nBuffy: Then Tucker must be feeding it, right?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCut to a meat packing plant. Buffy is walking next to hanging carcasses with a guy in a white coat and a hard hat.\nPacker: Yeah, yeah. This kid orders cow brains a couple of times a week. Goes to this address. (hands her a note) Good luck. He's a weird kid.\nBuffy: Thanks. Thanks a lot.\nThe packer walks away. Buffy looks up to see Angel nearby, paying another packer for a plastic bag. He sees her.\nAngel: What are you doing here?\nBuffy: Hello to you too.\nAngel: Sorry. I'm just surprised.\nBuffy: Me too. I don't know why though. Where did I think you get your blood, McPlasma's?\nAngel: How are you?\nBuffy: Right as rain, whatever that means. Don't look at me like that. I can lie to you if I want to now. We're ex, remember?\nAngel: If it means anything, I miss you.\nBuffy: Could we not, please? When I think about us, I have this tendency to sort of go catatonic. And I really can't afford to do that right now. Gotta stop a crazy from pulling a Carrie at the prom.\nAngel: You still planning to go?\nBuffy: Strictly in the chaperon capacity. But it's fine. I mean, the... I'm cool with going stag. I'm over the whole Buffy gets one perfect high school moment thing. But I'm certainly not going to let some subhuman ruin it for the rest of the senior class.\nAngel: Let me help you.\nBuffy: I'm okay.\nAngel: If you ever need my help...\nBuffy: Look, I got it! (pause) Thanks. (leaves)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the dress shop. Cordelia is leaving work.\nSalesgirl: Hey! Don't forget your dress. Aren't you wearing it tonight?\nCordelia: As much as I hate to admit it, I haven't finished paying for it yet.\nSalesgirl: Well somebody did.\nCordelia: What? Who? (looks at the receipt)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBuffy enters the library. Giles is sipping coffee. Xander, Willow, and Oz are sitting on a step and looking glum.\nXander: Zeroes all around, Buff.\nWillow: Sorry.\nBuffy: Make not with the long faces. I got the address. Now the prom starts in a little while. I want you guys to go on and I'll catch up with you as soon as I put a lid on this jerk.\nXander: What? No way.\nWillow: We can't just leave you, Buff.\nGiles: Buffy, they're right. You need...\nBuffy: To see taillights. Hit the door. I have everything under control.\nOz: Buffy, it makes sense to ...\nBuffy: Have. A. Nice. Time. The trio rush off.\nWillow: Okay then.\nXander: See ya.\nBuffy: (to Giles) I want you at the gym. Keep an eye on them until I get there. Buffy marches into the book cage and begins loading up her weapons bag.\nGiles: I don't have to tell you that you're being rather rash. Finding an address hardly adds up to case closed.\nBuffy: Look, it's done. You want to go after them and tell them that they can't go? That all of their planning and dreaming was for nothing? That they can't spend tonight with their honeys of all nights?\nGiles: Angel's not taking you, is he?\nBuffy: Angel's leaving me. He's leaving town.\nGiles: Oh, Buffy, I'm sorry. I don't really know what to say. Um, I understand that this sort of thing requires ice cream of some kind?\nBuffy: Ice cream will come. First, I want to take out psycho boy.\nGiles: You sure?\nBuffy: The great thing about being a Slayer, kicking ass is comfort food.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAt the prom. Flashy lights and dancing. Xander and Anya stroll through the crowd.\nAnya: So she wished her husband's head would explode, which was great except we were standing three feet from him at the time. What a mess. Of course, you know, during the plague it was always parts falling off. Well, that got old since pretty much they were anyway. The Renaissance, that was ... (voice fades as they exit stage right) Giles and Wesley stand by a table munching hors-d'oeuvres.\nWesley: Well, I must say this is all rather odd to me.\nGiles: Oh yes. At an all-male preparatory they didn't go in for this sort of thing.\nWesley: No, of course not. Unless you count the nights you made the lower classmen get up as girls and watched them ... (stops on Giles's look) Dip is tasty, isn't it? Cordelia enters in her new dress. Wesley is struck by a coughing. Giles is not facing the door and looks askance.\nWesley: Sauce is hot. (another lingering shot of Cordy) Very hot. Short montage of prom scenes, dancing, couple photos. Willow and Oz arrive.\nWillow: We got in. Maybe we should dance before we get besieged, bedeviled, or beheaded or something.\nOz: It's not gonna happen.\nWillow: You're not even a little nervous?\nOz: You think Buffy is going to let us down?\nWillow: Want to share some punch? Oz and Willow walk by. Wesley approaches Cordelia.\nWesley: May I say, you look smashing.\nCordelia: It's a start. Cordelia takes Wesley's arm. Pan to Xander and Anya. Xander has a glazed look.\nAnya: So then this one time, this girl wished her ex would cannibalize himself. Even I had a hard time watching that, let me tell you.\nXander: Cordelia! Wesley! My god in heaven, it's good to see you. How are you both? And details, please.\nWesley: Very well, thank you.\nCordelia: Yes, thank you. (emphasis with eyebrows)\nXander: It looks good on you.\nCordelia: Well, duh. Xander gives a subtle smile and nod and the couples part. Giles is chatting with a couple of women at the refreshments, but is keeping an eye on the door, watching for Buffy.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nInside Tucker's house. Buffy sneaks down a staircase and finds Tucker about to release a caged hellhound.\nTucker: You're ready to go.\nBuffy: Sorry, new plan. She throws him away from the cage.\nBuffy: The prom's a go and you're pathetic.\nTucker: Maybe. Maybe not. Tucker breaks a vase over Buffy's head - she brushes the shards off her jacket. He brandishes a screwdriver at her. She sees videotapes on top of the TV with labels like \"Prom Night IV\" and \"Pump Up the Volume\".\nBuffy: So that's how you did it? That's how you brainwashed the hounds to go psycho on prom?\nTucker: Neat, huh?\nBuffy: I don't get it. What kind of sicko wants to destroy the happiest night of a senior's life?\nTucker: I have my reasons. Quick flashback to more innocent Tucker and a girl.\nTucker: Do you want to go to the prom with me?\nGirl: No. Back to Buffy and Tucker.\nBuffy: Whatever. Every maladjust has his reasons. Luckily for me, you're an incompetent maladjust. Buffy disarms him and ties his hands behind him with an electrical cord. She opens a door and starts to push him through it.\nBuffy: Now I'm gonna lock you in here and then I'm gonna party like it's ... In the room are three empty cages before three blank TV sets.\nTucker: Gotta have a redundancy system. Any incompetent knows that. My three fiercest babies are on their way to the dance right now. You think formal wear makes them crazy, wait 'til they see the mirror ball.\nFade to commercial.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNight, outside the prom hall. The three hellhounds lope toward the building doors. Buffy drops the trailing hound with a crossbow bolt. The other two turn and chase her. She runs.\nBuffy: That's right. Follow Buffy. Good dogs. They chase her for a few moments, then hear the party music and reverse course.\nBuffy: Oh, come on. That song sucks. She chases them into the building. Cut to a hallway. The hounds are pawing at closed doors. Buffy approaches and they attack her. She wraps one in a hanging tapestry, then wrestles the other one until she can knife it in the chest. The first one escapes the tapestry just as a male student opens the doors into the hall.\nBuffy: Get back! Buffy grabs the hound before it can attack the student, grapples with it, and finally snaps its neck.\nStudent: (shaken) Bathroom? Buffy points.\nStudent: Th-th-tha...\nBuffy: You're welcome.\nCut to outside. Buffy drags the hellhounds into the bushes, then pulls her prom dress out of her bag.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAt the dance. Buffy enters, Giles sees her, and they exchange nods and smiles. Oz and Willow meet her.\nWillow: Buffy, you look awesome.\nBuffy: So do you.\nOz: Everything cool?\nBuffy: Coolest. Devil dogs are history. How's the prom?\nOz: Strangely affecting. I got all teared up when they played 'We Are Family'.\nWillow: Everything's perfect. Buffy - big smile.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAt the prom. Everyone is standing, watching the stage. Xander is miming anticipation.\nAnnouncer: And the award for Sunnydale High's Class Clown for 1999 goes to Jack Mayhew. The winner puts on a balloon hat and acts silly.\nXander: Please! Anybody can be a prop class clown. You know, none of the people who vote for these things are even funny. Buffy is at the punch bowl, ignoring the ruckus. The announcer urges Jonathan to the microphone.\nJonathan: We have one more award to give out. Is Buffy Summers here tonight? Did she, um... The crowd turns and finds her. She looks nervous at the attention.\nJonathan: This is actually a new category. First time ever. I guess there were a lot of write-in ballots, and, um, the prom committee asked me to read this. \"We're not good friends. Most of us never found the time to get to know you, but that doesn't mean we haven't noticed you. We don't talk about it much, but it's no secret that Sunnydale High isn't really like other high schools. A lot of weird stuff happens here.\"\nCrowd outbursts: Zombies! Hyena people! Snyder! (laughter)\nJonathan: \"But, whenever there was a problem or something creepy happened, you seemed to show up and stop it. Most of the people here have been saved by you, or helped by you at one time or another. We're proud to say that the Class of '99 has the lowest mortality rate of any graduating class in Sunnydale history.\" (applause from the crowd) \"And we know at least part of that is because of you. So the senior class, offers its thanks, and gives you, uh, this.\" Jonathan produces a multicolored, glittering, miniature umbrella with a small metal plaque attached to the shaft.\nJonathan: It's from all of us, and it has written here, \"Buffy Summers, Class Protector.\" The crowd breaks into sustained applause and cheering. Buffy walks to the stage and takes her award. Later, Giles is watching the dancing and Wesley approaches him.\nWesley: Mr. Giles. I'd like your opinion. While the last thing I want to do is muddle bad behavior in front of impressionable youth, I wonder if asking Miss Chase to dance would...\nGiles: For God's sake, man, she's eighteen. And you have the emotional maturity of a blueberry scone. Just have at it, would you, and stop fluttering about. (walks away)\nWesley: Right, then. Thanks for that.\nCut to the dance floor. Wesley and Cordelia begin to dance. Pan to Xander and Anya, dancing close.\nAnya: This isn't bad.\nCut to Buffy, watching the dancers. Giles comes up behind her.\nGiles: You did good work tonight, Buffy.\nBuffy: And I got a little toy surprise.\nGiles: I had no idea that children en masse could be gracious.\nBuffy: Every now and then, people surprise you.\nGiles: (looking past her) Every now and then. Giles takes her umbrella and leaves. Buffy turns to see Angel at the door. They meet.\nBuffy: I never thought you'd come.\nAngel: It's a big night. I didn't want to miss it. It's just tonight. It doesn't mean that I ...\nBuffy: I know. I mean, I understand.\nAngel: Dance with me? They dance.\nBLACK OUT\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Words quite fail me.\nCHANG: You are most generous.\nJAGO: Have I ever, in my thirty years in the halls, seen such a dazzling display of lustrous legerdemain? So many feats of superlative, supernatural skill? The answer must be never, sir. Never.\nSIN: Honourable master is kind to bestow praise on humble Chang's miserable, unworthy head.\nJAGO: Dashed clever, the way you work the little fellow. Wires in the sleeves, I dare say. But I'll not pry, Mister Chang. The secrets of the artistes are sacrosanct.\nBULLER (OOV.): Hey, you!\nJAGO: What the deuce?\nBULLER: Where's my Emma? What have you done with her?\nJAGO: You've got no right to burst in here.\nBULLER: Out of my way! It's him I want.\nCHANG: Your Emma?\nBULLER: She come in here last night and nobody ain't seen her since.\nJAGO: I'll have the fellow ejected.\nBULLER: Now I'm asking you, mister, what's happened to her?\nJAGO: Call the stage hands, Freddy.\nCHANG: It's all right, Mister Jago. Please, come with me.\nJAGO: Courteous coves, these Chinese. I'd have propelled him onto the pavement with a punt up the posterior.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCHANG: Your wife?\nBULLER: Emma Buller. And don't deny she was here, cos I saw her with my own eyes.\nCHANG: Many ladies come to theatre. Why should you think\nBULLER: Not round the side door, they don't. Now, look. I was passing in my cab and I saw her plain, and I know it was you she was calling on. She's been acting queer ever since you put the 'fluence on her last week, so don't try coming the innocent, Mister. I want to know where she is or I'm calling the law. Clear?\nCHANG: Your wife came on stage?\nBULLER: Last week. Levitated her, you did. She's not been the same since. It's done something to her reason, I shouldn't wonder. And she was here last night.\nCHANG: Not to see me.\nBULLER: Don't come the cod. She's disappeared. Nobody's seen her, not since she come here last night, so what about it, eh?\nCHANG: In my country we have saying. Man who goes too quickly may step in bear trap.\nBULLER: Right, I'm getting the Peelers.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLEELA: These clothes are ridiculous. Why must I wear them?\nDOCTOR (OOV.): Because you can't go walking around Victorian London in skins. You'll frighten the horses.\nDOCTOR: Anyway, we don't want to be conspicuous, do we?\nLEELA: A swamp creature. That was it's attack cry.\nDOCTOR: Oh no, it was a ship on the river. Excellent. It means we can't be far away.\nLEELA: From where?\nDOCTOR: From where we're going.\nLEELA: Doctor, you make me wear strange clothes, you tell me nothing. You are trying to annoy me.\nDOCTOR: I'm trying to teach you, Leela. Surely you'd like to see how your ancestors enjoyed themselves? Splendid. That's why I'm taking you to the theatre. Li H'sen Chang. Hmm, pity. I'd rather hoped we'd catch Little Tich. Never mind. If we hurry we'll just catch the second house.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJAGO: You'd better get your tail pinned on. Linens up in five minutes. Casey, have you got the oopizootics coming on?\nCASEY: Mister Jago, I've seen it. I've seen it again!\nJAGO: Be quiet. I told you before.\nCASEY: Horrible, horrible it was, Mister Jago. A great skull coming at me out of the dark.\nJAGO: Damme, you don't want to bankrupt me, Casey. Keep your voice down. Threadbare in Carey Street I'll be if people get the notion there's anything wrong with this theatre.\nCASEY: Chains clanking, nine foot tall.\nJAGO: You've been drinking.\nCASEY: Not a drop, sir.\nJAGO: Well, it's time you started.\nJAGO: Now pull yourself together, man.\nCASEY: I ain't never going down that cellar again. There I was, fixing the trap, when this apparition rose out of the ground in front of me. Hideous, it was. Hideous.\nJAGO: That's enough.\nJAGO: It's your imagination.\nCASEY: Never.\nJAGO: A cat or something must be trapped down there making noises. Tell you what I'll do, Casey. I'll come down with you this evening, as soon as the house is clear, and we'll have a good look round. Now how's that?\nCASEY: It was no cat, Mister Jago. I seen it!\nJAGO: Please, Casey, remember, mum's the word.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLEELA: This is a big village.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nLEELA: What's the name of the tribe here?\nDOCTOR: Cockneys.\nLEELA: The sound of death!\nDOCTOR: You stay here.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me, can I help you?\nQUICK (OOV.): Hold you there.\nQUICK: Now then, what's all this?\nLEELA: Touch me and I'll break your arm.\nQUICK: Now don't be foolish, miss.\nDOCTOR: Good evening.\nLEELA: Keep back, Doctor. Blue guards!\nDOCTOR: Good evening, Constable.\nQUICK: Good evening, sir. You know this young female, sir?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, yes. We were attacked by this little man and four other little men.\nQUICK: When I got here, sir, he was being strangled with his own pigtail, sir.\nDOCTOR: Really? Girlish enthusiasm, officer?\nQUICK: You might call it that, sir. I call it making an affray. I must ask you to come down the station with me.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCHANG: Please to see, ladies and gentlemen, subject now in state of deep hypnosis.\nAUDIENCE: Oh!\nSIN: She asleep.\nCHANG: She not asleep, Mister Sin.\nSIN: She been slugging type of toddy.\nCHANG: I will prove young lady not asleep.\nSIN: She's lying on metal bar.\nCHANG: Not lying on metal bar.\nSIN: I've seen it done before.\nCHANG: I will prove young lady not lying on metal bar.\nSIN: She's held up by wires.\nCHANG: Enough.\nSIN: You can't fool me.\nCHANG: Silence!\nSIN: Don't touch me! Help! Police! Murder!\nCHANG: You see? No wires, Mister Sin. I will now demonstrate art of levitation raising most beautiful lady high above own topknot.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKYLE: Name, sir?\nDOCTOR: Doctor. Leela.\nKYLE: Place of residence, sir?\nLEELA: We've only just arrived here.\nDOCTOR: We're on our way to the theatre, do you see.\nKYLE: Your home address will do for the moment, sir. You do have a permanent address, sir?\nDOCTOR: No, Sergeant. We're travellers.\nKYLE: I see. Persons of no fixed abode.\nDOCTOR: No, no, no, no. We do have an abode. It's called a TARDIS.\nKYLE: A TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: But it's not fixed.\nKYLE: I can give you and the young lady a fixed abode, sir. Quite easily.\nDOCTOR: Flat footed imbecile.\nKYLE: What was that, sir?\nDOCTOR: It was nothing complementary. Get on with it, Sergeant.\nKYLE: Now look, sir. We've got our hands full here, all these girls going missing in the manor, so if you'd just oblige us by answering any questions we'll get on a lot better. And a lot quicker.\nDOCTOR: Sergeant, all this is irrelevant. I've come here to lay evidence.\nKYLE: We'll come to that in good time.\nDOCTOR: We'll come to that now, Sergeant. We've just prevented a kidnapping, a robbery or even a murder. My friend here caught one of the attackers. Let's come to it now, shall we?\nKYLE: We've only your word as to what he did, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Tell him. Tell him.\nLEELA: The man they were carrying was dead. He had been stabbed through the heart!\nKYLE: Really, Miss. And how can you be sure of that?\nLEELA: I am a warrior of the Sevateem. I know the different sounds of death. Now put our prisoner to the torture!\nKYLE: Well, if that don't take the biscuit. Torture, eh? This isn't the Dark Ages, you know.\nLEELA: Make him talk.\nKYLE: He's a Chinese, if you hadn't noticed. We get a lot of those in here, Limehouse being so close. Him jaw-jaw plenty by and by, eh, Johnny? I've sent for an interpreter.\nDOCTOR: That won't be necessary. I speak Mandarin, Cantonese, all the dialects.\nKYLE: Oh yes?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Ne how ma? Ni chi mao cora (and so on)\nKYLE: Yeah, very remarkable, I'm sure, Doctor, but since you're a party to the case, it isn't proper.\nKYLE: Now what? That come from the river.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nWOMAN: Look, there it is, guv. See? Look.\nQUICK: Hurry with that boat hook.\nWOMAN: It's a floater, all right. You've got it, guv.\nWOMAN: On my oath, you wouldn't want that served with onions. Never seen anything like it in all my puff. Oh, make an 'orse sick, that would.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKYLE: Good of you to come so prompt, sir.\nCHANG: Not at all, Sergeant. I'm always happy to be of service to the police. What can I do for you this time?\nKYLE: A complaint against this man, sir. The lady and gentleman here swear they saw him, in concert with others not in custody, carrying what appeared to be a body, sir.\nCHANG: Indeed.\nKYLE: A European body as I understand them, sir.\nCHANG: What happened to the others?\nLEELA: They got away. I caught this one.\nCHANG: You caught him? Remarkable.\nDOCTOR: Don't I know you?\nCHANG: I think not.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I've seen you somewhere before.\nCHANG: I understand we all look the same.\nDOCTOR: Are you Chinese? Yes, that's it. We must have. No, I haven't been in China for four hundred years.\nCHANG: Are you taking this matter seriously, Sergeant?\nKYLE: We are, sir. Will you question the man, sir?\nCHANG: Very well.\nCHANG: Can I have paper and pencil, please, Sergeant?\nKYLE: Certainly, sir.\nDOCTOR: Got it! Li H'sen Chang.\nCHANG: What?\nDOCTOR: The Master of Magic and Mesmerism. Show us a trick.\nDOCTOR: Very good. Very good.\nKYLE: I think he's dead, sir.\nDOCTOR: How did you do it?\nCHANG: I did nothing. What are you suggesting.\nDOCTOR: Scorpion venom.\nKYLE: Scorpion venom?\nDOCTOR: Highly concentrated scorpion venom. It killed him almost instantly.\nDOCTOR: The Tong of the Black Scorpion.\nKYLE: Don't know that one, sir.\nDOCTOR: One of the most dangerous politico-criminal organisations in the world. Wouldn't you agree, Li H'sen Chang?\nCHANG: You seem remarkably well-informed, Doctor. Alas, I know nothing of these matters. Most regrettable incident. Goodnight, Sergeant.\nKYLE: Thank you, sir.\nCHANG: I'm sure we shall meet again.\nLEELA: Yes.\nCHANG: Perhaps under more pleasant circumstances.\nKYLE: Well, I don't know what to do about this lot.\nDOCTOR: Then I'll tell you what to do, Sergeant. Organise a post-mortem. I want an analysis of the organs.\nKYLE: You want what, sir?\nDOCTOR: Well naturally I'm going to help. If the Tong of the Black Scorpion's here in London, you're going to need all the help you can get. Now cut along and do as I say. Now!\nKYLE: Yes, sir.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCHANG: Faster, man, faster.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJAGO: Twinkle, twinkle, out in front.\nCASEY: Eh?\nJAGO: Gallery lights still burning.\nCASEY: I'll just go and see to them now, Mister Jago.\nJAGO: Everyone gone?\nCASEY: Aye, just locked up, sir.\nJAGO: I hope those girls go straight home to their digs.\nCASEY: Oh, that they will, sir, with all this in the papers. Nine are missing now, you know.\nJAGO: Nine. There was some fellow in here earlier blaming Chang of all people for some girl's disappearance.\nCASEY: Just vanished off the streets, they have. Mostly in this area, too. What do you think's happened to them, Mister Jago?\nJAGO: Nothing good, Casey, nothing good. That's a stone certainty.\nCASEY: Oh, it says in the paper how it could be jolly Jack at work again.\nJAGO: Jolly Jack?\nCASEY: The Ripper, Mister Jago.\nJAGO: The horrendous hyperbole of Grub Street, Casey.\nCASEY: Eh?\nJAGO: Newspaper gossip. They're probably just stony and scarpered. Cut along now. I'll wait for you here.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJAGO: I was right. It was blood. Blood all over the hand and wrist. How did that get there?\nCASEY: Ready, Mister Jago.\nJAGO: Oh, Casey. Don't ever do that to me again. If the celestial Chang caught me trying to pinch his tricks. I had an idea that his dummy was a midget dressed up, but it's just an ordinary vent's doll.\nCASEY: Are we going to look down the cellar, Mister Jago?\nJAGO: Of course, Casey. Of course. When I promise to do something. Determination, character. After you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: They're what's known as a very dangerous bunch. Fanatical followers of an ancient Chinese god called Weng-Chiang.\nLEELA: The Tong of the Black Scorpion?\nDOCTOR: Yes. His followers believe that one day he'll come back and rule the world.\nLEELA: So what's he like, this Weng-Chiang?\nDOCTOR: Oh, very pleasant company. They say he blew poisonous fumes from his mouth and that he killed men with a white light that shone from his eyes.\nLEELA: Magic!\nDOCTOR: Superstitious rubbish. Here we are.\nQUICK (OOV.): They're in there now, sir.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nQUICK: Taken from the river not half an hour ago. Professor Litefoot's conducting his examination now, sir.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, our case is much more urgent.\nQUICK: I wouldn't go in there if I was you, sir.\nDOCTOR: Don't you worry about it. Don't you worry.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLITEFOOT: Thank you.\nLITEFOOT: Who the devil are you, sir.\nDOCTOR: I'm the Doctor, come to help you.\nLITEFOOT: When I need anyone's help in pathology, I'll ask for it.\nDOCTOR: The constable suggested a drowning case.\nLITEFOOT: Fished from the river, but he wasn't drowned.\nDOCTOR: By the look of those marks, an animal.\nLITEFOOT: Exactly what I think, but what kind of animal leaves mutilations like those?\nDOCTOR: Chisel-like incisors. A rodent?\nLITEFOOT: Yes, but that's impossible. Look at the size of them.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Have you established the cause of death?\nLITEFOOT: Yes, that's another curious thing. All this happened after death.\nDOCTOR: Really?\nLITEFOOT: He was killed by a knife blow to the heart.\nDOCTOR: Are those his clothes?\nQUICK: Yes, sir. I'm just taking them for examination.\nDOCTOR: Hold that.\nLITEFOOT: He was carrying no personal documents, but this indicates he was a licensed cab driver.)\nLITEFOOT: Easy enough to identify the poor chap by his number.\nLEELA: Doctor, those are the clothes the man we saw was wearing.\nDOCTOR: What I'd like to know is, what do you think of these?\nLITEFOOT: Some sort of hair.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I think they're rat hairs.\nLITEFOOT: Rat hairs? Do you know what you're saying, man?\nDOCTOR: Yes, of course I know what I'm saying.\nLITEFOOT: But they're nearly three inches long. Hairs on a rat can't be more than what, quarter of an inch?\nDOCTOR: Interesting, isn't it, because I've just remembered something else about Weng-Chiang.\nLEELA: What?\nDOCTOR: He was the god of abundance. Yes, he made things grow. Can I borrow that?\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nLEELA: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: Stay there, Leela.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Were you trying to attract my attention?\nDOCTOR: What's this?\nLEELA: A Janis thorn.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I thought I told you not to carry\nLEELA: He was trying to kill you.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Oh, well, in that case you'd better come along.\nLEELA: What is it?\nDOCTOR: The entrance to the sewers.\nLEELA: Blood. Is this where they took the body?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nLEELA: Where's it go?\nDOCTOR: Into the Thames eventually. All the sewers are connected.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLEELA: What are those creatures?\nDOCTOR: Rats.\nLEELA: They don't look very dangerous.\nDOCTOR: No, they're not. They're very cunning though.

STREET IN LOP\n(TEGANA takes the phial of poison from his ally and stares at it.)\nTEGANA: I will use it well...on all but the first of Marco Polo's water gourds, for tomorrow, the caravan sets out to cross the Gobi Desert. Now, you will follow us...and on the third night, I will walk back to you...then we're gonna ride back here to Lop, wait for two days...and then...return to the caravan...to collect the...thing of magic...that will bring the mighty Kublai Khan to his knees!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n2: MARCO POLO'S JOURNAL\n(The map illustrates the next stage of the journey of MARCO POLO'S caravan.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Again, POLO writes and narrates his journal. His words are illustrated by the image of the TARDIS once more on the back of a horse-drawn wagon with attendant Mongol bearers.)\nMARCO POLO: (OOV.) I have taken charge of the travellers' unusual caravan, and set out into the Gobi Desert. The journey across this vast ocean of sand is slow and hazardous. To make matters worse, the old Doctor continually shows his disapproval of my action by being both difficult and bad-tempered. For three days now, during which time we have covered no more than thirty miles, I have had to endure his insults.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n3: EXT. GOBI DESERT (NIGHT)\n(The tent has been erected on the sands of the desert.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n4: INT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\n(Inside the main tent, IAN and BARBARA are with MARCO POLO and TEGANA. SUSAN sits quietly nearby. The three people from the TARDIS are no longer in their own clothes but, not allowed access to the TARDIS, wear Chinese clothes. SUSAN wears a two-piece robe which reaches down to the floor, the upper part of which has flower decorations, while IAN wears a jacket which is decorated in Chinese letters. BARBARA'S top is plainer in style. The DOCTOR is absent from the meal which they have just finished. PING-CHO, again carrying out her serving duties, pours some water for IAN.)\nIAN: Thank you, Ping-Cho.\n(He drinks.)\nIAN: How much water does a caravan like this use crossing the Gobi Desert, Marco?\nMARCO POLO: We will use one barrel every five days, Ian. I have allowed for eight gourds to carry us across to the other side.\nTEGANA: The bones of many men who thought they had enough lie bleached in the desert sand.\n(He holds up his bowl to nervous PING-CHO and gives a curt order...)\nTEGANA: More.\nMARCO POLO: I think we should exercise some restraint, Tegana.\n(With some relief, PING-CHO moves off. POLO turns to an upset SUSAN.)\nMARCO POLO: I'm sorry the Doctor wouldn't eat with us this evening.\nSUSAN: Yes, so am I, Messr Marco.\n(Near to tears, she picks up the DOCTOR'S plate.)\nSUSAN: I'll take him his food.\n(SUSAN takes the plate behind a partition into the DOCTOR'S section of the tent. MARCO POLO brings out a chessboard from one of his travel bags.)\nMARCO POLO: A game of chess, Ian?\nIAN: Oh, well I'm not very good, but I'll give you a game.\nMARCO POLO: I gladly accept your challenge.\n(MARCO POLO sets up the chessboard. BARBARA is intrigued by the intricately carved wooden pieces.)\nBARBARA: What magnificent pieces!\nMARCO POLO: Yes, I purchased them in Hormuz, on my first journey to Cathay. Now they go with me everywhere. Do you, er, play...?\n(At that moment, SUSAN, still upset, returns with the untouched plate...)\nSUSAN: I'm sorry, Messr. Marco...\n(She suddenly starts to rush from the tent. BARBARA watches her go but before she can do anything, TEGANA, seemingly oblivious to what has happened, speaks to BARBARA with unusual courtesy...)\nTEGANA: Do you play chess, lady?\nBARBARA: Not very well, Tegana.\n(BARBARA, concerned with SUSAN'S sudden departure, decides to follow the girl.)\nBARBARA: Excuse me.\n(She walks from the tent. IAN and MARCO POLO prepare for their game of chess. TEGANA watches them with interest.)\nTEGANA: I find it a fascinating game of...strategy of war. Two equally balanced armies deployed upon a field of battle, and each commander determined to be the one who cries \"Shahmat\".\nIAN: (Puzzled.) Shahmat? Checkmate?\nTEGANA: (Quietly.) It means the king is dead.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n5: EXT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\n(BARBARA finds SUSAN standing outside the main tent. She is still clearly upset. There is a strong wind starting to blow.)\nBARBARA: We'll get the TARDIS back, Susan.\nSUSAN: Yes, but at Kublai Khan's Court, when it's too late.\n(She stares sadly up into the stars in the night sky.)\nSUSAN: We should be up there - another time, another galaxy.\nBARBARA: Oh, we'll think of something.\nSUSAN: How? Ian playing chess with Marco? Grandfather being rude and sulking by himself?\nBARBARA: Oh, I didn't know he's sulking, is he?\nSUSAN: Well, he won't eat. He won't even talk to me.\nBARBARA: Well, you know him better than I do. But I'd have said he was just feeling defenceless. He has a wonderful machine, capable of all sorts of miracles, and it's taken away from him by a man he calls a primitive. Look, TARDIS is the only home we have at the moment, and when we're in it, we feel safe and secure. But when we're out of it...\n(She looks out across the desert and sighs.)\nSUSAN: Will he talk to me? Confide in me?\nBARBARA: Oh, he's like a rubber ball. He'll come bouncing out of there soon full of ideas.\n(SUSAN stares back at the sky.)\nSUSAN: One day, we'll know all the mysteries of the skies...and we'll stop our wandering...\nBARBARA: Then you and I will say good-bye.\nSUSAN: (Surprised.) Hum? Oh, not yet. Not for a long time!\nBARBARA: Well, I think we should say goodnight anyway.\nSUSAN: Are you coming?\nBARBARA: No, not for the moment.\nSUSAN: Goodnight.\n(SUSAN runs back towards the main tent.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n6: INT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\n(SUSAN appears in the tent. The chess match is in progress and IAN, POLO and TEGANA stare intently at the board...)\nSUSAN: Ping-Cho?\nMARCO POLO: Shh! She's gone to bed.\nSUSAN: Oh, well...I'll go too then. Goodnight.\nIAN: Goodnight, Susan.\nMARCO POLO: Sleep well.\n(As SUSAN leaves to go to her room, MARCO POLO turns back to the chessboard.)\nMARCO POLO: Now, what was I about to do? Ah yes...\n(He moves a piece.)\nIAN: Ouch!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n7: INT. TENT. PING-CHO AND SUSAN'S ROOM (NIGHT)\n(SUSAN enters the room she shares with PING-CHO and sees that the young girl is not yet in bed but staring out of a side-flap in the tent.)\nSUSAN: Not asleep yet?\nPING-CHO: No, I was thinking.\nSUSAN: What about?\nPING-CHO: How peaceful it is in the desert.\n(SUSAN joins her and looks out.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n8: EXT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\nSUSAN: Oh, it's a lovely night!\nPING-CHO: The moon will rise later. That is the time to see the desert. It is like a great silver sea.\nSUSAN: (Almost to herself.) The metal seas of Venus...\nPING-CHO: Where?\nSUSAN: Oh, a long way from here. I've never seen a moonlit night. How long before the moon rises?\nPING-CHO: Two or three hours. I'll call you then.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n9: INT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\n(In the main tent, the sight of the Gobi Desert at night has also captivated BARBARA. She returns to the three men and their chess game.)\nBARBARA: Night in the desert is very beautiful.\nMARCO POLO: Don't be deceived by it, Miss Wright. The desert is always dangerous.\n(IAN is concentrating on the chess game.)\nIAN: Like my Queen!\n(He moves a piece, still watched intently by TEGANA.)\nIAN: Check!\nTEGANA: Oh, Marco, can you save your King?\nMARCO POLO: I think so, Tegana.\n(MARCO POLO studies the board carefully before making a move.)\nMARCO POLO: Check.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n10: EXT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\n(Later on that night, when the rest of the camp is silent, SUSAN and PING-CHO emerge through the flap from their room in the tent. The moon has risen, and the two girls view the illuminated desert in amazement.)\nSUSAN: (In wonder.) Oh crazy! Hey, Ping-cho...!\nPING-CHO: Shh! The guard will hear you. (Puzzled.) Crazy?\nSUSAN: Hmm? It means I dig it. You know - like it.\nPING-CHO: This language of yours is very strange.\n(At that moment, TEGANA emerges from the main tent. He has a brief conversation with one of the Mongol bearers, and then moves off into the desert.)\nPING-CHO: Tegana!\nSUSAN: Let's follow him.\nPING-CHO: He will be angry!\nSUSAN: You're not afraid?\nPING-CHO: No, I am not. Come.\n(They follow TEGANA into the desert.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n11: INT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\n(IAN and MARCO POLO are sleeping in the main area of the tent on makeshift beds. Outside, the sounds of the horses becoming restless can be heard. The whinnying of the horses eventually wakes MARCO POLO. He gets up and moves to the doorway. IAN also wakes.)\nIAN: What is it, Marco?\nMARCO POLO: The horses are very restless.\n(IAN gets up and the two of them move outside as the horses whinny again.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n12: EXT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\n(They peer across the desert.)\nMARCO POLO: There's a sandstorm coming, Ian.\nIAN: How do you know?\nMARCO POLO: Notice how still it is - as if everything were waiting.\n(There is another whinny.)\nMARCO POLO: They sense it too.\nIAN: Will it be a bad one?\nMARCO POLO: Bad enough. I must attend to the horses.\n(He moves off.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n13: EXT. DESERT (NIGHT)\n(SUSAN and PING-CHO continue following TEGANA through the desert. They are finding it difficult to keep up with the pace TEGANA is setting over the high dunes and deep furrows of sand, and are beginning to lose the warlord.)\nSUSAN: He walks so quickly. Can you still see him?\nPING-CHO: Yes. There he is, over there.\n(PING-CHO points out into the desert. Suddenly, SUSAN sits on the ground in exhaustion.)\nSUSAN: Oh, let's give up.\nPING-CHO: Who is afraid now?\nSUSAN: No, I'm not afraid. It's...it's just that it's so hot. I can hardly breathe.\nPING-CHO: Yet it was most pleasant when we left the caravan.\n(SUSAN gets up.)\nSUSAN: Oh, come on, let's go back.\nPING-CHO: All right.\n(They start to clamber back over the dunes.)\nPING-CHO: Susan, listen!\n(SUSAN does so, and manages to hear the faint sounds of swirling wind. SUSAN suddenly sees something.)\nSUSAN: What's that?\nPING-CHO: Where?\n(SUSAN points towards a hazy mist on the horizon as the wind starts to get louder.)\nSUSAN: That cloud on the horizon.\n(PING-CHO sees the ominous clouds of billowing sand.)\nPING-CHO: Susan, it's a sandstorm!\nSUSAN: What! It's coming this way! Ping-Cho, we must get back before it reaches us!\nPING-CHO: No, the caravan is too far away!\n(SUSAN tries to drag her away.)\nSUSAN: (Shouts.) No, come on! We must get back. We can't stay here!\nPING-CHO: (Shouts.) No, we'll get caught in it - and we'll never find our way!\nSUSAN: (Shouts.) Ping-Cho, come on!\nPING-CHO: (Shouts.) No, we must shelter here.\nSUSAN: (Shouts.) No!\n(The wind begins to fiercely swirl around them.)\nPING-CHO: (Shouts.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The two girls hold on to each other as they are caught in the sandstorm.)\nSUSAN: (Shouts.) Ping-Cho!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPING-CHO: (Shouts.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Their cries and the sound of the blasting wind mingles with the noise of the \"singing\" sands which manifests itself as a series of shrieks and babbles.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n14: INT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\n(Back at the main tent, BARBARA is woken by the sounds of the approaching sandstorm, and appears from her section of the tent. IAN and MARCO are back inside. They have to shout to make themselves heard over the shrieks of the storm.)\nBARBARA: (Shouts.) Ian, what is it? What's happened?\nIAN: (Shouts.) Don't be afraid, Barbara. It's a sandstorm.\nBARBARA: (Shouts.) But the...\nIAN: (Shouts.) It sounds as if all the devils in hell were laughing!\nMARCO POLO: (Shouts.) It's the wind shifting the sand!\nBARBARA: (Shouts.) It's terrifying!\nMARCO POLO: Not always, Barbara. Sometimes it sounds like musical instruments being played - the clashing of drums and cymbals. I've heard it sound like a great many people talking as they travelled across the desert. It can also be like a...like a familiar voice calling your name. You're not the only one to be afraid. Travellers of the Gobi Desert have good reason to fear the singing sands, Barbara.\n(MARCO walks off. IAN looks towards the DOCTOR'S room in the tent.)\nIAN: (Shouts.) It's fantastic that the Doctor's still asleep!\n(MARCO rushes back.)\nMARCO POLO: Tegana's not here! His bed's empty!\nIAN: (Shouts.) What?!\nMARCO POLO: Has anyone seen him?\nIAN: Well, he can't be out in this!\nMARCO POLO: He must be!\nBARBARA: Well, what will happen to him?\nMARCO POLO: If he finds shelter, he'll be all right!\nBARBARA: Well...well, can't we do anything?\nMARCO POLO: Nothing.\n(IAN and MARCO POLO listen helplessly as the sand swirls outside.)\nBARBARA: I think I'll see if the girls are all right...\n(She goes towards the girl's room.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n15: INT. TENT. PING-CHO AND SUSAN'S ROOM (NIGHT)\n(She sees that the room is empty.)\nBARBARA: Ping-Cho!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n16: INT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\nMARCO POLO: (To IAN.) Tegana's no fool. He can look after himself. Don't worry...\n(BARBARA runs back from the girl's room in a hysterical condition.)\nBARBARA: (Shouts.) They're gone...they're not there!\nIAN: (Shouts.) Gone?\nBARBARA: (Shouts.) Their beds are empty!\n(BARBARA rushes for the door. IAN and MARCO POLO hold her back and she struggles in their grasp.)\nIAN: (Shouts.) Wait!\nMARCO POLO: (Shouts.) No!\nIAN: (Shouts.) Barbara!\nMARCO POLO: (Shouts.) Barbara, you can't go out there!\nBARBARA: (Shouts.) Let go!\nMARCO POLO: (Shouts.) Barbara, you'll be lost in seconds!\nBARBARA: (Shouts.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIAN: (Shouts.) Calm down, Barbara! Marco is right - there's nothing we can do!\nBARBARA: (Shouts.) The girls!\nIAN: (Shouts.) We must wait until the storm blows itself out!\nMARCO POLO: (Shouts.) There's nothing we can do now!\n(BARBARA rounds on POLO, sobbing.)\nBARBARA: (Shouts.) Oh, it's all your fault anyway! If you hadn't kept us prisoner here, none of this would have happened!\n(The babbling and shrieking of the storm reaches a new crescendo.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n17: EXT. DESERT (NIGHT)\n(SUSAN and PING-CHO huddle closer to one another as the sandstorm billows around them. SUSAN thinks she can hear her name being called with the chatters and shrieks. The voice she hears is deep and booming...)\nVOICE: Ssuuuuuussssaaaaaaaannnnnnnn!\nSUSAN: Ping-Cho, what's that?\nVOICE: Ssuuuuuussssaaaaaaaannnnnnnn!\nSUSAN: (Shouts.) There it is again...It's Ian...I can hear him!\n(An insane monkey-like babble echoes through the storm.)\nVOICE: Ssuuuuuussssaaaaaaaannnnnnnn!\nSUSAN: (Shouts.) It's Ian!\nPING-CHO: (Shouts.) Susan, it isn't! It's the desert saying it!\nSUSAN: (Shouts.) It is! It's Ian! Ian!\n(SUSAN pushes PING-CHO away and tries to scramble up a dune.)\nSUSAN: (Shouts.) Ian! Ian, we're here! Ian!\n(She suddenly sees a shadow looming over her from out of the sand. She screams...)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n18: INT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\n(IAN waits impatiently for the storm to pass.)\nIAN: How soon can we go and look for them?\nMARCO POLO: Not until it's light.\nIAN: Let me go as soon as the storm's over!\nMARCO POLO: Ian, you'd miss them in the dark. You must wait till it's light!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n19: EXT. DESERT (NIGHT)\n(SUSAN recognises the figure as TEGANA. The warlord looks down at the two cowering girls.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n20: INT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\n(The storm has passed. IAN, BARBARA and MARCO POLO wait in the main tent. BARBARA is frantic with worry and impatience.)\nBARBARA: (Shouts.) We can't just go on sitting here!\n(IAN looks towards the DOCTOR'S room.)\nIAN: Shh! The Doctor's still asleep. We don't want him to know about the girls.\nMARCO POLO: Barbara, I give you my word that until we find the girls, we will not leave this place.\n(The group looks up, startled, as TEGANA, SUSAN and PING-CHO enter the tent. BARBARA jumps up and rushes to SUSAN.)\nBARBARA: Susan! Do you know you had us half-worried to death. Where've you been?\nSUSAN: (Quietly.) We went for a walk.\nBARBARA: A walk!\nMARCO POLO: (Furious.) Without asking me?! Don't you dare do that again! Do you understand? That also applies for you, Ping-Cho.\nSUSAN: I'm sorry, Messr Marco. Has...has Grandfather been very worried?\nIAN: Luckily for you, he's been asleep the whole time.\nMARCO POLO: And we don't want him to know anything about this.\n(He looks at the Mongol warlord.)\nMARCO POLO: I'm surprised that you'd encourage such a venture, Tegana.\nTEGANA: (Surprised.) Ahh...they weren't with me! I found them - crouched behind a sand dune.\nMARCO POLO: (Puzzled.) You were alone?\nTEGANA: (Nonchalantly.) Ah, well, it was a pleasant night. I decided for a walk. I told the guard - he knew all about it.\nMARCO POLO: (Sternly.) In future, the guards will be told to notify me immediately if any of you wish to leave the camp.\n(He looks at the bedraggled girls.)\nMARCO POLO: Now go and change, we have to break camp soon.\nSUSAN: Yes, Messr Marco.\n(SUSAN and PING-CHO walk off. BARBARA approaches MARCO POLO who is starting to pack his things.)\nBARBARA: This has been a terrible experience for us all, Marco. Couldn't we spend one more night here?\nMARCO POLO: I'm sorry, Miss Wright.\nBARBARA: But surely one day can't make all that much difference?\nMARCO POLO: One day without progress is one day's water wasted. And in the Gobi Desert, that could mean the difference between life and death.\n(Behind them, TEGANA walks back outside unseen...)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n21: EXT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\n(Outside, he removes the phial of poison from his pocket. He studies the poison carefully.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n22: MARCO POLO'S JOURNAL\n(MARCO POLO writes in his journal. The map illustrates their place in the desert.)\nMARCO POLO: (OOV.) Progress today has been good, although we were all very tired after a sleepless night. How can I ever repay Tegana for saving Ping-Cho and Susan? We covered fifteen miles before I gave the order to set up camp for the night.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n23: INT. TENT: PING-CHO AND SUSAN'S ROOM (NIGHT)\n(SUSAN is frantically brushing her hair as PING-CHO enters.)\nPING-CHO: Susan! Susan!\n(SUSAN continues brushing.)\nSUSAN: I can't get this sand out of my hair.\nPING-CHO: Last night there were moments when I was sure I would never be here again.\n(PING-CHO settles down in her bed. SUSAN finishes her hair and lowers her voice...)\nSUSAN: Ping-Cho, did you believe Tegana last night, when he told Messr Marco about going for a walk?\nPING-CHO: Why not?\nSUSAN: Well, I don't think Tegana's the kind of man who goes for a walk just because it's a nice night. I think he goes because he has a reason to go.\nPING-CHO: Susan, why would he lie to Messr Marco?\nSUSAN: I don't know!\nPING-CHO: He's an important man - the special emissary of the great Mongol leader who has been at war with Kublai Khan. Tegana is to arrange a peaceful settlement between them. Would a man like that lie about walking in the desert?\nSUSAN: No! No, he wouldn't. That's what's so strange...\nPING-CHO: What?\nSUSAN: The fact that he did.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n24: INT. MAIN TENT (NIGHT)\n(In the main tent, TEGANA is polishing his sword, while MARCO POLO writes in his journal.)\nTEGANA: What is that you do?\nMARCO POLO: I keep a journal.\nTEGANA: Why?\nMARCO POLO: Because it interests me.\n(MARCO POLO continues to write. Suddenly, TEGANA yells out POLO'S name...)\nTEGANA: Marco!\n(...and lunges at MARCO POLO with his sword. POLO reacts quickly to parry the blow.)\nTEGANA: (Admiringly.) That's excellent, excellent! But it's better a man keeps the blade of his sword clean...than its edge sharp. You continue your writing, Marco. I'll see to the horses tonight.\n(He heads for the door.)\nTEGANA: I'll, er, I'll give the guard his instructions.\nMARCO POLO: No! Send him to me.\n(TEGANA hesitates.)\nMARCO POLO: Please.\n(TEGANA leaves.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n25: EXT. THE WATER WAGON (NIGHT)\n(Once outside the main tent, TEGANA walks towards the wagon containing the water gourds. There is a guard there. TEGANA whistles and this draws the guard away. TEGANA then moves to the back of the wagon and stabs each gourd with his sword. The precious water splashes all over the ground.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n26: EXT. THE WATER WAGON\n(The next morning, IAN, MARCO POLO and BARBARA survey the damage caused to their water supply.)\nIAN: All of them, Marco?\nMARCO POLO: Yes, except for the one we're using.\n(They walk round the wagon and look over the gourds.)\nIAN: How much is there left?\nMARCO POLO: Without rationing, enough for today.\nIAN: And with rationing, how long will it last?\nMARCO POLO: Three - four days.\nBARBARA: Is there enough to get us back to Lop?\nMARCO POLO: If we're very careful with it, yes.\nIAN: But who could have done it?\nMARCO POLO: Bandits, Ian.\nBARBARA: (Surprised.) Bandits? In the desert?\nMARCO POLO: Yes, this has happened before, but not to me. The bandits follow a caravan out into the desert. Then one night, this happens. The caravan is forced to turn back. Then, when everyone is weak through lack of water, the bandits attack.\nIAN: So if we turn back, we're bound to be attacked.\nMARCO POLO: Yes.\n(TEGANA silently joins the group having heard this exchange.)\nTEGANA: Then we shall fight.\nIAN: There must be somewhere else we can go to?\nMARCO POLO: The nearest is a small oasis, but that's one week's journey north from here.\nIAN: Marco, if we pressed really hard, walked day and night, how long would it take us?\nMARCO POLO: Five, possibly six days.\nIAN: As long as that?\nMARCO POLO: Yes, and with the water rationed we'll be growing weaker all the time. There is another danger, Ian - bandits always camp near an oasis.\nBARBARA: Well, then we must go back to Lop.\nIAN: But they're bound to be waiting for us there! No, we must go north, and take a chance.\nMARCO POLO: Yes, what Ian says makes sense. We go to the oasis.\nTEGANA: We shall all die of thirst. I will not go.\nMARCO POLO: Then what will you do?\nTEGANA: Return to Lop. I'm not afraid of any bandits. Just give me my share of the water...\nMARCO POLO: (Interrupts.) No, Tegana.\nTEGANA: (Quietly menacing.) You refuse the Warlord Tegana?\nMARCO POLO: I am commander of this caravan, and I am responsible to Kublai Khan for your safety. We go north, together.\n(Defeated for the moment, TEGANA stares at POLO...)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n27: MARCO POLO'S JOURNAL\n(The map shows the slow progress that the caravan is making.)\nMARCO POLO: (OOV.) Have I made the right decision? Each day, our progress towards the oasis becomes less. On the first day, we covered twenty miles. On the second, fifteen. The third, ten. The fourth day's total was eight. Now on the fifth day we have travelled only two miles before the heat of the sun has forced us to stop. We are nearly exhausted, and our situation is perilous...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n28: EXT. DESERT. CAMP\n(The sun continues to beat down relentlessly on the caravan. The weary travellers, now including the DOCTOR, lie motionless in the shade of the wagons underneath an awning gazing out across the merciless baking sands. MARCO POLO comes along and shares out the last few drops of water.)\nMARCO POLO: The worst of the sun is nearly over. We must move on again as soon we've had this.\n(Everyone drinks his or her water in silence. They are all seriously affected by heat exhaustion.)\nIAN: Have the bearers had their ration?\n(MARCO nods and pours IAN his water but the ration runs out before MARCO can take his.)\nIAN: You take it.\nMARCO POLO: We will share.\n(IAN accepts the offer and drinks.)\nDOCTOR: Marco, is this all we're going to get until tonight, mm?\nMARCO POLO: Until we reach the oasis, Doctor, yes.\nDOCTOR: Mmm.\nBARBARA: There's no more?\n(MARCO shakes his head.)\nTEGANA: How much further?\nMARCO POLO: I cannot say.\nTEGANA: I will go to the oasis and bring back water.\n(TEGANA stands and starts to stumble towards where his horse is reined.)\nMARCO POLO: Do you think you could reach the oasis?\nTEGANA: Yes, my...my horse is still the strongest.\n(POLO considers.)\nMARCO POLO: Very well, Tegana.\n(TEGANA stumbles away but stops for a last word...)\nTEGANA: You, er, wait for me here.\nMARCO POLO: No, while we can, we'll push on towards the oasis.\n(TEGANA considers...)\nTEGANA: Right.\n(TEGANA leaves to fetch his horse. IAN calls out weakly after him.)\nIAN: Good luck, Tegana...\nMARCO POLO: We must go.\n(The group gets up and prepares to leave.)\nDOCTOR: Susan...help me up...\n(Suddenly, as SUSAN helps him, the DOCTOR collapses unconscious.)\nSUSAN: Oh, Grandfather!\n(IAN rushes over to assist.)\nSUSAN: What's the...what the matter with him?\nIAN: He's exhausted.\nMARCO POLO: We'll fix up a cot for him in the wagon.\nBARBARA: To be jostled and bumped about? He needs to rest in comfort, Marco. What about the TARDIS?\n(POLO hesitates...)\nIAN: He'd be more comfortable, Marco.\n(Still he doesn't answer. The three companions of the DOCTOR look at him pleadingly.)\nSUSAN: Please, Messr Marco!\n(POLO reaches a decision with reluctance.)\nMARCO POLO: Very well. The Doctor can travel in his own caravan. Susan, you can go with him. But you, Barbara, and you, Ian, must remain with me.\nIAN: Thank you.\n(He takes POLO to one side in order that the others don't hear him.)\nIAN: Marco...without water, the Doctor isn't going to last twenty-four hours.\nMARCO POLO: None of us are, Ian - without water. (Sighs.) Our fate rests with Tegana.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n29: EXT. OASIS\n(TEGANA has arrived at the oasis and is greedily drinking the water. Behind him are the remains of man-made structures - posts standing starkly against the desert sky. He fills a water gourd, and stands, triumphantly holding it to the sky.)\nTEGANA: Here's water, Marco Polo!\n(He tips the gourd and pours the contents over the sand by the pool.)\nTEGANA: Come for it!\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

They come across a man named Tegana, who claims to have found a water source. Marco Polo and his companions decide to trust Tegana and allow him to bring them water. However, Tegana is greedy and only brings them a small amount of water. Marco Polo and his companions are forced to continue their journey without enough water, and the Doctor becomes ill.</s>The invention provides a method for preparing a high-purity nano-silicon powder, which comprises the following steps:"

        "prompt_0": "Lucas: Do you ever wonder how long it takes to change your life? What measure of time is enough to be life altering? Is it four years like high school? One year? An eight-week rock tour? Can your life change in a month, or a week, or a single day? We're always in a hurry, to grow up, to go places, to get ahead. But when you're young, one hour can change everything.\nKarl: How are we doing this mornig seniors? Did anyone wake up with their clothes on from the night before still drunk with strange big hangover? Anyone? Well I guess that was just me. Actually last night was UNO night at my house, and it was a blood bath but I cannot discuss it with you right now, so we won't. But let me ask you guys a question: does today's class really matter? Or is it just a fifty-minute requirement designed to get your grades so you can go on to college or a job and the rest of your lives, anyone?\nBrooke: If we say yes, can we have the grade and go on with the rest of our lives?\nKarl: Mouth, using one word describe how your classmates see you.\nMouth: Ugh, awesome?\nLucas: Yep!\nKarl: Ok. Let's say that there are five universal terms to describe everyone in high school, okay? Let's say jock, prom queen, geek, loaner, and ...?\nBrooke: Slut?\nKarl: Okay, considering that awesome is not a category, Shelly Simon, describe Mouth in one word.\nShelly: I don't really know him, but, nice, I guess.\nKarl: Nice. I suppose we could find 'nice' under friendly, but since friendly doesn't mean friendly that would make Mouth a slut. You have four other choices.\nShelly: Geek I guess.\nKarl: Geek? You're joining the club Mouth. Okay, class, Nathan five choices?\nEveryone: Jock.\nKarl: Lucas?\nEveryone: Jock.\nKarl: Brooke?\nEveryone: Prom queen.\nKarl: Rachel?\nEveryone: Friendly!\nRachel: Hey!\nKarl: Peyton?\nEveryone: Prom queen.\nPeyton: Oh come on I am so a loaner!\nGlenda: Right, a loaner cheerleader who's dating a jock. No offence but I'm a loaner, you're a prom queen.\nKarl: Like it or not, you are who you classmates see you as. But here's the good news: that's gonna change soon. Because prett y soon you're gonna be going out into that big, wild world and you can erase all those [...]. Now for some of you shading this image is gonna be a great thing. And for some of you, not such a great thing. But what matters is that you know who you really are. And you know how you want the world to see you. Well, you've been together for what? For four years? Haley? What's Lucas' middle name?\nHaley: Eugene. Ohh, I'm sorry I'm so sorry.\nKarl: Lucas what's Glenda's last name?\nLucas: I don't know. Sorry.\nKarl: Okay everyone on this side of the room I want you to write your name on a piece of paper and put it in Nathan's cap. Okay, hurry up. Everyone on this side of the room is gonna draw a name. And the name that you draw will be the person that you will spend the rest of the class with. Maybe we'll find out if fifty minutes can matter. Okay pass the hat around. Shelly who do you have?\nShelly: Mouth.\nKarl: Karma's a funny thing isn't it? Haley?\nHaley: Skills...ington.\nKarl: Rachel?\nRachel: Bevin.\nKarl: Glenda?\nGlenda: Gotta love karma... Lucas.\nKarl: Nora?\nNora: Oh, I have Noriah.\nKarl: Emma?\nEmma: I've got Zach.\nKarl: Michael?\nMicheal: I got Fedde.\nKarl: Brooke?\nBrokke: I have Chase.\nKarl: Peyton?\nPeyton: I have... Nathan.\nKarl: Okay here's the deal, everyone pair up, you can leave the class but not the campus. At the door you'l find a camera, I want each of you, at the end of the class to take a picture of your partner. This picture represents how you see them. That picture is going into the year book for the rest of time. Now for some of you this is an opportunity to reinvent youself starting today.\nBrooke: Do we have to reinvent ouselves, cause I think most of my friends see me as fabulous!\nKarl: Maybe so. But my friend Mr Miller sees you as the girl who's failing calculus. Okay everyone go and get a camera and get out of here. Oh wait one more thing, with the cameras a list of instructions at the end of the class I want you to tell me what you learnt about your partner. You have fifty minutes, go.\nMouth: Well I guess you're stuck with the geek.\nSkills: Okay Haley J.S. Let me make a deal with you, as long as you don't give birth early, we're good.\nBevin: I don't get it.\nLucas: I'm Lucas...\nGlenda: Scott. Right. At least i know your last name.\nNathan: This is kinda like the Boy Trade, actually we won't be kissing and the partial nudity.\nPeyton: The hour is still young.\nBrooke: So about this whole calculus thing...\nLucas: Glenda! Glenda. I'm sorry about not knowing your name. Can we just do the assignment? Look the first thing on the list it's huh... 'share something personal with your partner'.\nGlenda: Farell, my last name's Farell. Is that personal enough for you?\nBrooke: Will you just listen to me please?\nChase: So what? You accidently forgot to tell me that you were failing calculus when you started tutoring me... in calculus. How did you get that A I saw on your test anyway?\nBrooke: It's complicated trust me.\nChase: Trust you... I already did that. And now I find that my tutor is doing worse in calculus than I.\nBrooke: It's a long story okay?\nChase: Well don't tell me other story Brooke! Tell me the truth. Or is that even possible for you to do?\nBrooke: Okay. Come on.\nMouth: You know you shouldn't judge people like that. You called me a geek!\nShelly: It was the only category that fit. I called you nice first.\nMouth: Well how do you know I'm nice? Maybe I'm not nice.\nShelly: I can see that.\nMouth: We're supposed to tell each other something personal. Like... huh... my middle name is Leonardo, after my grandpa Leo. I guess that's kinda geeky.\nShelly: Wow you really got personal there.\nMouth: Well it's not like you're gonna tell me anything real either right? It's just an assignment.\nShelly: Before I started Clean Teens, I was in a serious relationship with this guy I met at summer camp. I was pretty intense. And then, we couldn't see each other for the rest of the summer. My parents, they wouldn't let me talk to him or... anything. But I knew I'd see him when we'd got back to school on the fall. And, the night before we got back I couldn't sleep. This is the spot I was standing at when I finally saw him again... with his new girlfriend. He looked at me, you know, he looked right at me, and then he just walked away, without a word. It was just over. That's the moment I thought of Clean Teens. Like you said, it's not like I'm actually gonna tell you anything real.\nHaley: Okay pregant girl on the roof!\nSkills: Come on, [...] we had a deel, no early delivers!\nHaley: Right!\nSkills: Now check it out you're gonna love this view, it's the [...]\nHaley: Wow, this view really is the [...].\nSkills: You see that factory way out there? I might possibly work in this [...] graduate in Tree Hill. Six days a week on [...]. So we're supposed to tell each other something personal right?\nHaley: Yeah.\nSkills: Ok, well, here's mine. There's a job waiting for me in that place, if I don't get a scholarship to college.\nHaley: It's not gonna happen Skills. I can feel it!\nSkills: I'm glad you're so sure.\nHaley: NO, the baby's kiking I can feel it! Here!\nSkills: It's like a step show.\nHaley: Something personal right?\nSkills: Yeah!\nPeyton: So I guess I was right about the partial nudity thing. Boys lockroom?\nNathan: Just following the assignment.\nPeyton: Ok.\nNathan: You see this [...]? The summer I decided t really dedicate myself to basketball, my dad said I was way too skinny to ever be a great player. He said I wasn't tough enough, that I wasn't stong enough. So to prove him wrong, I spent every single day in this training room. It was like a thousand degrees in it, but I wasn't gonna let him be right.\nPeyton: Anger's motivation.\nNathan: Anger and inspiration. Everytime I benched another ten pounds, I scratched two letters, under the plate.\nPeyton: What does it say? PS?\nNathan: It was the same summer we started dating. We were pretty good together weren't we?\nPeyton: Gimme your hand. Ok, I want you to feel this.\nNathan: Geez what happened?\nPeyton: I broke that neckle punching something after we've broken up for like the twentieth time! We were horrible together!\nNathan: Yeah, I know, I was kinda hoping you forgot.\nPeyton: No.\nBevin: Ok so I don't get it. We're supposed to do these stuff on the list and then take a picture for the year book.\nRachel: That's the plan!\nBevin: Well I already took my photo for the year book, and my hair looked really pretty that day.\nRachel: It's not that kind of photo... and anyway it doesn't matter because this assignment makes me wanna get high.\nBevin: Seriously.\nRachel: You're not listening, see: this assignment makes me wanna get high.\nBrooke: I got a copy of the key and I stole the test.\nChase: It's great Brooke, anything else?\nBrooke: I don't really believe in Clean Teens I just stayed in it because of you. That's the one thing I was really truthful about: my feelings for you.\nChase: Well it doesn't matter now does it?\nMouth: Anyone for starting over?\nShelly: Hey. I'm sorry about judging you. You seem like a really nice guy.\nMouth: Ok you gotta stop saying that!\nShelly: Why?\nMouth: Because that's part of the problem! I hate being the nice guy, the little brother, the great friend. For just once, I'd like to be a little dangerous you know. Not so safe.\nShelly: Yeah.\nMouth: So, what's next on the list?\nShelly: Ok: lighten up. Do an impression of a celebrity or a famous character.\nMouth: This is gonna be awesome baby! He's a [...], a [...] magician! It's Dick Vitale. He's a sports annoucer. He's really famous.\nLucas: You seem so familiar love. Have I threatened you before? I'm captain Jack Sparrow.\nHaley: So my sister Mary Kate was like: Ashley, you really need to eat something.\nLucas: Merry Christmas you [...]!\nNathan: I like you, do you like me?\nPeyton: I like sexytime explosion!\nHaley: I'm sorry Dawson, it's just, I love Pacey.\nBrooke: Happy Birthday Mister President.\nHaley: Say hello to my little friend!\nNathan: My wife, she's very nice. Hi 5!\nLucas: My precious, oh my precious gotta keep it from the hobbitses, oh the hobbitses!\nGlenda: You do a really good Elmo.\nShelly: Admit something that worries you or something you're afraid of.\nMouth: You.\nShelly: Me? Why?\nMouth: Because you're really pretty. And it's kinda intimidating.\nNathan: I walked a hundred times in the gim, thousands of fans screaming at me, taunting me, I never flinched. I just take it all and [...]. No fear. But the thought of being a father scares the hell out of me.\nHaley: I love the idea of being a mom. I really do. But, I just, I still wanna leave my mark on this world.\nSkills: That what scares you? Not having the chance to do that?\nHaley: Yeah, a little. And clowns. Clowns really scare me.\nBevin: What are you afraid of Rachel? Rachel?\nRachel: I'm afraid, I'm way too high to care.\nBrooke: I was worried I wouldn't be enough for you. That's why I lied. That's what I'm afraid of. Not being enough. Not good enough, not smart enough, not pretty enough, not...\nChase: Brooke, you're the student council president, captain of the Cheerleaders and probably one of the most popular girls of the school! How is that not good enough?\nBrooke: I don't know you should ask my parents, considering they haven't called in a month. A month and a half, actually. Not a single call, or texto, or email so what do you suppose that says about me?\nChase: I think it says more about your parents.\nBrooke: You haven't told me what you're afraid of.\nGlenda: I'm afraid of my mom.\nLucas: Come on, is she really that bad?\nGlenda: You see these diamond earings? I can only wear them at school because I stole them from her.\nLucas: Why?\nGlenda: Because she loves them more than me. How about you?\nLucas: I'm killing two birds in one stone. Something personal and something I'm afraid of. This is the first draft to a novel I'm writting. This is the personal part.\nGlenda: Who knew?\nLucas: No one.\nGlenda: How come?\nLucas: My first dream was to play professional basketball, I already gave that up. You're holding my second dream. If this thing sucks it's gonna be kinda hard to find a third one.\nBevin: Ok, where do you plan to be in ten years?\nRachel: In ten years, I plan to be twenty eight.\nBevin: Not at this rate.\nBrooke: I want my fashionline to be hugely successful.\nChase: I'd like to be a pilot. I always wanted to fly. Shat off to far away places.\nBrooke: Milan.\nChase: Why not? That or be an X Game champion. That would make Clean Teens a bad ass!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNathan: Oh I hope in ten years, Haley's got a bunch of platine albums, my dad learnt how to be a great grandparent, my mom's alive and sober and hopefully my son will have a kickass of a drible!\nPeyton: Ok, but the question is about you duffus! Where do you plan to be in ten years?\nNatan: I know, but if everbody else's dreams come true, then, I'll be fine.\nPeyton: Nate, I think it's great that you take care of Haley, and that you're worried about your family, but if you don't start putting yourself first every once in a while, and chasing your own dream, then, I'm scared you're gonna wake up one day, and have to wonder what could have been, like Dan. Don't be haunted like that Nate.\nSkills: You know basketball is global now right? I mean, everybody thinks being a pro is just NBA. Me I'd be happy just playing backetball oversea somewhere. So we [...] on a world tour, we'll remember this day and [...] a laugh about it.\nHaley: Ohhh man, I'd love to play music for living, but, if that doesn't happen I'll also be happy.\nSkills: Yeah? Doing what?\nShelly: You know I don't know yet. But, whatever it is it's gonna be ok because I'll have a great group of friends, that I can laugh with and a few secret comforts that keep me sain, like I want a grey big [...] cat that greets me when I come home. And a boy, that I'm in love with. Yeah, in ten years I'm definitely in love.\nLucas: Oh if I don't make it as a writter I can at least come back here and coach the Ravens. I mean Whitey's retired, my mom's here, and besides I love this place.\nGlenda: Not me. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm going as far away as I can get, and I'm gonna try to forget this place ever existed.\nHaley: I never thought about teaching until now but, I thing I could be really happy doing that. When I tutor someone, and I watch them get it like that light goes on, it just feels really good. Anyway.\nSkills: So look we got one more thing to do, before we take our pictures. Tell your partner a secret. This one will do some damages.\nBrooke: Rachel bet me that I couldn't sleep with you within three dates.\nChase: Well.\nBrooke: But I need you to know something. I would have never ever asked you to compromise what you believe in or try to presure you out of it. That's the truth. And I just need you to know it. Even though I kno I don't have a chance with you now.\nChase: Is that it? No more secrets?\nBrooke: That's it. I promise.\nChase: Well here's one more. You are enough Brooke. And if I just get you to quit lying, I think i'm gonna like the real you. But shhhh, don't tell anyone. It's a secret.\nRachel: What time is it? It feels like we've been in here for ever.\nBevin: Well, that's because you're wasted. I don't suppose you wanna tell me a secret and actually participate.\nRachel: I'll tell you a secret, not because of class, just because. I never really felt anything with the guys I slept with. When I got my new body I thought it would change everything. Maybe it did for the boys, but not for me.\nBevin: You know, I always wanted to know what it was like to be a dude, like walking through the halls in jeans and a [...] tee shirt or bad ass, you know, talking smack and checking out checks and stuff.\nRachel: Checking out checks. Maybe that's my problem. Maybe I'm into girls. What the hell are you doing?\nBevin: Did you feel anything?\nRachel: No!\nBevin: Then you're not into girls! Trust me Rachel, I'm a really good kisser, and you'd totally be into me right now.\nSkills: It's my shcolarship offer, or not, I mean, I haven't had the courage to open it yet.\nHaley: Skills, you can't keep this secret. Come on I've got a really good feeling about it open it!\nSkills: Ok just give me a few minutes though.\nHaley: Ok.\nSkills: Won't you tell me your secret? Now we talk.\nHaley: Sometimes I feel incredibly disconnected, really uncomfortable in my own skin. Kind of, like I don't fit in to this wolrd. Like I was born at the wrong time, and I don't belong. I just think about my son, and it scares me because I don't ever want him to feel like he doesn't belong. I don't know if my heart could bear that.\nSkills: Nah, he'll belong. The kid's gonna rock this place.\nHaley: You think so?\nSkills: Oh yeah I do. Cause his mom got his back, and if she don't, I do, I promise.\nGlenda: Ok. Here.\nLucas: You're on the pill.\nGlenda: No I'm not on the pill.\nLucas: You have the pill, but you're not on it, that's very secretive.\nGlenda: When my mom was in high school, she was one of the Pretty and Popular. And I think her greatest dispointment is that I'm not! Sometimes she teases me about it, and not in a fun way like, like why can't I loose some weight, and how I'll never get a boyfriend.\nLucas: That sucks.\nGlenda: Yeah. Anyway, one day I got some flowers from my boyfriend.\nLucas: So you have a boyfriend.\nGlenda: No, I made him up, and I sent the flowers to myself. He was pretty awesome though he sent me all kinds of things.\nLucas: Your imaginary boyfriend.\nGlenda: Anyway, I told my mom we were getting serious, and that maybe I should go on the pill. And in my head I thought it would be this binding experience like, she'd secretly be happy for me, sit me down and coucil me about being safe or just tell me to wait or ... just be my mom. Instead she took me to the doctor, got me the pill, when we left the pharmacy she hanged me the prescription and she said 'I don't know who'd sleep with you but here you are!'\nLucas: I'm sorry Glenda.\nGlenda: It's ok. So I looked at her and I said 'I don't know who'd sleep with you either but here I am!'. And we haven't spoken since, not a word.\nLucas: How long has it been?\nGlenda: Like 8 weeks. She just drives me off to school and picks me up, and we just don't talk. There's just silence, silence and disappointment.\nNathan: My mom tried to kill herself.\nPeyton: What?\nNathan: She sucked a bunch of pills. I haven't told anybody. Just Haley.\nPeyton: Nathan I'm so sorry.\nNathan: The worst point about it is when I found out that she might die, there's a moment, there's just a fraction of a second, when I actually, I felt relieved, like maybe it was for the best. You believe that? A kid actually feeling relieved at the thought of loosing his mother? What kind of person does that make me, Peyton, that I can feel that?\nPeyton: I can't whistle. Nothing.\nNathan: That's terrible! How can you not whistle?\nPeyton: I know okay I'm pathetic.\nShelly: I've got a pair of leather pants in my locker that I'd be dying to wear!\nMouth: Nice. You should totally rock those.\nShelly: I can't. I'm a Clean Teen. Doesn't exactly fit the image.\nMouth: Then change the image.\nShelly: Mouth before I, took back my virginity, I was kind of... friendly. It just figures, everyone saw me as a slut, and now I am this radical virgin who can't wear a pair of leather pants. Sometimes I just wish they'd see me as a girl, you know, just a girl, nice, cool sometimes, [...].\nMouth: Beautiful.\nShelly: So, how do you know about all this media stuff?\nMouth: Oh, hum, me and Jimmy...\nShelly: Jimmy Edwards?\nMouth: He was my friend. I miss him a lot. I have to keep it secret because he killed Lucas' uncle Keith and I loved Keith. But, it doesn't mean I don't miss my friend you know, especially with graduation coming up.\nShelly: Sorry. I never told you what I'm afraid of, second question on the list. I'm kind of afraid of being here with you.\nMouth: Why?\nShelly: Because I'm a Clean Teen, and your hot.\nBrooke: I'm sorry I lied Chase. It's just you're a Clean Teen, and you're hot, and...\nMouth: You were serious about me being decent looking or, are you just trying to make up for the geek comment?\nChase: I didn't say decent looking. I said hot. Mouth, I'm a Clean Teen.\nMouth: So what?\nGlenda: So I've been thinking about your manuscript. You need to give it to someone who won't go easy with you, someone who's gonna tell you the truth...\nLucas: Someone like you?\nGlenda: I haven't actually been that truthful, I mean not about school. The truth is I'm gonna miss this place. And it's all my fault. I just wish I would have tried harder, and I just didn't wanna look like an idiot.\nLucas: I think everybody feels that way sometimes. You know like people don't see them for who they really are. It's not just you.\nGlenda: You would have made a great goth you know? A little tortured, a bit of a loaner, but kind. Hey, I have an idea for your picture.\nRachel: Thank God, this ridiculous class is almost over.\nBevin: I liked it.\nRachel: That's because you're too blisfully stupid to resist.\nBevin: I know poeple think I'm stupid. But I'm not dumb. I just let you and the other girls have your way because how you need it to be. But I think Carl's right. Pretty soon we're all gonna graduate and, I can start over. But it'll be harder for the people who need this place to make themselves so special. People who use highschool to build themselves up and then find out that the real world doesn't care so much about who you were in high school, people like you. Ok, so, what are we gonna do for our pictures?\nMouth: You need to go get those leather pants.\nShelly: What?\nMouth: For the picture. Also, your need to take off your shirt.\nShelly: Wait what?\nPeyton: Take off your shirt?\nNathan: Wow, just like the old days.\nPeyton: Stop it, I have an idea for your picture, but before you do that, come here. Look the bell is gonna ring soon and I don't know if I'm gonna have the chance to say it so, I'm gonna say it now. You're doing great Nathan. Alright? Just please, put yourself first sometimes. Well now let's see the marchandise!\nNathan: Ohhh, fun.\nPeyton: Let's go, chop, chop, baby!\nSkills: I want you to open it. Tell me, if it's the factory or college?\nHaley: Okay, but I want you to know that no matter what this letter says you're gonna find your way to some great things. I know it.\nSkills: Yeah well if it all means the same, I'd rather find my great things to college.\nHaley: Well, it looks like you'll be going into that factory, and you're gonna tell your father that you just got a full ride to college.\nSkills: Girl, that's messed up! I almost doomed my ass off this damn roof!\nHaley: Ohhh sorry!\nBrooke: So, how about it? You think one class can change your life?\nChase: The way you kiss? Definitely. You still think you're not good enough?\nBrooke: I don't think that ever goes away, but I think you just have to learn to deal with it, you know, learn to use it.\nChase: So let's use it then!\nChase: Today I spent an hour with Brooke Davis, and I learnt something. People are all gonna label you. But it's how you overcome those labels. Thats' what matters.\nBrooke: I spent an hour with Chase Adams. He's a Clean Teen, and that's pretty cool!\nPeyton: People think they know Nathan Scott. I know I did. But, I discovered something new today. Nathan Scott is a martyr. He's also gonna be a terrific father.\nNathan: I spent the class with Peyton Sawyer. It reminded me what a good friend she is. I also learnt that considering recent history, she's not quite ready for the whole picture thing.\nMouth: Some of you have met Shelly Simon, Clean Teen, but today, I got to know Shelly Simon, teen. I also asked her to prom.\nShelly: An hour ago I called Marvin Mc Fadden nice. He is. But I should have called him dangerous. I also said yes to prom.\nRachel: This is one of the best classes I've ever had. A kick-ass fifty minutes during which Bevin told me she always wanted to be a guy.\nBevin: I spent the hour with Rachel, and I think she learnt today that I am not an idiot. This is my picture of her.\nSkills: Over the years I've known Haley James book warm, Haley James sarcastic girl, Haley James Scott rock star and Haley James Scott mother to be. Today I got reaquainted with just Haley, my girl friend. She get heavier too!\nHaley: Skills has been my friend since really young, and today I remembered why, he's a great listener, he's gonna do awesome in college, and he deserves to be on top of the world.\nGlenda: Fifty minutes ago, I called Lucas Scott a jock. But I was wrong, he's more than one simple word, I guess we all are. Anyway I learnt that Lucas is actually a lot like me. Who knew?\nLucas: I wish I would have hung out with Glenda before today.

        "prompt_0": "In the Mayor's office. Faith is sitting at the desk with her eyes closed. A present is laying on the desk in front of her. The Mayor stands by her side.\nMayor: Alright, you can open them up now. Faith sees the present and smiles up at him.\nFaith: Fab. What's the occasion?\nMayor: Faith! As if I need a reason to show you my affection. Or appreciation for running a small errand at the airport.\nFaith: Airport? What's next? Gonna want me to help a buddy of yours move a sofa?\nMayor: This isn't a free ride, young lady. You know, I'm beginning to think that somebody's getting a little spoiled. Maybe I should take this back.\nFaith: (clutches the present) Sorry... Sir.\nMayor: That's my girl. (chuckles) Another cookie? (Faith takes one) Now. A package is arriving tomorrow night from Central America. Something, and I can't stress this enough, something crucially important to my Ascension. Without it ... Well! What would Toll House cookies be without the chocolate chips? A pretty darn big disappointment, I can tell you. (giggles) Open your present. (she does) There. That look on your face is my reward. The present is a knife with an intricate design.\nFaith: This is a thing of beauty, boss.\nMayor: Well, it cost a pretty penny. So, you just take good care of it. And you be careful not to put somebody's eye out with that thing, until I tell you to.\nFaith: Any particular eyes in mind?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNight, in a graveyard. Angel and Buffy are fighting a pair of vampires. Buffy trips her opponent into Angel's legs.\nBuffy: Sorry, honey!\nAngel: That's okay. They finish off both vampires.\nBuffy: Well, there's something you don't see every day. Unless, of course, you're me.\nAngel: That was bracing. Want to do another sweep?\nBuffy: It's what I live for. Sad to say.\nAngel: You too tired?\nBuffy: No. It's just... Do you get the feeling that we're kind of in a rut?\nAngel: A rut?\nBuffy: You never take me any place new.\nAngel: What about that fire demon nest in the cave by the beach? I felt that was a nice change of pace.\nBuffy: So this is our future? This is how we're going to spend our nights when I'm fifty and you're ... the same age you are now. They hear a growl offstage.\nAngel: Let's just get you to fifty.\nBuffy: Liking that plan. Opening credits.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the Summers house. Buffy sits at the table, flipping through a book. Joyce enters from the hall.\nJoyce: Buffy? When were you going to tell me?\nBuffy: Alright, busted. I didn't think you'd miss them. (takes off earrings)\nJoyce: You were accepted to Northwestern University. Honey, I'm so proud of you! That's wonderful!\nBuffy: (less enthusiastic) Right! It's wonderful.\nJoyce: I mean, it's not cheap, but, uh, I know we can make it work if your father pitches in. Not that Northwestern is your only option. It's a great school, though. I am so proud of you.\nBuffy: You said that before.\nJoyce: And will again soon.\nBuffy: Mom, you know that I can't ... I-I just can't decide on a school right now. I mean I want to sleep on it, you know, mull it over. Raise them up my inner flagpole, see which one I salute.\nJoyce: I know, sweetheart. I'm just so pleased that you have so many choices. Ooh, you know what? Your aunt Arleen and her family are in Illinois. I've got to call and tell them. Oh, Buffy?\nBuffy: I know, you're proud of me.\nJoyce: Ah, don't forget to put my earrings back in my dresser before you go out. Arleen? Hi! It's Joyce. How you doing? Listen, you are never going to believe where Buffy got accepted to school!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDaylight on campus. One guy sits at a picnic table. A second guy drops a paper bag on the table and sits opposite the first guy.\nGuy #2: Here you go.\nGuy #1: Thanks.\nSnyder: (swoops in) Okay, what's in the bag?\nGuy #1: My lunch.\nSnyder: Is that the new drug lingo? (takes the bag, looks inside)\nGuy #1: No, it's my lunch.\nSnyder: (drops the bag on the table) Sit up straight. (marches off) Camera zooms past Snyder to another table: Willow and Oz sit opposite Buffy.\nWillow: Sounds like your mom's in a state of denial.\nBuffy: More like a continent. She just has to realize that I can't go away.\nWillow: Well, maybe not now, but soon, maybe. Or maybe I too hail from Denial Land.\nBuffy: Faith's turn to the dark side of the Force pretty much put the proverbial kibosh on any away plans for me. UC Sunnydale - at least I got in. You! I mean I can't believe you got into Oxford!\nWillow: It's pretty exciting.\nOz: That's some deep academia there.\nBuffy: That's where they make Gileses.\nWillow: I know! I could learn and, and have scones. Although I-I don't know how I feel about going to school in a foreign country. Xander is sitting at a nearby tree reading Jack Kerouac's _On the Road_.\nXander: Everything in life is foreign territory. Kerouac. He's my teacher. The open road is my school.\nBuffy: Making the open dumpster your cafeteria?\nXander: Go ahead, mock me.\nOz: I think she just did.\nXander: We Bohemian anti-establishment types have always been persecuted.\nOz: Well, sure. You're all so weird.\nWillow: I think it's neat, you doing the backpack, trail mix, happy wanderer thing.\nXander: I'm aware it scores kinda high on the hokey-meter, but I think it will be good for me. You know, help me to find myself. Cordelia walks between the table and Xander's tree.\nCordelia: And help us to lose you. Everyone's a winner.\nXander: (getting up) Well, look who just popped open a fresh can of venom. Hey, did you hear about Willow getting into Oxnard?\nWillow: Oxford.\nXander: Oxford. And M.I.T. and Yale and every other college on the face of the planet. As in your face I rub it.\nCordelia: Oxford? Whoopee! Four years in tea-bag central. Sounds thrilling. And M.I.T. is a Clearasil ad with housing. And Yale is a dumping ground for those who didn't get into Harvard.\nWillow: I got into Harvard.\nXander: Any clue on what college you might be attending so we can start calculating minimum safe distance?\nCordelia: None of your business. Certainly nowhere near you losers!\nBuffy: Okay, you guys, don't forget to breathe between insults.\nCordelia: I'm sorry Buffy. This conversation is reserved for people who actually have a future. (leaves)\nOz: An angry young woman.\nWillow: Oh Buffy, she was just being Cordelia, only more so. Don't pay any attention to her.\nXander: She's definitely got a chip going.\nWillow: Maybe if you didn't goad her so much?\nXander: I can't help it. It's my nature.\nWillow: Maybe you need a better nature.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBuffy and Wesley walk into the library.\nWesley: I don't understand.\nBuffy: Well, I don't think I can talk any slower, Wes. I want to leave.\nWesley: What? Now?\nBuffy: No, not now. After I graduate, you know, college?\nWesley: But, you're a Slayer.\nBuffy: Yeah, I'm also a person. You can't just define me by my Slayer-ness. That's ... something-ism. Giles is listening from the door of his office.\nGiles: Buffy, I know we've talked about you going away...\nBuffy: I got into Northwestern.\nGiles: That's wonderful news. Good for you.\nWesley: Alright, everyone. Monsters, demons, world in peril?\nBuffy: I bet you they have all that stuff in Illinois.\nWesley: You cannot leave Sunnydale. By the power invested in me by the Council, I forbid it. (said while crossing his wrists over his heart - watcher authority hand signal?) Buffy rolls her eyes and turns her back on Wesley.\nGiles: Ah yes, that should settle it.\nWesley: (counting on fingers) Faith gone bad, and the Mayor's Ascension coming up, ...\nBuffy: I know it's complicated. I'm aware that my graduation may be, among other things, posthumous, but... What if I stop the Ascension? What if I capture Faith?\nGiles: I very much hope you will.\nBuffy: If I do that, then all you guys have to do is keep the run of the mill unholy forces at bay through mid-terms and I'll be back in time for Homecoming, and every school break after that. Can we at least think about it?\nWesley: Perhaps if circumstances were different.\nBuffy: I'll make them different.\nWesley: What?\nBuffy: I'm tired of waiting for Mayor McSleaze to make his move while we sit on our hands counting down to Ascension Day. I mean, let's take the fight to him.\nWesley: No. No! Much too reckless. We're at a distinct disadvantage. We don't know anything about the Mayor's Ascension...\nGiles: She's right. Time's running out. We need to take the offensive. (to Buffy) What's your plan?\nBuffy: I gotta have a plan? Really? I can't just be proactive with pep?\nGiles: No. You want to take the fight to them? I suggest the first step would be to find out exactly what they're up to.\nBuffy: Oh. I actually knew that. I thought you meant a more specific plan, you know, like with maps and stuff. Great. We'll find out what they're up to.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNight, at the airport. A small plane taxies to a stop and a man leaves the plane carrying a box. A vampire waits by a limo with a briefcase.\nBox man: Is he in the car?\nVampire: No, I'll take you to him. (opens the limo door) Camera zooms in to show the box handcuffed to the man's right hand. The man kicks the limo door shut.\nBox man: The Mayor was supposed to be here in person with the money. Well, the price just went up. I don't like surprises. Impact sound. The head of an arrow appears through the front of his shirt - Faith has shot him through the back.\nFaith: Surprise. Faith climbs down from her hiding place and approaches the body.\nVampire: You killed him.\nFaith: What are you, the narrator? Keys to the cuffs? The vampire searches the man's clothing.\nVampire: Nothing. Faith pulls out her flashy new knife.\nVampire: That won't cut through steel.\nFaith: No, but it will cut through bone.\nFade to commercial.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNight. The limo pulls up in front of City Hall. Faith carries the box inside. Buffy is watching from the bushes.\nCut to inside the Mayor's office. Faith kicks in the door and carries the box inside.\nMayor: Hey ho! There it is! Hahahaha! Ah, what happened to the courier? I was supposed to pay him.\nFaith: Hunh. Made him an offer he couldn't survive. (takes the money)\nMayor: (chuckles) You are one heck of a girl, you know that? I mean geez, the initiative, the - the skill.\nFaith: Go on, go on. (sits down)\nMayor: I will. You know, I'll tell you, if Buffy ... (Faith props her feet on the desk. The Mayor frowns.) Hey hey hey hey. (Faith drops her feet.) If Buffy Summers walked in here and said she wanted to switch to our side, I'd say (snaps his fingers) no thanks, sister, I've got all the Slayer one man could ever need. (chuckles) Faith sighs.\nMayor: What?\nFaith: Nothing.\nMayor: Oh, it's cause I used the B-word, huh? Don't tell me you're still sore about that whole Angel-Buffy thing.\nFaith: No, I'm over it. She can have him.\nMayor: Better believe she can. She deserves that poor excuse for a creature of the night. You, on the other hand, can do better. Faith is fidgeting and begins toying with the clasp of the box. The Mayor slams his hands down on top of the box.\nMayor: Don't do that.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNight. The limo pulls to a stop in a parking lot. The vampire driver hears a noise and looks back through the rear window. Buffy smashes the driver's side window with her fist and pulls his upper body out of the window.\nBuffy: (peppy) So, what's in the box?\nCut to the library. Buffy sits at the table looking at a book. Xander and Wesley look on.\nBuffy: The Box of Gavrock. It houses some great demonic energy or something which His Honor needs to chow down on come A-Day. Giles and Willow enter. Giles carries some large drawings.\nWesley: What's that?\nGiles: Maps. And stuff.\nWillow: Plans for City Hall. They were in the Water and Power mainframe.\nBuffy: The box is being kept under guard in a conference room on the top floor. (points to a map sheet) There. Unfortunately, that's all I could get out of my informant before his aggressive tendencies forced me to introduce him to Mr. Pointy.\nWesley: Well, now, here's what I think we should do...\nBuffy: I figure we can enter through the skylight. I'll take Angel with me.\nGiles: Agreed.\nXander: And there's a fire ladder on the east side of the building, (points) here.\nWesley: Yes, yes, fine, but we still need to consider whether the Mayor...\nGiles: It won't be enough to simply have possession of the box.\nWillow: Right, we have to destroy it. Not just physically - ritually, with some down and dirty black magic.\nWesley: Hang on. We don't know what such a ritual would require.\nGiles: (flipping through a book) I think the Breath of the Atropyx is standard for this sort of thing. Fairly simple recipe. Xander? Wesley attempts to read over Giles's shoulder but Giles hands the book to Xander.\nXander: I know. I'm ingredient getting guy.\nWesley: Alright, stop! I demand everyone STOP this instant! (everyone looks at him) I'm in charge here and I say this is all moving much too fast. We need time to fully analyze the situation and devise a proper and strategic strategem.\nBuffy: Wes, hop on the train or get off the tracks.\nWesley: The Mayor will most assuredly have supernatural safeguards protecting the box. (silence) Oh, we all forgot about that, did we?\nBuffy: Looks like a job for Wiccan girl. What do you say, Will? Big time danger.\nWillow: Hey, I eat danger for breakfast.\nXander: But oddly enough, she panics in the face of breakfast foods.\nBuffy: Let's get to work. The gang files past Wesley. Giles pushes a map into Wesley's hands. Wesley mopes for a moment, then turns to follow.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDaylight. Xander is walking along a street and pauses at the window of a shop. He sees Cordelia inside holding up a dress. He starts, stops, looks for a moment more. He goes inside.\nXander: I have a theory. Your snide remarks earlier? I'm guessing grapes a little on the sour side. Didn't get into any schools, did you? The grades were there, but ooh, if it weren't for that pesky interview. Ten minutes with you and the Admissions Department decided that they'd already reached their mean-spirited superficial princess quotas.\nCordelia: And once again, the gold medal in the Being Wrong event goes to Xander \"I'm as stupid as I look\" Harris. (takes envelopes from her purse) Read 'em and weep, creep. USC, Colorado State, Duke, and Columbia.\nXander: Wow! These are great colleges. I'm guessing they must have seen a different side of your father's money.\nCordelia: (snatches the letters away from him) Go away.\nXander: Sure! If you'll excuse me, I have to go back to helping to save some lives. Carry on. I know that you have some important accessorizing to do. Xander leaves. Cordelia looks unhappy.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNight. A dark van stops in a parking lot. Wesley is driving, Giles rides shotgun. Buffy, Angel, and Willow get out.\nGiles: Now remember, if anything should go awry, Wesley and I will create a diversion.\nWesley: Let's synchronize our watches. I have twenty-one four... Buffy and Willow are holding up their bare wrists.\nWesley: Yes, typical.\nWillow: Maybe we could just count. One one thousand, two one thousand, ...\nGiles: Be careful, all of you. The trio marches off. Giles turns to Wesley.\nGiles: Tea? Angel pulls down the fire ladder. Willow starts climbing.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the library. Oz places a large ceramic pot on a pedestal. Xander enters carrying a paper bag.\nOz: You got the goods?\nXander: Yeah. (starts pulling plastic baggies out) Essence of toad, twice-blessed sage, maybe that's the toad?\nOz: Well, we better be sure. Destroying this box is supposed to be a pretty delicate operation.\nXander: Well, then, they shouldn't leave it in the hands of the lay people.\nOz: Oh, Willow laid it out for us pretty well. (shows him Willow's papers)\nXander: Wow! She even drew helpful diagrams. That's the pedestal.\nOz: And the ingredients. And us. See, there's you and there's me.\nXander: Well, how can you tell which is which? I mean, they both look kinda stick-figurey to me.\nOz: Well, this one's me. See the little guitar.\nXander: Oh, gotcha.\nOz: Nobody like my Willow.\nXander: No sir, there is not. Oz moves to the pot and drops three gold pieces in.\nOz: Okay, toad me. Xander throws him a plastic bag.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNight, on the roof of City Hall. The trio can see the box through the skylight. Angel opens the skylight. Buffy hands Willow a book and a bottle containing salt or sand. Willow reads a spell (in Latin?) while pouring the sand over the box. As the sand falls, a blue force field appears around the box, then suddenly disappears.\nWillow: (big smile) Oh yeah, I'm bad.\nBuffy: Four stars, Will. Now get going.\nWillow: I'm gone. Willow leaves by the fire ladder. Angel fits Buffy with a harness and sets up a pully system. He lowers her down over the box (like the Mission Impossible movie)\nBuffy: Got it! As she lifts the box off the table, an alarm bell rings. Angel is pulling on the cord, but Buffy doesn't move.\nBuffy: Angel!\nAngel: It's jammed.\nBuffy: I'd like very much to come up now, please. Angel!\nAngel: I know! Two vampires enter the room with a growl.\nBuffy: Don't suppose you want to help me get down. (they growl) Didn't think so. Angel leaps down to the table. They fight. Buffy gets in a neat kick using a vertical spin in the trapeze harness, then gets out of it. Buffy and Angel escape the room with the vampire guards in pursuit. Cut to outside. Buffy and Angel run out of the building and dart right. As the vampires leave the building, the black van accelerates past the door and the vampires chase it. Buffy and Angel stand up and watch from their hiding place in the bushes, then run the other way.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the wrecked conference room. The Mayor surveys the damage while the vampire guards stand with their heads down.\nMayor: Well, this is very unfortunate. I just had this conference room redecorated, for Pete's sake. At taxpayers' expense. And, oh yeah ... (the cheerful facade breaks and with a burst of rage, he smashes a chair) They've got my box. Faith walks in, holding a knife to Willow's neck.\nFaith: Yeah they do, but looky what we got. Big smile from the Mayor.\nFade to commercial.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the library. Scooby Gang minus Willow.\nBuffy: How did you guys let ... How did this happen?\nGiles: We thought she stayed with you.\nAngel: They must have grabbed her when she hit the ground. Buffy, I'm sorry.\nBuffy: Look, it's nobody's fault, okay. We just need to focus and deal. Oz, I swear I won't let them hurt her.\nXander: We go back. Full-on assault.\nGiles: They'll kill her.\nWesley: We're assuming they haven't already.\nBuffy: No. No, they know what she means to us. She's too valuable as long as we still have the box. We trade.\nWesley: We can't.\nBuffy: No, it's the safest plan. (to Giles) It's the only way, right?\nGiles: It might well be.\nBuffy: Look, we call the Mayor and arrange a meeting.\nWesley: This box must be destroyed.\nXander: I need a volunteer to hit Wesley.\nWesley: Giles, you know I'm right about this.\nBuffy: Wes, you want to duck and cover at this point?\nWesley: Damn it, you listen to me! This box is the key to the Mayor's Ascension. Thousands of lives depend on our getting rid of it. Now I want to help Willow as much as the rest of you, but we will find another way.\nBuffy: There is no other way.\nWesley: You're the one who said take the fight to the Mayor. You were right. This is the town's best hope of survival. It's your chance to get out.\nBuffy: You think I care about that? Are you made of human parts?\nGiles: Alright! Let's deal with this rationally.\nBuffy: Why are you taking his side? The outbursts of Buffy, Giles, and Wesley clash for a moment, then Wesley's voice breaks out of the babble.\nWesley: You'd sacrifice thousands of lives? Your families, your friends? Oz has been sitting through all this. He gets up and walks behind Wesley.\nWesley: It can all end right here. We have the means to destroy this box. Oz picks up the pot for the box-destroying ritual and throws it into a display case, smashing both to shards. Everyone looks at each other.\nBuffy: Giles, make the phone call.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn City Hall, in a musty storeroom. Willow is banging on a locked window, trying to open it. She gives up on the window and pulls out a desk drawer, making a lot of noise. A vampire guard enters the room.\nGuard: What are you doing?\nWillow: Oh, uh, I'm looking for a sucking candy, cause my mouth gets dry when I'm nervous, or held prisoner against my will. The vampire slowly approaches her with a hungry look.\nWillow: And suddenly I'm thinking sucking isn't a good word to use around vampires. Hey! Did you get permission to eat the hostage? I don't think so. You're going to be in some trouble when the Mayor ...Ow! The vampire grabs her shoulders and presses her against a wall.\nGuard: Just a little taste. As he leans in for the bite, a pencil from the desk drawer floats up behind him and stabs him in the back. He crumbles to dust. Willow leaves the room and starts down a hallway. A door opens and she hears Faith and the Mayor. Willow quickly hides in another room and listens as they pass.\nFaith: She's not gonna be brain-dead but she'd be to come back here tonight.\nMayor: Ever had a dog?\nFaith: What?\nMayor: I did. Rusty. Irish setter. A dog's friendship is stronger than reason, stronger than it's own sense of self-preservation. Buffy's like a dog, and hey, before you can say Jack Robinson, you'll get to see me kill her like one. Faith and the Mayor walk down the hall. Willow starts to run the other way, but stops at the open door to the Mayor's office. She enters, closes the door, and finds the Mayor's cupboard of skulls and magic stuff. She finds a hidden compartment containing the Books of Ascension, and begins skimming the pages.\nFaith: Check out the bookworm. (standing in the office door)\nWillow: Faith!\nFaith: Anyone with brains, anyone who knew what was going to happen to her, would try to claw her way out of this place. But you, you just can't stop Nancy Drew-ing, can you? Guess now you know too much and that kinda just naturally leads to killing.\nWillow: Faith, wait. I want to talk to you.\nFaith: Oh yeah? Give me the speech again, please. Faith, we're still your friends. We can help you. It's not too late.\nWillow: It's way too late. You know, it didn't have to be this way. But you made your choice. I know you had a tough life. I know that some people think you had a lot of bad breaks. Well, boo hoo! Poor you. You know, you had a lot more in your life than some people. I mean, you had friends in your life like Buffy. Now you have no one. You were a Slayer and now you're nothing. You're just a big selfish, worthless waste. Faith punches Willow in the jaw and she falls to the ground.\nFaith: You hurt me, I hurt you. I'm just a little more efficient. Willow climbs back to her feet.\nWillow: Aw, here I just thought you didn't have a come-back.\nFaith: You're begging for some deep pain.\nWillow: I'm not afraid of you. Faith pulls out the fancy knife.\nFaith: Let's see what we can do about that. The Mayor is standing in the doorway.\nMayor: Girls, I hope I don't have to separate you two. Faith, you can play with your new toy later. Something's come up. Faith keeps holding the knife to Willow's neck, staring into her eyes.\nMayor: Faith! You know I don't like repeating myself.\nFaith: (to Willow) I got someone. I got him.\nMayor: I just received a heck of an interesting phone call.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNight. In the Sunnydale High cafeteria. The Scooby Gang waits for the Mayor. Giles holds a baseball bat. Oz tests a locked door.\nOz: The whole place is locked down, except for the front.\nXander: Yeah, it gives me that comforting trapped feeling.\nBuffy: One way out means one way in. I want to see them coming. The lights go out, leaving the room dimly lit by outside lights.\nXander: Guess they're shy.\nAngel: I can see alright. The two vampire guards push open the front doors, followed by the Mayor, then Faith holding Willow. The two groups stop and glare at each other. The Mayor and Buffy advance to within arm's reach.\nMayor: Well, this is exciting, isn't it? (chuckles) Clandestine meetings by dark of night. Exchange of prisoners. I just, I, I feel like we should all be wearing trench coats.\nBuffy: Let her go.\nMayor: No. Not until the box is in my hands. So you're the little girl that's been causing me all this trouble. She's pretty, Angel. A little skinny. Still don't understand why it couldn't work out with you and my Faith. Guess you kind of just have strange taste in women.\nAngel: Well, what can I say? I like them sane. Willow makes a sound as Faith tightens her grip.\nOz: Angel.\nMayor: Well, I wish you kids the best, I really do. But if you don't mind a bit of fatherly advice, I, uh, I-I just don't see much of a future for you two. I don't sense a lasting relationship. And not just because I plan to kill you. You two have a bumpy road ahead.\nBuffy: I don't think we need to talk about this.\nMayor: God, you kids, you know. You don't like to think about the future. You don't like to make plans. Unless you want Faith to gut your friend like a sea bass, show a little respect for your elders.\nAngel: You're not my elder. I've got a lotta years on you.\nMayor: Yeah, and that's just one of the things you're going to have to deal with. You're immortal, she's not. It's not. I married my Edna May in ought-three and I was with her right until the end. Not a pretty picture. Wrinkled and senile and cursing me for my youth. Wasn't our happiest time. And let's not forget the fact that any moment of true happiness will turn you evil. I mean, come on. What kind of a life can you offer her? I don't see a lot of Sunday picnics in the offing. I see skulking in the shadows, hiding from the sun. She's a blossoming young girl and you want to keep her from the life she should have until it has passed her by. My God! I think that's a little selfish. Is that what you came back from Hell for? Is that your greater purpose? (he stares at Angel for a moment and then shakes his head in disgust) Make the trade. Angel and Faith trade. Faith is holding the box in the center of the room.\nMayor: Well, that went smooth. Snyder and two policemen enter the front door.\nSnyder: Nobody moves! The Mayor steps back into the shadows as Snyder advances. One policeman locks the doors behind him.\nSnyder: I knew you kids were up to something.\nBuffy: Snyder, get out of here.\nSnyder: You're not giving orders, young lady. I suppose you're going to tell me I won't find drugs in this box. Snyder takes the box from Faith and turns away. Faith pulls her knife.\nBuffy: (to Faith) Wait!\nMayor: Principal Snyder. Snyder turns at the Mayor's voice, then focuses on the drawn knife.\nMayor: I think we have a problem.\nSnyder: Mr. Mayor, I had no idea you ... I'm terribly sorry.\nMayor: No, it's I who should apologize. Coming down here at night. What must you be thinking? But you see, I just needed to ... Behind Snyder, one of the policemen is opening the box.\nMayor: No! Don't do that! A spidery creature leaps out of the box onto the policeman's face. (much like the face-hugger in the Aliens movies) He starts screaming.\nFade to commercial.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe policeman attempts to pull the spider off his face, but cannot. He collapses to the floor and stops moving. The spider releases him and skitters away into the shadows. The whole thing happened so quickly, no one moved to interfere. The Scooby Gang starts shifting positions, looking for the creature.\nWesley: Oh god.\nXander: Where did it go?\nSnyder: (to the remaining cop) Get that door open!\nGiles: No! You can't let that thing out of here! The policeman fumbles nervously with his keys and drops them.\nXander: I still want to know where it went.\nBuffy: Listen. They hear subtle noises on the ceiling: skittering feet, a low keening. Everyone looks up. The spider drops onto the Mayor's face and he falls backwards onto a table.\nFaith: Boss! Faith rushes to his aid. She pulls the spider off and flings it into a wall. It rights itself and skitters out of sight. Giles and Wesley climb up on chairs. While everyone is looking at the Mayor, a second spider creeps out of the box. The Mayor sits up with wounds on his face which rapidly fade away. Snyder stares in horror at the Mayor's face.\nMayor: Wouldn't leave that open. Buffy slams the lid of the box shut just as a third creature is climbing out. Severed limbs clatter on the floor. As she is crouched at the box, one of the spiders drops on her back. She flips onto her back, crushing it against the floor. Faith sees the second spider climbing the wall behind Wesley and draws back her arm. Wesley sees her.\nWesley: No! Wesley ducks. Faith snaps the knife into the spider, killing it. The Mayor strides over the box and picks it up.\nOz: Is that all of them?\nMayor: Ah, not really. You see, there's about fifty... billion of these happy little critters in here. Would you like to see? The cop finally gets the front doors open. He and the two vampire guards race out of the room.\nMayor: Raise your hand if you're invulnerable. (no replies) Faith, let's go. Faith stares at the impaled spider on the wall.\nMayor: Faith. Faith stares a moment more, then follows him. Snyder is holding a chair at chest height, legs pointed outward. He turns as Faith walks by, keeping the chair between them.\nBuffy: Snyder, you alive in there?\nSnyder: You. All of you. Why couldn't you be dealing drugs like normal people? Snyder walks out cautiously, still holding his chair like a security blanket.\nWesley: Well, that went swimmingly.\nBuffy: We did alright. (Buffy and Willow share a look.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the library. Buffy and Willow sit cross-legged on the counter. Willow is very animated. Giles and Wesley stand back.\nWillow: So Faith was like I'm going to beat you up and I'm all \"I'm not afraid of you\" and then she had the knife which was less fun a-and then, oh! I-I told her you made your choice, Buffy was your friend...\nGiles: This is fascinating, but let's get back to the point. You actually had your hands on the Books of Ascension?\nWillow: Volumes One through Five.\nGiles: Is there anything you can remember that could be of use to us? Anything at all?\nWillow: Well, I was in a hurry, and what I did read was kind of over-involved. If you ask me, way over-written. Actually, there were a few pages that looked kind of interesting but I didn't have a chance to read them fully. Giles looks disheartened. Willow pulls some folded pages out of a pocket.\nWillow: See what you can make of them? Giles smiles like a kid at Christmas and rushes off.\nBuffy: This is your night for suave, Will. You should get captured more often.\nWillow: No, thank you.\nWesley: Well, let's hope there is something useful in those pages. The Mayor has the Box of Gavrock. As of now, we are right back where we started. Wouldn't you say? Buffy looks unhappy.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDaylight on campus. Buffy is crouched, leaning back against a tree. Willow walks up.\nWillow: Deep thoughts?\nBuffy: Deep and meaningful.\nWillow: As in?\nBuffy: As in, I'm never getting out of here. I kept thinking if I stopped the Mayor or ... but I was kidding myself. I mean, there is always going to be something. I'm a Sunnydale girl, no other choice.\nWillow: Must be tough. I mean, here I am, I can do anything I want. I can go to any college in the country, four or five in Europe if Iwant.\nBuffy: Please tell me you're going somewhere with this?\nWillow: No. (hands Buffy a letter) I'm not going anywhere.\nBuffy: UC Sunnydale?\nWillow: I will be matriculating with Class of 2003.\nBuffy: Are you serious?\nWillow: Say, isn't that where you're going? Buffy hugs her and they tumble onto the ground.\nBuffy: I can't believe it! Are you serious? Ah, wait, what am I saying? You can't.\nWillow: What do you mean, I can't?\nBuffy: I won't let you.\nWillow: Of the two people here, which is the boss of me?\nBuffy: There are better schools.\nWillow: Sunnydale's not bad. A-And I can design my own curriculum.\nBuffy: Okay, well, there are safer schools. There are safer prisons. I can't let you stay because of me.\nWillow: Actually, this isn't about you. Although I'm fond, don't get me wrong, of you. The other night, you know, being captured and all, facing off with Faith. Things just, kind of, got clear. I mean, you've been fighting evil here for three years, and I've helped some, and now we're supposed to decide what we want to do with our lives. And I just realized that that's what I want to do. Fight evil, help people. I mean, I-I think it's worth doing. And I don't think you do it because you have to. It's a good fight, Buffy, and I want in.\nBuffy: I kind of love you.\nWillow: And, besides, I have a shot at being a bad ass Wiccan, and what better place to learn?\nBuffy: I feel the need for more sugar than the human body can handle.\nWillow: Mochas?\nBuffy: Yes, please. It's weird. You look at something and you think you know exactly what you're seeing, and then you find out it's something else entirely.\nWillow: Neat, huh?\nBuffy: Sometimes it is.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the dress shop where Xander and Cordelia last fought. Cordelia is holding a dress in front of her, looking in a full-length mirror. A woman in a suit enters the room behind her.\nWoman: Chase! What are you doing? Your break's been over for ten minutes. I still need you to re-stock the shelves and clean out the storage room. Let's go. Cordelia looks at the dress for a few seconds more, then goes back to work.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNight, in a graveyard. Buffy and Angel are holding hands, sitting on a blanket, leaning against a gravestone.\nBuffy: It's gonna be fun. Will and I are going to go on Saturday to check out the campus. I'm hoping Mom will let me live there. It's too far to come home every night. Plus the whole lack of cool factor. Either way, I'll be close to your place. I don't know what the Mayor was talking about. How could he know anything about us?\nAngel: Well, he's evil.\nBuffy: Big time. He doesn't even know what a lasting relationship is.\nAngel: No.\nBuffy: Probably the only lasting relationship he's ever had is with evil.\nAngel: Yeah.\nBuffy: Big, stupid, evil guy. We'll be okay.\nAngel: We will. Buffy leans her head against Angel's chest, looking not very okay.\nBLACK OUT\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

        "prompt_0": "Since you're in beach buggies, you will now drive to the beach at the northernmost point of Namibia, where it meets Angola. It's 1.000 miles away.\nRichard: We have got to find this road. This is not gonna be too clever in the dark. Listen. I shall find the Southern Cross.\nRichard: Oh, this is a bad idea! We are now trusting our lives to an orangutang who thinks he's Patrick Moore.\nJames: 24 hours of cold, misery, to achieve exactly nothing. I mean, it is exactly nothing.\nRichard: Oh, it's coming in!\n(JEREMY YELLS)\nThis is the best desert I've ever been to. Holy sh1t!\nRichard: Oh!\n(YELLS)\nJeremy: What it actually is is a big, orange killing engine.\nJesus!\n(LAUGHS)\nRichard: (LAUGHS) Oh, my God!\nPlease make it! Please! Just need to find a road now. This is not funny any more. I don't want another night in the desert. Oh, my God. I could go east, I could go west.\nRichard: Whichever way you go, it goes somewhere. Yes! It is the road to freedom.\n(THUD)\nWhat the hell was that? What I'm driving here, or attempting to drive, is Apollo 13.\nJeremy: It was morning by the time I nursed my wounded car into Windhoek, and my well-rested colleagues were full of admiration for how I'd pulled off such a feat. Is that the first thing you thought of? What? Tear a hole in it. What's that gonna do? I needed to get to the bleed valve on the radiator, which is there. Is it? And, to make life doubly difficult... I trod on my spectacles.\n(RICHARD LAUGHS)\nThat is tragic, trying to fix it with one lens. I was trying to fix it. And the only eye I can close is this eye. You can't close your left eye? I can't close my left eye. Why didn't you put them on upside down? You'd have the lens over the other eye. That is logic there. Oh, yeah.\n(LAUGHS)\nCome on, let's go. We've got a lot to do.\nJeremy: No! The one thing we have established now is that, with the exception of Windhoek, which is the capital, Namibia is a tough and arduous place. Yeah. Have you bought maps? No. Have you got tenting equipment of any sort? Have you got somewhere to sleep other than the desert floor? No. So why don't we, today, get prepared for the next leg of the - big leg of the journey? That is a good idea. We'll do that. That's not a bad idea. We'll grant ourselves a day of... shopping. Mm. First of all, would you permit me to chisel some of the cheddar that has grown in my underpants away? Well, not here.\nJeremy: Having de-cheesed my body parts, we headed out to get the necessary supplies.\nRichard: The thing is, if we go mesh, it'll keep the sun off but it won't keep the light out. That will wake us up early. That's 1.5 kilograms. But- Hammond, the first thing you need to know before we start shopping in here is James and I are in charge.\nRichard: Well...\nJames: Sorry, he's right. No, you're not. You don't know anything about camping.\nJames, Jeremy: Exactly. How does that make you in charge? Because we know it's all terrible. If we leave it to you, we'll all end up sleeping in small green triangles. The camping you know about is in the Lake District, where you deliberately make yourself miserable. I'm sorry, he's right. It is possible, I think, with a bit of ingenuity and money, to make tenting bearable.\nJeremy: Richard Baden-Hammond disagreed, so we went our separate ways. Correct, incorrect. Exactly. Do you agree? But I'd go even more correct. Oh, yes! Perfect. Roll it out on the desert floor... you're home. Oh, James! Le Creuset! See, Hammond would hate this, because this weighs more than a tent. Which it does, actually. A lot more. And it weighs more because it is a quality item. Exactly. Pocket trowel. Pocket soap. Here we go. Pasta spoon. Yeah, good idea. I find that bottle opener a bit... lightweight. Yeah, more expensive is what we're looking for. You see, look at this, James. This is the sort of thing Hammond would think is a chair. Ooh! That's all you need. That's your whole... stove. That's it. Is it gas? It is, isn't it? I presume so. For two, you could get a small chicken in there, or... a pheasant. We're getting there now. So that folds down to that. Yeah.\nJeremy: The next morning, we headed out once more, with the camping gear James and I had bought bringing up the rear. And besides stocking up with essentials, Hammond and I had used our day off in Windhoek to modify our cars. To solve my overheating problems, I've fitted a ram-air scoop, which shovels refreshing, cooling air into the radiator as I go along. And, as you may have noticed, I've fitted a spoiler. My only complaint, really, about my beach buggy was its lack of performance in third and fourth gears. Couldn't up power from the engine and I don't want to stress it, so I could lighten it. I've stripped away the superstructure here and the passenger seat, anything spare. That means this car is 30-40 kilos lighter than it was before. Jeremy, why has your car sprouted a green moustache?\nJeremy: Well, it's a spoiler for added downforce at the front end, which you need in a rear-engine vehicle. This thing will be unbelievable through the corners now, it really will. Like a 911. And I tell you what, even with your new lightweight buggy, you're no match for what I've got here this morning. Yeah, I'm sorry, mate. This is quicker. It is not. It is. Right, Richard Hammond, I challenge you to a race. OK, you're on. Idiot.\nJeremy: We shall find a race track and we shall do racing. Well, you carry on. I'm not doing any racing. That's utterly pointless.\nJeremy: On the outskirts of the city, we found a rather excellent circuit where we could do timed laps, and James could try out his new vacuum cleaner.\n(VACUUM WHIRS)\nJames: Oh, yes.\nAre you ready? No. Why not? Temperatures and pressures. This is a racing machine. Look at it. It's a plastic beach buggy parked near a V8. With aero. Really? In...\n(REVVING)\n...three, two, one, go!\n(REVVING STOPS)\nYeah, I'm gonna do it in gear. Give it a shot. I'm gonna try that. In- No! Throttle's jammed. Yes. (STAMMERS) Jammed. In- No! You can keep saying \"in\" till the cows come home. The throttle...\n(VACUUMING, JAMES HUMS TUNES)\n(REVVING)\nThree, two, one, begin!\n(BOTH YELL)\nWhy... Why have you stopped? Ah. Well, erm...\n(ENGINE STOPS)\nThe throttle may have gone a bit open.\n(IGNITION FAILS)\nYeah. My throttle is totally broken. Anyway, Hammond... Yeah? Any car which can wheelie off the line... is going to be able to beat yours, and would have done. So... Sorry. You're saying because your car started, well, 50 yards away over there, wheelied, was uncontrollable, slammed back down and broke itself, it's the best on the track?\nJeremy: Yes. Well, much learned. Really useful. Glad we did it.\nRichard: With Jeremy's endlessly troublesome car fixed again, we scooped up James' Dyson and continued northwards towards the finish line at the border with Angola. The going was smooth and easy and eerily quiet, which begged a question. Now, apparently, Namibia is the most dangerous place in the world to drive. There are more accidents per head then anywhere else, and car accidents are the first and most common cause of death in young adults. How? How can that be so? I mean... the place is empty. In Britain, there are 250-260 people for every square kilometre. Here... it's two. Two! This makes the Australian outback look like Monaco. Monkey! Monkey! Huge anus! Did you see that thing's anus?\nJames: I, however, was not thinking about population statistics or monkeys' bottoms. I was just happy to be on a smooth surface in a car that wasn't filled with dust. I shall relax... with the lovely view. Sadly, though, a few miles later...\n(RATTLING)\nOw! Ow! Oh, my nuts! Ow!\n(GROANS)\nStop it! Ow! Ow! Agh! James May? Yes, I can hear you, but it's very uncomfortable and my car has... has cut out.\nJames: Ow!\nJeremy: Mercifully for James, we eventually arrived at a game reserve, which we decided would be an ideal place to set up camp for the night.\n(UNZIPPING)\nRichard: Right.\n(CHUCKLES)\nThat's what we need.\nJeremy: As Hammond built his canvas hovel... James and I were looking forward to a more civilised evening in the tents we'd bought, and which had been erected by the butler we'd also bought.\nJames: Thank you, Giovanni. Tuck your shirt in, man! It's not a bloody caravan site. Erm... I'm just thinking, dinner. Mm. Do you mind if I get changed? No, exactly. I'm gonna have a shower. Mm. Or I may have a bath, actually. Why not? Giovanni, could you run the baths?\nJeremy: Apparently, this place has got oysters. Really? Here? Yeah. I know, it's extraordinary. Who knew? Are you coming for some dinner?\nRichard: What do you mean, \"Coming for dinner\"? I'm cooking here. There's a restaurant just down there. A restaurant? Yeah, just down there. I don't want to go. I'm cooking this. I'm doing it properly, camping. Well, come and- I'll join you after dinner.\nJeremy: Whatever.\nJames: He's such a peasant, isn't he?\nJeremy: It's just unbelievable.\n(METALLIC CLANGING)\nJeremy: That evening in the restaurant, Hammond never did join us.\nBut James and I were not short of company. Oh, look, there's rhinos! There's actual rhinos! And they've been dehorned. They've had to take its horn out to stop poachers shooting it. But you know what the poachers are doing? They shoot the dehorned ones, because if they track for a couple of days, a rhino, and then it's got no horn, they shoot it, and then they'll never track it again, so it saves time. Do you know how much you get for a rhino horn now? On the... On the market? Yeah, in Vietnam. I'm guessing it's a lot.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSo that's more expensive than gold. Good God. Even the nub that's left that he's got is still worth, I don't know, thousands of dollars. I was gonna say, no matter how carefully you dehorn it, there's still horn going down into its nose.\nJeremy: That's such a tragedy, that, you know.\nJames: Yeah. I want to do something about this while we're here. I'm sure we could come up with something. I'm sure we could.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRichard: The next morning, I woke to find I'd been recruited into the Clarkson and May Rhino Protection Squad.\nThey were even convinced that our beach buggies would be ideal for tracking the poachers. I can't deny, they do have a point about the whole rhino thing. It is ridiculous. Two rhinos killed every day in Africa by poachers, and then sold to a market that believes it's a cure for cancer, impotence, even hangovers. But are we necessarily the right men to tackle it head-on in the field? Ow! (YELLS) Wouldn't we be better just popping a 㱠coin in a jar and letting somebody who knows what they're doing solve it? Well, I've got a tranquilizer gun from the place where we were last night, but... I can't see anyone to shoot.\nJeremy: Figuring that the poachers probably didn't use the main road, we went off to look in the bush.\nJames: What about over there?\nRichard: No poachers. Tyre marks. It may be some poacher. Oh, no, wait. BF Goodriches. This is James May.\nRichard: Just so you know, this is stupid.\nJeremy: What's stupid?\nRichard: How would you recognise a poacher when you saw one? And when you find one, what are you gonna do? Shoot him. All we're doing on our journey is driving three beach buggies to the Angolan border. Yeah. Which doesn't further the cause of humanity.\nJames: Exactly.\nRichard: And this does, does it? We've got a day, Hammond. Give us 24 hours. 24 hours. Then, I promise, we'll get back on the road.\nJeremy: Once our sceptical colleague had agreed, I decided to change tack, abandon the cars and search from the air, using some beach-front parasailing equipment. Jeremy? Yes? If we don't make it, please know that I hate you. There's not a breath of wind, so don't be stupid. Oh, my parachute's been... Oh, hello!\nRichard: Goodbye.\n(JEREMY YELLS)\nRichard: sh1t!\nRichard: That's not worked at all.\nJeremy: OK. Right, I'm not gonna do that.\nClearly, my solution was too dangerous for us, so we sent Giovanni up instead.\n(FAINT YELLING)\nLook, he's going over there. He's gonna crash and die. No, he's been blown a bit sideways but- - And downwards.\n(YELLING CONTINUES)\nHe didn't sign up for this, did he?\nJeremy: Giovanni failed to spot any poachers, so we told him to stop messing about and get back to camp to pour some drinks, whilst we had a rethink. Everything we've tried has gone wrong. So let's accept it now and move on. We can go. No. I think the poachers only go out at night. Oh, for God's sake. We'll let the sun set, get some tactical kit. Rifles. Come on, Hammond. You gave us 24 hours before you took our guns and badges.\nJames: He did.\nRichard: OK. I think a couple more beers, head out there. I agree. Let it get dark. Be patient.\nJeremy: Yes. Hunters are patient, aren't they? Exactly.\nJeremy: Once darkness had fallen, we got kitted out with tranquilizer guns and tactical kit and headed back into the bush with a very unsure Richard in tow. I mean, I'd like to stop poachers, but out here at night, what is the poacher-to-lion ratio? What am I more likely to find?\nJeremy: What you have to do is look for rhino tracks, cos that's what the poachers will be following. Literally the most manly thing I've ever done. (IN AMERICAN ACCENT) Grand Tour for men, splashing all over.\n(GUN FIRES)\nRichard: Ow!\nJeremy: Bloody hell!\nRichard: You stupid bastards!\nSomeone's shot me!\nRichard: Hammond? Hammond? Hammond?\nJames: Clarkson, you moron.\nJeremy: Hammond? Right, well, I have to be honest, yesterday was a total waste of time. We achieved nothing. All we did achieve was we seem to have wounded Mr Hammond, who er... well, we couldn't wake him up this morning at all. And because we needed to get going, we've a long way to go, we've had to improvise.\n(HELICOPTER WHIRS)\nAaargh! What the (BLEEP)? What the (BLEEP) is this? You bastards!\n(YELLS)\nJeremy: Back on the ground, James and I had our own problems.\n(RATTLING)\nOh, God! Ow! Ow! This is very good for the gravel rash that I got... during my parachute accident yesterday. Oh, that hurts. What we could really do with is a rain shower to dampen this dust down.\nJames: I think it's unlikely. Yeah, there's no evidence that rain is on its way, I would say.\nJeremy: Soon, word came over the radio that Hammond was on his way to rejoin us... and that he wasn't in the best of moods. What was that? (GRUNTS) What was that about? We didn't want to leave you behind. You wouldn't wake up. No, obviously, you didn't want to leave me behind, so you did the logical thing, which is suspend me from a helicopter whilst asleep. Yes. Most people would arrive at the same conclusion. No, you didn't! You were having a laugh! Do you realise how rough the first road was that you haven't had to drive on? And you got a helicopter ride, which we haven't had. You wouldn't be laughing and sniggering so much if I'd fallen out of that thing, as I could have done. Well, it wouldn't be funny. No, it just wouldn't be interesting.\n(JEREMY SNIGGERS)\nJeremy: With the rhino fiasco behind us, we got back to the job in hand... which was to reach the Angolan border, and therefore prove that beach buggies are brilliant go-anywhere machines and not just frivolous toys.\nToday, however, that theory would be seriously tested. Oh, for God's sake!\n(GROANS)\n(GROANS) Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Christ on a bike! I hate to admit this, but I'm jealous of Hammond. I wish I'd fitted that suspension on my car. How is this car gonna stand up to this punishment all day? Well, since it had been designed by me and made from 40-year-old components, the answer was depressingly predictable. The alternator, as you can see, has come off its hinge. The bolt's supposed to go in there and it's just come off. And the bolt, well, that's somewhere back there, 100 miles. So, my alternator is now held on with a screwdriver that I've hammered into place. And we're running well. Oh. I don't know what I'm gonna do about it, but I don't have a fan belt on there. I've got a problem. (SIGHS) Another five miles, another fan belt. I'm gonna need a pair of tights. And it wasn't just me. I've been through all of that, all of that, the ignition cut-out switch. I've got some weird gremlin.\nJeremy: This road is just shaking these cars to pieces.\nJames: Naturally, Jeremy decided that the only way of keeping his car in one piece was to drive very quickly. My optimum speed is 2.800 rpm, that being my only dial, really. That way, I'm skipping over the top of the ridges. Unfortunately, at this speed, my V8 was emptying the petrol tank every 31 miles. And one of the items we'd forgotten to buy at the camping shop was a funnel. Right, wind's dropped. Here we go. Drink! (GROANS) This is completely safe. Some of the petrol is... Oh, my giddy aunt! The roads are getting worse. Even though the going was appalling... the beach buggies, amazingly, were, more or less, still in one piece. However, as the relentless pounding wore on, the same could not be said of James. Agh! Oh, my God! Honestly, my bones are going to shatter.\n(GROANS)\nI've had enough of this. What I'm doing is I'm trying to soften up the front suspension, and I'm gonna soften the tyres as well. I've done quite a bit under here. Now I'm going to let a bit of air out of the tyres.\n(AIR HISSES)\nJames: This made a huge difference.\n(CLATTERING CONTINUES)\nThis is rubbish! Stop! But it didn't stop. It went on... and on. That day, I did 350 miles, and every single one of them was filled with pain, dust and misery. And that's why, the following morning, I came up with a radical plan. Don't drive on the road, drive near it. I did a bit alongside the road. Admittedly only half a kilometre, but it was bliss by comparison. It was like driving on a freshly resurfaced Silverstone. We don't have to stray miles from it. I agree, that would be foolish, cos we could just end up as skeletons. But, honestly, it's agony in mine. I've got neck ache, headache. I hate it. Right, I tell you what, Hammond. I tell you why I like his idea. If it is smooth off-road, it's more comfortable for us. If it's hopeless out there, we can blame him. Fair enough.\nJeremy: With that settled, we left the road and set out on Highway May. I'll give James one thing, it is smoother than the road, but I am doing 3 mph. I mean, yeah, I like off-roading, I do, but... this isn't exactly quicker, is it?\nJeremy: Sadly, a short while later, we didn't even have smooth going for us. Ow! (GROANS) Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh, spiffing. (GROANS) James, I hope you're happy with this. How bad must it have been for him if this is better? Oh, God al-bloody-mighty! What an idiot that man is! Yeah, this is a lot less bumpy. Oh, Christ! Jesus! Is this better? Really? Stop moaning!\n(GRUNTS)\nJeremy: Hammond, my entire throttle assembly has disintegrated.\nRichard: I can't see why. I'm sure this is all helping it.\nJeremy: Perfectly all right on the road.\nYeah, I don't know why more people don't drive their cars on the road. Stop blaming your failures on the scenery. Every bone in his crotch... that's what I'm gonna break. Every single one of them. And then, if it were at all possible, May Tours got even worse. Oh! Oh, God! The dust! Agh! What is this Star Trek special effect we've arrived in? Oh, my God! I am swimming through dust. I'm actually swimming in it. Oh, dear, oh, dear!\nJames: We had driven into something called fesh fesh, a sand as fine as talcum powder. Oh, shite! And this had made Ali G even more cross.\n(REVVING)\nI can't see a bloody thing now. I've got to... I can't even find James May to kill him.\n(GROANS)\nJeremy: OK, the engine's boiling and I'm stuck.\nAll my electrics have gone haywire My... It's still trying to turn the motor over. The battery's dead. Are you stuck, James? Er... (COUGHING FIT) (COUGHING) I think I'm stuck. Well done, James. Improved our lot no end. So the situation is... Hammond has broken his car, you're stuck, and mine's overheated. Are we going to say, James, that your idea was stupid? It was stupid.\nJeremy: With even Sergeant Stubborn admitting defeat, it was time to throw in the towel. So we got ourselves sorted out, got a wash in the river and headed back to the road.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThere you go. Freshly ironed linen shirt with epaulettes that matches my beach buggy. Ironed by Giovanni. Despite everything, our beach buggies had covered 750 miles of our 1,000-mile journey, and we were now well into the tribal regions of northern Namibia... which is picture-book Africa. Well, this is all a bit too beautiful for words along here. Look at this. Tribal Namibia, I like it. Where we are now, it's genuinely... Well, what would you say, \"unspoiled\"? Yeah. People do live the lives they've led here for thousands of years. Oh, no! Oh, no! I'm dying! Annoyingly, the James May excursion had caused more damage than I'd realised. Oh, now this is stuck on. Oh, bugger. Then, instead of the breakdown-recovery service, some topless ladies arrived...\n(SHRIEKING AND SINGING)\nRichard: Hello.\n...which made knowing where to look a bit difficult. Oh! Erm... Concentrate on the job, Richard. This is unusual. I mean, normally the AA would have done.\n(SINGING CONTINUES)\nThank you! Very good.\n(SINGING CONTINUES)\nOh, there's more.\nJeremy: I, too, was nursing wounds as a result of May Tours. I do seem to have lost...\n(ENGINE CHUGS)\n...one of my cylinders somehow. I'm driving a V7. Basically, this is now Spitty Spitty Bang Bang. So, at the lunch stop, Richard and I decided to get our revenge on Mr May. Clarkson! What? You've put... Where's... That is disturbing. What's annoying is, what have you done with my original vintage VW gear knob? Ah, well, no, good news on that. Giovanni has posted your original gear lever back to your address in London. Has he?\nRichard: Special delivery. What is the matter with you? That's really offensive. Well, I think that's a bit sexist. No, it's not. Why would I want to drive with a rubber pen1s? I don't know. I think you're weird.\n(LAUGHTER)\nRichard: With our break over, we got back on the road.\nFor our American viewers, James May is driving a dick-shift. And it wasn't just James's knob that was keeping us amused. There was something else we'd learned over lunch that was even funnier. James May's fuel tank has a hole in it, or it's split. He's driving a bomb. It's a tense moment, this. It's like the end of a football match when it's 1-1. You're driving along, you know he's gonna blow up, you just don't know when.\nRichard: It's not gonna read well in the papers. \"James May died in an exploding beach buggy, holding a rubber pen1s.\" Oh, shut up! Jeez!\nJames: Oh! In the face!\nJeremy: Once James's fuel tank had run low enough, we pulled over in a small village so he could make some repairs. Well, the wind's blowing that way, so the fireball will go up there. It'll be sudden, won't it, when he goes? Yeah. It's \"woompf.\" \"Woompf\", then a bit of quiet, and then... as all bits come down.\nJeremy: Yes. Here's the split in the tank. Apply this. Oh, hello! You know we've been saying how bad the roads are, Hammond? Yes. They're bad enough to kill an un-killable car. That's kind of a terrifying sight, isn't it? I know. I've never seen that before in my life. A dead Toyota pickup truck.\nJeremy: With James's tank bodged, we knuckled down to getting some miles under our belt. And for the rest of the day, the only person with petrol issues was me. Right. Refuelled, so I'm good now for 31 miles. By the end of the day, we'd made good progress. And when we stopped to make camp... Where the bloody hell's Giovanni? ...we were less than 100 miles from the finish line. So, after supper, we decided to have a conversation - well, argument - about who'd built the best beach buggy. The point is, yours isn't a beach buggy. My car? Yeah. Apart from having a beach buggy's body and the beating, pulsating heart of a beach buggy, namely a Beetle engine. I look at yours and go, \"That doesn't even look like a beach buggy.\" It does and it is! It's a beach buggy. Enhanced, but in the spirit of beach buggying. It isn't. Jeremy, yours is... a freak. Had it existed 100 years ago, it would have been exhibited. People would come from miles and children would peak at it through curtains. \"Oh, look at the monster!\" The point is, I have always loved the spirit of the beach buggy. I love the era that created it and all of that. But the one thing that's made me not like it is the engine reminds me of Hitler. I have removed all of that Hitler DNA from mine, fitted a bloody great V8. It's gone too far. It's Frankenstein's buggy.\nJames: I can settle this. Yours isn't a proper beach buggy. It isn't. But it's more of a beach buggy than yours. Oh, rubbish! Because the true spirit of the beach buggy is the Beetle floorpan and engine, which his has. Yours doesn't have the engine. Mine actually has everything. Mine is the proper beach buggy. I'm sorry about this, James, but... You're not. ...your car was created by the swinging '60s and endorsed by Steve McQueen, one of the coolest people who ever lived, and yet, somehow, you have managed to make your beach buggy boring. Rubbish It is a bit. It is boring. It's a boring firework display. It is. It's boring in that it works. No, James. It doesn't work! The only thing that has gone wrong is a small leak in the petrol tank. Everything else about it has constantly worked. Do you know, every time I've overtaken you, I've looked and thought, \"That's dismal.\" It isn't. It has an elegance and a purity. And when you say, \"You've never come past me\", I come past you every 30 miles because you've run out of fuel. It wheelies, the throttle sticks, the alternator falls off, bolts fall out of it. It... The alternator... You've had to fit a wing on it, which ruins the looks. It's not in the spirit of the beach buggy, but of a man desperately trying to justify a terrible idea. It was a brilliant idea! It doesn't work! I'm fairly conscious right now your car is drinking the fuel out of mine like a sort of plastic vampire. Look, mine has been thirsty. Thirsty? Yes.\nJames: We continued arguing until Giovanni reminded us it was time to go to bed. But I didn't go to bed, because I had business to attend to. Right, Jeremy Clarkson thinks he's being flamboyant, and he doesn't realise that my knowledge of aerodynamics will trump his ability to fit rubber penises to people's cars. sh1t! Hammond! Fire! Help! Hammond! Help! The next morning, as we resumed our journey, I was feeling rather philosophical. I once saw an old lady fall over and drop her shopping bag on the opposite side of the road, and her shopping fell out. And amongst it was an Easter egg, which I assume she bought for a grandchild or something, and it rolled into the road and got run over by a car. It was the most tragic thing I've ever seen... until I saw the front of my car this morning.\nJeremy: And it wasn't just the front of his own car he'd ruined. I wouldn't mind, but the rattling from James's workmanship is appalling. Despite everything, though, we were now almost there. Today, we would reach the beach that marked the finish of what had been a spectacular journey through a spectacular country. Oh! That deserves a stabbing.\n(LAUGHTER)\nRichard: Oh, my God!\nOh!\n(SCREAMS)\nJeremy: Oh, my...\nGiovanni, could you run the baths?\n(YELLS)\nAargh! Help!\nJeremy: It really is an amazing part of the world, this. But everything that makes it amazing is harsh and unforgiving and difficult. Oh, stop! No one's ever said this before, but Namibia... is a beautiful b*st*rd of a country. And yet, as we counted down the last few miles of our journey, our home-made beach buggies were still running. They were battered and bruised, but they'd proved our point to Mr Wilman. They'd made it. And they had done something else as well - they'd got under our skin. We liked them even more at the end than we had done at the start. I think everybody in the world should drive a beach buggy, because you're exposed to so much. Not just the elements, but the opinions of other people. I mean, when you're in a normal car, you shake your fist and make gestures, and shout and yell, because you feel cocooned and safe and immune from everybody. But in a beach buggy, everyone's just there. It's brilliant! It's such a friendly way of moving about. And with that, we settled down for what we hoped would be a smooth cruise to the beach. But it wasn't. Ow! Ow! Oh, God! Ow! This is outrageous! Holy sh1t! Oh, no! It's gone! And now my aerodynamics are badly affected as well. Oh, my word! Jeremy is hoping to get to the finish line in the sort of pile of scrap you hate your neighbours for keeping at the bottom of their garden. Oh, God!\nJeremy: (LAUGHS) Oh, no! There's petrol! Oh! Hammond, don't go near his car! There's petrol all over the front of his car. Is there? Yeah.\nRichard: Ooh!\nJeremy: What if it caught fire, James? With just 30 miles to go, the mighty seven-cylinder V8 really started to play up.\n(ENGINE CHUGGING)\n(ENGINE GRINDING)\nOh, no!\n(LAUGHS)\nAnd then it started to go dark, which presented us with the biggest problem of the lot.\n(RICHARD LAUGHS)\nThat's just terrible. Oh, God!\nJames: Well, that's marvellous.\nJeremy: That one is dazzling me and that one is showing me where to go.\nRichard: This is far from ideal.\nJeremy: Before pitch darkness fell, we pulled over to do some emergency repairs. I'm gonna put some... tape of a certain well-known brand on the problem.\nJeremy: Finger tight will do. These repairs were extremely successful. Oh, it's swung into my face! No, I can't see a thing. Agh! That's worse! Oh, God. Now they've turned. Oh, no! My car's gone cross-eyed again!\nJeremy: There's a man coming the other way. What's he gonna think of us? (LAUGHS) I don't know. I can't see a bloody thing. Thank you. Oh, that's good! It's shaken the headlight back round again! Yeah! No, it's back again. Oh, just for a moment. Then the rough road brought some new headlight problems. Oh, nothing! Oh, no! Nothing! Nothing! I've got... I've now got nothing at all. OK, Hammond and May, can you just let me know what your lighting situation is now?\nRichard: As long as I hold the flash lever back, I have light.\nJames: If I hold the lever, I get one light and one flashing light, yes. But I have to take my hand off to change gear.\nJeremy: And then Hammond's car suddenly turned into the lighting rig at a Pink Floyd gig. Why does it keep changing? What... And it's all got...\n(GASPS)\nIt's only three kilometres to go now. Three. Ahh! Oh, (BLEEP) hell! Gone. Coming back. Although we couldn't see, we knew we must be close to the beach. It's not... you know, a seaside beach. It must be on a river or a lake, or something. This is uphill. I'm sure that's wrong. That's a big drop there. I don't want to go off there.\nJeremy: I'm not sure this is sensible. Nowhere in any guide I've ever read does it say, \"Explore new territory in a beach buggy with your lights all broken.\" Unable to find anything even remotely resembling a beach, we pulled over.\n(WATER RUSHING)\nWe cannot carry on just plunging around in the darkness, hoping to find the beach. And, anyway, what is that noise?\nRichard: I would say that... is a waterfall. Is it something you want to come across in the dark? Because the other thing I'd say about that sound - it might be my imagination, but that sounds as though it's coming from below, like we're above it. We have climbed up that track. And a waterfall is a drop, by definition. If we're... I don't want to... in the dark. Abandon. I'm not doing it. We'll do it tomorrow. Sun. Let's look at the stars and have one more night in Namibia. We'll find it tomorrow and it'll be fantastically glorious.\nRichard: Tomorrow on the beach.\nJeremy: Giovanni! The next morning, daylight brought answers to our questions. So it wasn't a waterfall. No, it was many waterfalls. Hundreds of waterfalls. And they were just part of what we all agreed was the most beautiful view we'd ever seen. But... many waterfalls. No beach that I can see. Does that count as a beach?\nJeremy: That is a beach.\nJames: I'd call that a beach. The beach. That's got to be it. There's no others. Gentlemen, our quest is at an end. Let us ride... in splendour... to... I'm not finishing that very well. What is it? It's very moving. I'm trying to think of something evocative and Victorian and brilliant.\nRichard: \"Let's go over there and finish our journey\"? No, that's Brummie rubbish! It is! It's the fact.\nJeremy: Unable to find the right words to mark the moment... we set off anyway. Yeah, this is it. We are half a kilometre from our objective. Oh. Oh, no. Path ends. Path ends. Erm... Oh, my God! Well, if this won't get over there, there's no way will theirs.\nJeremy: We split up to look for a path through the rocks...\nJames: Oh, no! ...but it was hopeless. Forget it. Hammond, forget it. We aren't going down this hill. The problem is, even if we could get over this stuff, which we can't...\nRichard: No, we can't. ...have you seen what's between us and the beach? Look at it. There's no way you could drive over that or anywhere near. Look, you can't even go inland. No, we can't go there. And you can't go around that mountain and come at it from the back, cos they're cliffs. Wait a minute. What? I've had... a great idea.\nRichard: Oh, no. No. So we can't drive over here. But we have to get us and our cars to that beach over there. If there were to be some kind of... A mounting point on that cliff, maybe, and then- Do what? No. Mounting point down there. Over that distance? That's a huge distance. It's about half a kilometre. No! But can you imagine the forces on it? The things at the end are gonna have to be... Huge. Massive. Jeremy, we don't all live in a cartoon. We will die! Dead!\nRichard: Given that there were no alternatives, we had to go with the ape's plan, which was to turn our beach buggies into cable cars. That's over two metres. Yeah, that's good enough. So we headed to a nearby abandoned mine... to scavenge materials.\nJames: Is that bit any good? How much more of that cable have we got? Four drums. Are you proposing that that becomes a winding drum? Yeah. It's very important... we get as much weight as possible into Hammond's car... for erm... well, for your amusement.\n(COUGHS)\n(METAL CLATTERING)\nRight, toolbox.\n(CLANGING AND GRUNTING)\nJames: How much do you want?\nJeremy: 30 metres.\nJames, have you got that hoop welded in yet? No, that's my next job.\nRichard: Several days later, and with absolutely no help whatsoever from any Namibian mining engineers... the world's first beach buggy cable car was ready, and-\nJeremy: sh1t! Stop, everybody! The goats are eating the tree that we've anchored it to. Shoo, goats! Shoo!\n(BLEATING)\nThey were eating the tree.\nRichard: Anyway, as I was saying, it stretched for more than a third of a mile. And since the drop to the crocodile-infested river was several hundred feet, we decided James should go first. We had a vote. Did you? We did, and we were unanimous you were going first. Right, so it's become a democracy all of a sudden?\nJeremy: Yes, it has.\nRichard: Yeah. And anyway, your car's the lightest, now you've burned half of it away. I'm climbing in. Jesus!\nJeremy: With the state-of-the-art generators fired up...\n(CHUGGING)\n...James fortified himself for the journey... Is he drinking? ...and then simply drove off the launch pad.\nJames: Oh, my God! Whoa!\n(CREAKING)\nOh, sh1t! It's really high! It's really high! I'm turning the engine off.\nRichard: We had to test it.\nJeremy: Well, exactly. He had to go first. Don't look at us and think we're bad. Because that was scientifically vigorous.\n(CREAKING)\nIt's a cable car. It's a cable car. I've been on lots of cable cars. They're safe.\nJeremy: God. Look, he's... This is where it's high.\nRichard: That's horrible. No! It's going really high! I don't like...\n(SCREAMS)\nJames: I hate you!\nOK.\nHe doesn't like us.\nJames: Despite my terror, the cable buggy kept on chugging through what's technically Angolan airspace towards the beach. God, I'm nearly there!\n(CREAKING)\nNeutral. Handbrake off. He's gonna do it. He's gonna do it. I'm at the end!\nJeremy: He's down.\nRichard: That's a landing. Yes! Do you know what, though? What? I'm doing maths here. Mm? One of us is gonna be killed doing this, obviously, yes? I'd say so, yeah. So when we were all here, 33% chance. Now I'm doing it with a 50% chance. Now you're doing it? I'm going next. I can go next. You can't go next. Why can't I go next?\n(CREAKING)\nJeremy: Whilst James toasted his success with some more drink... I won the argument and prepared for launch.\nWhy is my car at this angle? Well, maybe because there's a massive V8 hanging out the back of it. Right! Right, right, right! I'll... here we go.\n(ENGINE STARTS)\n(GROANS)\nMy rectum has just opened like a set of theatre curtains. And for good reason, because my beach buggy weighed 200 kilograms more than James's charred wreck. Ooh! Ooh! He brushed the grass! I'm terrified, I'll be honest, but, for the first time since I set off, I'm comfortable in my beach buggy.\n(METALLIC CLUNK)\nApproaching the beach. Approaching the end of the journey. Here I come. And... touchdown! Yes!\nJeremy: Bad news, Hammond. I've made it. Oh, great. Sir? Oh, I say, James!\nJeremy: Actually, I was lucky there was some left, because James had had a bit of a thirst on whilst he'd been alone.\n(GRUNTS)\nHello, guys down there. It's Richard at the top. Right, I'm gonna do this now, so goodbye. Oh! I don't like that feeling!\n(GROANS)\n(GROANING CONTINUES)\nHere he comes, ladies and gentlemen, Richard Hammond. (GRUNTS) No! I could take solace from the fact that this system has already run twice with their cars and not failed it's been tested. Or I could take a more realistic view, which is that those two fat oafs have already weakened it.\nJeremy: Plus he had all that scrap metal in the back, which is why all eyes were on him. Well, when I say \"all\"... Look at the colours in those rocks over there. It's... It's fantastic. Just to the left of where Hammond is. Why's my car sitting so low? It is heavy. It is... Why's it lower? The colouring is fabulous, isn't it? Yeah, they are.\nRichard: Despite all my fears, the cables were holding and drawing me ever closer to my colleagues. This is it. I can see the beach. I'm so nearly there. We are gonna do it! Come on, Hammond. Come on. I'm gonna do it. Come on, Hammond. Come on.\n(CREAKING)\n(METALLIC CLUNK)\n(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)\nOh. Erm... Why have I stopped?\nJeremy: Hammond!\nJames: Come on!\nRichard: I've stopped!\nJeremy: Hammond! It's just stopped! What can I do? It's just stopped! There's, like, 200 metres to go! I don't have anything to do with it! It's not up to me! Is there nothing you can do? Sadly, James was too drunk to think, and I'm mechanically inept. Plus, whatever had gone wrong had gone wrong at the top, and we were at the bottom. Move! Move! Move! There's literally nothing we can do. We've assessed everything and you're in a hopeless position. We could have another beer. We've gonna have to conclude, I'm afraid, that Mr Wilman was right that the beach buggy is no good. And on that terrible disappointment, it's time to end.

The three hosts, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, were tasked with driving a beach buggy across a desert. However, the buggy was not designed for this type of terrain and was not able to complete the journey. The hosts were forced to abandon the buggy and attempt to walk to safety. However, the buggy's cables broke, causing it to stop and leave the hosts stranded. The hosts were unable to do anything to help themselves and were forced to conclude that the buggy was not suitable for the task.</s>【我为群众办实事】“我为群众办实事”实践活动—— 市妇联开展“巾帼心向党 奋斗新征程” 主题宣讲活动"

You want to split that with me?\nLeonard: Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't.\nPriya: Why not?\nLeonard: Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy's Day balloon.\nSheldon: Not quite accurate. The Macy's balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.\nLeonard: So, no, on the Shepherd's Pie. Can we move on?\nPenny: Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. Do not believe it.\nLeonard: Sea bass. I'll have the sea bass.\nHoward: You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.\nLeonard: Kill me.\nSheldon: It wouldn'help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.\nBernadette: Guys, sorry I'm late. I have amazing news.\nSheldon: Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard's faulty digestive system?\nLeonard: So, what's your news, Bernadette?\nBernadette: The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I'm getting my PhD.\nPenny: Oh!\nSheldon: Oh, congratulations.\nPenny: Wow, so that means you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.\nHoward: Congratulations, honey.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nLeonard: So, Howard, tell us, how's it feel knowing that when you two get married, you'll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?\nSheldon: Unless he takes Bernadette's last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.\nHoward: Please, this isn't about me. I'm proud of you.\nBernadette: Well, you'll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They're gonna pay me a buttload of money!\nHoward: What?\nLeonard: Bernadette, that's great. Howard, do you make a buttload?\nHoward: Better than what you've got a buttload of.\nLeonard: Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything's peachy. If you do it, you're still not a doctor.\nPenny: Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy. Credits sequence.\nScene: Raj's apartment.\nRaj (earphones in, singing): Oh, if there was a problem, you can't solve it, check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. Ice, Ice, baby. Ice, Ice, baby. (Removes headphones and goes to refrigerator).\nPriya (off): Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.\nLeonard (off): You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection.\nPriya (off): Shh, my brother's going to hear you.\nLeonard (off): Relax, he's got headphones on. And we're ten miles above Earth in a starship.\nRaj: Really, ten miles? You're orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.\nPriya (off): I can't believe I'm wearing my brother's Halloween costume.\nLeonard (off): I can't believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.\nRaj: Okay, gotta go.\nScene: Howard's house.\nHoward: Hey, what's up?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?\nHoward: No, Ma! It's Raj!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): He's a doctor too, right?\nHoward: Yes!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!\nHoward: Sheldon, yes! Everybody's a doctor but me!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Well, whose fault is that?\nHoward: What's up?\nRaj: Leonard's putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?\nHoward: Sure, but I'm going out with Bernadette. It'll just be you and my mother.\nRaj: I guess that's okay.\nHoward: Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Of course, he and I can play doctor!\nRaj: She's kidding, right?\nHoward: I don't know, she's pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is talking to Amy on webcam.\nSheldon: I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.\nAmy: It's indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.\nSheldon: Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.\nAmy: I'll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?\nSheldon: It's a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.\nAmy: Have you considered massage?\nSheldon: I'd like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.\nAmy: I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.\nSheldon: Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.\nAmy: Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.\nSheldon: All right.\nAmy: Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.\nSheldon: Rotating.\nAmy: You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.\nSheldon: You mean the myofascial point?\nAmy: Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I've never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!\nAmy: Don't flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.\nSheldon: There's someone at my door.\nAmy: That doesn't interest me. Goodbye.\nRaj (at door): Can I sleep here tonight?\nSheldon: Why?\nRaj: Leonard's having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek s*x with my sister.\nSheldon: I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.\nRaj: Oh, don't bother. I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.\nSheldon: No, I can't authorize that.\nRaj: Well, he's in my bed. Why can't I be in his?\nSheldon: The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed.\nRaj: Come on, dude, I'm exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night's sleep.\nSheldon: All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard's bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.\nRaj: Good night, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.\nRaj: You're kidding.\nSheldon: I never kid about safety.\nScene: Leonard's bedroom. Leonard enters, and accidentally sits on Raj. Both exclaim.\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nRaj: I was sleeping.\nLeonard: In my bed?\nRaj: Well, I would've slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.\nLeonard: Oh, you heard?\nRaj: Scotty, I need more power.\nLeonard: Sorry. Does Sheldon know you're sleeping in here?\nRaj: Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?\nRaj: Oh, my God, she's that Mona? Why can't you and my sister spend your nights here?\nLeonard: We tried. She doesn't get along with Sheldon.\nRaj: Sheldon doesn't get along with Sheldon. It's still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.\nLeonard: Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I'll stay at your apartment.\nRaj: Can I bring girls here?\nLeonard: You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.\nRaj: Okay, deal.\nLeonard: Just not against their will.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Do you really think you should be eating that cake?\nHoward: Why?\nLeonard: If you're gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.\nRaj: He's right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.\nHoward: Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I'm not threatened by my fiancée's success. I'm proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career.\nLeonard: Until you have kids.\nSheldon: Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You're okay to stay for a while.\nRaj: When did you take my blood?\nSheldon: Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I'd follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.\nRaj: What the hell is this?\nSheldon: Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.\nRaj: This says you can make end of life decisions for me.\nSheldon: As your friend, let's hope it doesn't come to that. Please sign.\nRaj: Did you sign this?\nLeonard: There's a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too.\nRaj: Well, that seems fair.\nSheldon: Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here's your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.\nLeonard: Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.\nSheldon: Also, you're tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You'll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here's the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights.\nLeonard: No backsies.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Sheldon, dinner!\nSheldon: What is this?\nRaj: This is the difference between eating and dining.\nSheldon: Remarkable. I'm just realizing how much Leonard's been skating by all these years.\nRaj: It's not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.\nPenny (at door): Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?\nSheldon: Yes, it's \"Penny, get your own Wi-Fi.\" No spaces.\nPenny: Thanks. Wow! What's with the fancy spread?\nSheldon: My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me. (Pointing to lapel badge) Uh, nice touch, by the way.\nPenny: What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?\nSheldon: The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.\nRaj: I'm the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.\nPenny: All right, let me try this again. Where's Leonard?\nRaj: He's living at my place, so I'm living here.\nSheldon: You're living here provisionally. But I must say it's looking good.\nPenny: Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That's big.\nSheldon: No. Origami napkin swans, that's the headline.\nRaj: It's a good thing.\nScene: Bernadette's bedroom.\nHoward: So do you know what kind of research you'll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?\nBernadette: Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it's not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.\nHoward: Oh, Bernie, no. You didn't have to.\nBernadette: I wanted to. Come on, open it.\nHoward: You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?\nBernadette: Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: More wine?\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no. I've had way too much already.\nSheldon: Here's an interesting fact about alcohol.\nPenny: Hit me.\nSheldon: Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.\nPenny: Monkeys.\nSheldon: When does a monkey have a trunk?\nPenny: When a suitcase just won't do.\nSheldon: Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.\nPenny: Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I've got to get me some of that?\nRaj: Well, it's a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.\nPenny: What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard's a noisy little dude in the sack.\nRaj: Every night.\nPenny: Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?\nRaj: It's my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?\nPenny: Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?\nRaj: Yeah.\nPenny: I screwed up. Leonard's a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.\nRaj: Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It's better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.\nPenny: Oh, you poor baby.\nRaj: What's wrong with me, Penny?\nPenny: Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren't friends, and you hadn't brought up that creepy pornography story, I'd be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.\nRaj: Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.\nPenny: I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.\nRaj: To friendship.\nSheldon (off): Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!\nScene: Raj's apartment. Leonard and Priya are kissing.\nLeonard: Mmm. Mmm.\nPriya: Leonard, sweetheart, we're kissing, not eating hot soup.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nPriya (computer tone): That's my parents on video chat. Go hide in the bedroom.\nLeonard: Oh, come on! Why don't we just tell them that we're dating?\nPriya: Oh, we've been through this. It's not the time.\nLeonard: When is the time?\nPriya: I've got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I'll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo.\nLeonard: Fine.\nPriya: Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.\nDr Koothrappali: We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City. Is that close to you?\nPriya: No.\nMrs Koothrappali: Where is your brother?\nPriya: Out with friends.\nDr Koothrappali: I don't like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.\nMrs Koothrappali: I'll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.\nLeonard: You're moving back to India?\nDr Koothrappali: Who's that?\nMrs Koothrappali: Oh, my God! There's someone in your apartment. Call the police in America!\nLeonard: When were you going to tell me about this?\nPriya: Oh, hello, Leonard. What a pleasant surprise! Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh's friend Leonard.\nDr Koothrappali: I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.\nPriya: He has many friends.\nDr Koothrappali: Rajesh has many friends?\nMrs Koothrappali: Why are you lying to us?\nLeonard: She's lying because she doesn't want you to know we're dating.\nPriya: Leonard!\nLeonard: Well, what difference does it make? If you're moving back to India, we're obviously breaking up.\nPriya: You know what? I don't want to deal with this right now.\nLeonard: So. Hot in India?\nDr Koothrappali: Of course it is. It always is. It's India. Now, what do you have to say for yourself?\nLeonard: Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.\nScene: Leonard's bedroom. Raj and Penny are in bed.\nPenny (waking up): Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh. Okay, look. This never happened. Do you understand me? (Raj nods) Really? Still can't talk to me?\nScene: The living room. Leonard is asleep on the couch.\nSheldon: What are you doing here?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I said, what are you doing here?\nLeonard: I live here.\nSheldon: I have paperwork that says differently.\nLeonard: Priya's going back to India.\nSheldon: Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you're not going to ruin it. (Knock on door) What are you doing here?\nHoward: I've been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.\nSheldon: Why?\nHoward: She gave me a beautiful watch.\nSheldon: Leonard, do you understand this?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Talk to him. Penny (entering room dishevelled, with a half naked Raj behind): Damn.\nLeonard: What's going on?\nPenny: Oh. It's, it's not what it looks like.\nSheldon: What does it look like?\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

O?\nRORY: Are we going to have to go through this every time we decide who cleans out the refrigerator?\nLORELAI: Do you want to go back to thumb wrestling?\nRORY: Osteoporosis. P?\nLORELAI: (gasps) Puppies! (runs across the street)\nRORY: That's not a disease. Oh boy. (runs after her)\nLORELAI: (to all the puppies) Hi! Oh hi! Hi! Oohh! Rory look at the baby! (in front of one)\nRORY: Mom.\nLORELAI: Aw, Buttercup was found cold and wet hovering under a hydrangea bush along highway 26. It's a sad highway.\nRORY: As compare to all the other happy highways she could've been abandoned by.\nLORELAI: Her lineage includes cocker spaniel, golden retriever, bouvier des flandres -\nRORY: Gesundheith\nLORELAI: Thank you - and rottweiler.\nRORY: Buttercup is a special dog. She's extremely skiddish and tends to react badly towards blonde haired females, brunette males, children of either s*x, other animals, red clothing, cabbage or anyone in a uniform.\n(Luke walks up to them)\nLORELAI: (to Luke) Hey, we just found the doggy version of you.\nMAN: Can I help you?\nLUKE: Do not let these two anywhere near a dog. They can barely feed themselves.\nLORELAI: Shut up you! We'd be excellent pet owners, thank you.\nRORY: You cannot be serious.\nLORELAI: We could get him a pretty bowl...\nRORY: It's a her.\nLORELAI: ...and a new name...\nRORY: Mom.\nLORELAI: ..cause this 'Buttercup' thing really has got to go.\nRORY: Do I need to remind you of Skippy?\nLUKE: Skippy?\nLORELAI: I can't believe you would bring up Skippy.\nRORY: Skippy was our hamster.\nLORELAI: He doesn't care.\nLUKE: What happened to Skippy?\nLORELAI: Nothing happened to Skippy.\nRORY: Every time mom would put her hand in his cage, he'd bit her.\nLORELAI: And laugh.\nLUKE: Hamster's can't laugh.\nLORELAI: Oh this one laughed - trust me.\nRORY: So finally she got fed up.\nLUKE: Of being laughed at by a hamster?\nLORELAI: Well yeah.\nRORY: So she stopped cleaning it's cage. Instead everyday she would stuff some Kleenex in there.\nLUKE: You didn't?\nLORELAI: It was the quilted kind (with a small smile)\nRORY: So this keeps going on and the cage is just a cage full of Kleenex that moves a little, and the smell? Really good.\nLUKE: I can imagine.\nLORELAI: Oh no you can't\nRORY: So then she takes the cage to the place where we bought him, waits for the sales guy to go behind the desk and dumps it on the counter then bolts.\nLUKE: You abandoned your hamster.\nLORELAI: Look, I know it was bad, but this was a vicious hamster. This was like a Damien hamster with little beady eyes and a big forked tail and...a cape with a...hood...and bye bye Buttercup. Bye Luke.\nRORY: You did the right thing. (both walking away from the puppies with arms around each other)\nLORELAI: Oh (in a whiny tone). I want a pet.\nRORY: You have me.\nLORELAI: You won't bring me my slippers in the morning.\nRORY: I might if you had slippers.\nLORELAI: Will you wear a collar?\nRORY: No.\nLORELAI: It'll be pink!\nRORY: You're sick.\nLORELAI: Hey watch how you talk to me. Remember what happened to Skippy.\n(Cut to Max Medina's apartment. He's cleaning while Lorelai sits on the counter eating out of a pot.)\nLORELAI: Mmm...God this is good!\nMAX: OK. Correct me if I'm wrong.\nLORELAI: Salt please.\nMAX: Twenty minutes ago we were sitting at the dinner table were we not?\nLORELAI: Yes we were.\nMAX: There were candles and flowers and plates and knifes and cloth napkins.\nLORELAI: I love the little sombrero napkin holders, very ole.\nMAX: And the whole time we were at said dinner table, you ate two maybe three bites of this amazing dinner I made for you.\nLORELAI: Pass the bread.\nMAX: And yet, as soon as that dinner's over and I start cleaning up, suddenly that's when you're starving.\nLORELAI: What can I say - watching someone work makes me hungry. If I hadn't stopped watching \"This Old House\" I'd be 500 lbs right now.\nMAX: Hmm.\nLORELAI: What are you doing?\nMAX: Passing these to you?\nLORELAI: In the dish please. Ha ha ha. (as Max puts food into pot.)\nLORELAI: So where did you learn to make osso bucco anyway?\nMAX: Um, from this very old Italian woman...who used to live upstairs...um, s-she had lost her husband a couple of years before and she kinda looked at me as like a son.\nLORELAI: Sweet!\nMAX: She was.\nLORELAI: So an old girlfriend huh?\nMAX: Yep.\nLORELAI: Mm hm.\nMAX: So would you like some coffee?\nLORELAI: Yes please. (Walks by Max and their faces come very close together)\n(Lorelai walks over to his desk)\nLORELAI: Hey did you read Rory's paper yet?\nMAX: Not yet.\nLORELAI: It's really good.\nMAX: I'm sure it is.\nLORELAI: Oh and look! It's right on top.\nMAX: Isn't that a coincidence?\nLORELAI: (laughs) Wow, there are some really big words in here. I just hope you have a dictionary with you when you read it.\nMAX: Oh I will.\nLORELAI: You know I could just save you the time and uh, put an 'A' on it for you.\nMAX: Well that really wouldn't be fair to the other students who's mothers aren't here tonight would it?\nLORELAI: Yes you're right. (pause) Although, life isn't fair and the sooner those kids learn that the better.\nMAX: Well I'll take that advise into account.\nLORELAI: (giggles). (turns around to look at his books) Wow these are beautiful!. Hm, I never read Proust, I always wanted to. Every now and then, I'm seized with an overwhelming urge to say something like \"As Marcel Proust would say..\" but of course I have no idea what Marcel Proust would say so I don't even go there. I could do, uh, \"As Micheal Crichton would say..\" but it's not exactly the same you know.\nMAX: Well, take it.\nLORELAI: Oh no! It-it looks so valuable\nMAX: It's a book. It's meant to be read.\nLORELAI: You sure?\nMAX: Take it, read it.\nLORELAI: Ok, I will.\n(She takes the book and sits down and starts to read)\nMAX: (laughing) Not now!\nLORELAI: What?\nMAX: I'd rather you didn't read it now.\nLORELAI: But um, what about (Max kisses her) my required reading (stands up, moving towards the bedroom, between kissing..) But I won't make the cheerleading squad! (kissing) Mr. Medina, is this my extra credit work because Missy just had to take a test!?! (laughing through kisses. Door closes.)\n(Cut to Lorelai sneaking in with shoes in hand)\n(Rory's waiting up on the couch)\nRORY: Where do you think you're going?\nLORELAI: Hi.\nRORY: It's one o'clock in the morning.\nLORELAI: I know but my watch stopped during a terrible car wreck and I had to save kittens and small children and four baby chicks.\nRORY: Did you have a nice time?\nLORELAI: Not bad. (smiling)\nRORY: That's a very big smile for a not bad night. (Lorelai sits on the couch)\nLORELAI: Yeah well...Hey he loaned me a book.\nRORY: What book?\nLORELAI: 'Swann's Way'\nRORY: Aren't we ambitious.\nLORELAI: Yes we are.\nRORY: You know what it means when a man loans you a book don't you?\nLORELAI: That he's already read it?\nRORY: Yep.\nLORELAI: (laughs a little) How was your night?\nRORY: Homework.\nLORELAI: How many times did Dean call.\nRORY: Not that many.\nLORELAI: How many?\nRORY: Three (Lorelai looks at her)...Five.\nLORELAI: (laughs) Not an all time high but very respectable. I'm going to bed. You staying here?\nRORY: Yeah. I'm comfortable. I've got the pillows in a perfect mushed position.\nLORELAI: Ok. Night mom. (kissing Rory)\nRORY: Yeah you just go think about what you've done.\nLORELAI: (with big smile) I will.\nRORY: Hey.\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: You look happy.\nLORELAI: I am kid.\nRORY: Just checking.\n(Cut to Chilton - Mr. Medina's class)\nMAX: \"There's a certain slant of light, winter afternoons that oppresses like the heft of cathedral tunes.\" That, my friends is the first verse of a poem by Emily Dickenson. Now read some of those tonight, and as you do, consider the fact that Emily Dickenson writes convincingly about passion and about the world in spite of the fact that she lived as a virtual recluse. It'll help you appreciate her mind. (bell rings)\nMADELINE: I could listen to him talk about passion all day. Do you think he's dating anyone?\nLOUISE: Of course he is.\nMADELINE: A teacher?\nLOUISE: Please.\nMADELINE: Why not?\nLOUISE: Have you seen teachers?\nMADELINE: He's a teacher.\nLOUISE: Male teachers are different. They can still be mysterious.\nMADELINE: I bet his girlfriend's pretty.\nLOUISE: I bet she's dumb.\nMADELINE: Why?\nLOUISE: Dumb girls crave smart men. It's that whole Marilyn Monroe - Arthur Miller syndrome.\nMADELINE: I still think she's lucky\nPARIS: Whoever he's dating is a loser, who doesn't care that he's a teacher in this ridiculous school making a ridiculous teacher's salary. (to Rory) What are you looking at? (walks away)\nLOUISE: Guess someone read the paper today.\nMADELINE: I know. Paris' parent's divorce is getting very ugly!\nLOUISE: Her dad should've just paid her mom everything she wanted and this whole thing would've been over.\nMADELINE: That's what my dad did. (to Rory) Hi!\nLOUISE: Hi.\nRORY: Hey.\nMADELINE: Is it true Paris' mom had the entire back of her body surgically reconstructed?\nLOUISE: Well it doesn't match the front now does it?\n(Cut to Grandma's house)\n(Dinner time)\nGRANDMA: How's the squab?\nRORY: It's good.\nGRANDMA: Lorelai?\nLORELAI: It's the best tiny, weird bird I have ever eaten.\nGRANDMA: I'm glad.\nLORELAI: Why are you smiling like that?\nGRANDMA: What are you talking about?\nLORELAI: You're smiling.\nGRANDMA: I'm happy.\nLORELAI: That's not your \"I'm happy\" smile.\nGRANDMA: Well what smile is it Loerlai?\nLORELAI: That's your \"I've got something on Lorelai\" smile.\nGRANDMA: Rory your mother must be very tired.\nRORY: She works a lot.\nLORELAI: I grew up with that smile - I know that smile.\nGRANDMA: Tell me about school.\nRORY: Well, my French final went pretty well.\nLORELAI: You can change the subject. I know the smile.\nGRANDMA: Whatever you say dear.\nLORELAI: I've used it a few times myself.\nRORY: Mom.\nGRANDMA: So tell me about parent's day?\nLORELAI: What?\nGRANDMA: Parent's day? Next Wednesday? When all the parents are supposed to go to the classes with their children all day long?\nLORELAI: The Chilton newsletter came out today!\nRORY: Yup.\nLORELAI: Right.\nGRANDMA: You didn't read yours?\nLORELAI: Not yet.\nGRANDMA: Ah.\nLORELAI: But you knew that -\nGRANDMA: Well -\nLORELAI: Hence the smile.\nGRANDMA: Lorelai, you're really being silly. There's no evil plan a foot here. I simply brought up a subject I thought we could all talk about.\nLORELAI: Oh right.\nGRANDMA: I'll try another subject - the colour blue is very pleasant isn't it?\nLORELAI: Mom not everybody can wait outside the mailbox for the Chilton newsletter to arrive and then instantly memorize the contents in three seconds.\nRORY: I'd like to weigh in on the blue colour subject please.\nGRANDMA: You have your priorities far be it from me to question them.\nLORELAI: Just because I don't read the newsletter doesn't mean I don't care about my daughter.\nGRANDMA: So are you going?\nLORELAI: To what?\nGRANDMA: To parent's day!\nLORELAI: Why don't we talk about it next Friday when I've actually read the newsletter. I guarantee it'll be more fun.\nGRANDMA: We could except for the fact that parents day is next Wednesday.\nLORELAI: Wednesday?\nRORY: Yup.\nGRANDMA: If we talked about it on Friday then you would've missed it.\nLORELAI: Wednesday huh?\nRORY: It's ok mom, you don't have to be there.\nGRANDMA: I guess we can talk about how you missed it.\nLORELAI: I'm won't miss it.\nRORY: Mom it's not a big deal, you're busy.\nGRANDMA: You know what - I'll go!\nLORELAI: What?\nGRANDMA: Why not? You have to work. I, as you have insinuated, have no life, therefore I will go sit with Rory at parent's day.\nLORELAI: I'm not busy, I'm going. I will be there - that's it. End of story ok?\nGRANDMA: Fine.\nLORELAI: Fine.\nGRANDMA: So did you read on page two about the mother/daughter talent show?\n(Lorelai chokes on her food)\nRORY: You ok? (smiling)\n(Cut to Gilmore house)\nRORY: Mom I have to go! It's almost 8 o'clock!\n(Lorelai running around her room getting ready)\nLORELAI: Wait! Have you seen my orange suede clip thingy?\nRORY: Top right hand drawer.\nLORELAI: It's not there.\n(Rory huffs and goes upstairs to help)\nRORY: Did you check in your purse?\nLORELAI: Yes.\nRORY: Under your scarves?\nLORELAI: Yes.\n(at the bedroom door)\nRORY: In your sock drawer?\n(Lorelai looks in the sock drawer and finds it.)\nLORELAI: (gasps) I love you.\nRORY: I'm gone.\nLORELAI: Bye (give Rory a kiss)\nLORELAI: Hey wait!\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: Blue disco sequence bag?\nRORY: No!\nLORELAI: Why?\nRORY: Bad.\nLORELAI: Really?\nRORY: Bye.\nLORELAI: Bye! (pause) Wait-wait-wait!\nRORY: Mom come on! Mr. Medina's going to be here any minute!\nLORELAI: Ok, just tell me one more thing. Where's the silver dangly bracelet?\nRORY: I'm wearing it.\nLORELAI: Why are you wearing it?\nRORY: Because it's mine.\nLORELAI: Oh...right...Hey can I borrow your silver dangly bracelet?\nRORY: I'll leave it on the table for you.\nLORELAI: Thank you.\n(Rory heads for the door and the doorbell rings)\nLORELAI: What was that?\nRORY: The door bell rang?\nLORELAI: Why did the door bell ring?\nRORY: Because someone's at the door.\n(Lorelai comes down the stairs while Max listens from outside.)\nLORELAI: It's 8 o'clock. Who shows up at 8 o'clock for an 8 o'clock date?\nRORY: I don't know, maybe a Chilton teacher?\nLORELAI: Everybody knows that 8 o'clock means 8:20, 8:15 tops!\nRORY: Well obviously he was raised in a barn.\nLORELAI: I tell you, he's cute but this punctuality thing has knocked 10 points off the dream guy quotient.\nRORY: Mom what do I do? I'm not even supposed to be here.\nLORELAI: Ok so go!\n(Rory turns to leave)\nLORELAI: Oh wa-wa-wait! You have to get the door.\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: Yeah, because I'm not ready.\nRORY: I'm not supposed to get the door remember, we agreed. I don't get the door when you have a date.\nLORELAI: I know but...\nRORY: I'm not even supposed to be here. That's the first rule of the 'Gilmore Dating Handbook'. (as Lorelai fiddle with her skirt zipper). Daughter shall be nowhere near house when said man materializes. It's a good rule, it 's been working.\nLORELAI: Ok, but he's standing out there and it's cold and my slip is now completely stuck in my skirt zipper and they'll have to bury me like this.\nRORY: Mom!\nLORELAI: Just this once! (as she runs upstairs)\n(Rory opens the door)\nRORY: Hi.\nMAX: Rory.\nRORY: Come on in.\nMAX: Thank you (clears his throat)\nRORY: Can I get you something, I mean we don't really have anything but if you wanted something and we had it, I'd be happy to get it for you.\nMAX: I'm fine.\nRORY: We have water.\nMAX: That's ok.\nRORY: It's not bad water actually. I mean it's not a funny colour or anything.\nMAX: I'm good. Really.\nRORY: We have bottled water.\nMAX: No thanks,\nRORY: One bottle actually.\nMAX: I-it's quite alright.\nRORY: We really need to go to the store.\nMAX: So..should we...\nRORY: Sit? Right. Yeah let's sit.\n(They move into living room)\nMAX: So, uh, what are your plans tonight?\nRORY: I'm going over to my friend Lane's house.\nMAX: Sounds good.\nRORY: And you guys are...?\nMAX: Dinner, movie - the usual.\nRORY: Right.\n(Both look upstairs. Max clears his throat.)\nMAX: This is a little uncomfortable.\nRORY: Yes it is.\nMAX: But the thing is, if things go well, the way I hope they're going, then we might be doing this again.\nRORY: Sitting uncomfortably?\nMAX: (laughs) Seeing each other outside of school.\nRORY: That's ok. I am fine with this whole you and my mom thing.\nMAX: Well good. I'm glad.\nRORY: Well, better go. (gets up to leave)\nMAX: It's good to talk to you Rory. (standing up)\nRORY: You too Mr. Medina. (She turns to leave)\nMAX: why don't you call me Max? Just when we're out of school.\nRORY: (turning back) I don't think I can do that.\nMAX: Why not?\nRORY: It just sounds wrong - disrespectful. I mean, you're my teacher Mr. Medina, and if I start to think of you as a 'Max' - even as a part-time 'Max', it just seems lit it would get too confusing.\nMAX: How 'bout then, we'll come up with non-Chilton names for each other. When we're not in school, I'll call you Rebecca.\nRORY: Rebecca.\nMAX: And you'll call me...\nRORY: Norman?\nMAX: Norman?\nRORY: Well...\nMAX: I look like a Norman to you?\nRORY: I'm sorry, 'Psycho' was on earlier and it was just the first name that came to mind. I'll think of something else. How about Alfred?\nMAX: You know what...Norman's fine.\nRORY: Are you sure?\nMAX: I'm positive, I love it. I might make a legal change.\nRORY: Ok. Well I better go.\nMAX: I hope you and Lane have a good time.\nRORY: Thanks. Oh, would you give this to my mom for me?\nMAX: Absolutely.\nRORY: Thanks.\n(Rory starts to leave.)\nRORY: Oh and Norman - have her home by 10.\n(Max waves her off)\n(Cut to Luke's)\n(Rory's sitting at the counter as Sookie and Jackson enter)\nSOOKIE: I can't believe you won't just sell them to me.\nJACKSON: And I can't believe you're being so small minded.\nSOOKIE: My stuffed fried squash blossoms are extremely popular with the customers.\nJACKSON: Yes I know.\nSOOKIE: People come from all over and demand the fried stuffed squash blossoms.\nJACKSON: That's exactly my point!\nSOOKIE: What'll you have sir? Anything that comes with the stuffed fried squash blossoms. That's what I hear day in and day out.\nJACKSON: Yes, great, I know, but all I'm asking you is to try stuffing something a little different this time huh? (holds up a zucchini tush)\nSOOKIE: A zucchini tush?\nJACKSON: Just a temporary name.\nSOOKIE: You want me to serve my customers a genetically engineered vegetable that's named after a butt?\nJACKSON: Hey this is an all natural vegetable hybrid that's perfectly safe, completely delicious, and yes it looks a little odd but you can put in on the map!\nSOOKIE: I want the blossoms.\nJACKSON: Fine. You wanna think small, think small. I'm done. (leaves)\n(Sookie sighs and sits next to Rory)\nRORY: Jackson invented a new vegetable again?\nSOOKIE: Yup.\nRORY: It's too bad that bowling league didn't work out for him.\nSOOKIE: Yeah.\n(Lorelai enters with skates over her shoulder)\nLORELAI: Hey, look I found them.\nRORY: Where?\nLORELAI: They were in that drawer with the roasting pans.\nRORY: Cool.\nSOOKIE: Oooh skates!\nLORELAI: Rory and I have a skating date.\nRORY: I'm Nancy Kerrigan.\nLORELAI: And I'm Tonya Harding. I'm gonna do the whole shoe lace coming untie - nervous break - let me start again act and everything.\nLUKE: (laughing) When was the last time you put those things on?\nLORELAI: Oh, you are constantly trying to ruin my fun.\nLUKE: Do they even fit anymore?\nLORELAI: Yes they fit.\nLUKE: They look rusted.\nLORELAI: Well...can I just have some coffee please?\nLUKE: (sighs) Hand them over.\nLORELAI: Why?\nLUKE: I'm gonna clean them and tighten the blades.\nLORELAI: Really!?!\nLUKE: Yes.\nLORELAI: Can you make them really shiny?\nLUKE: The skates please.\nLORELAI: Maybe add a couple of pompoms.\nLUKE: Just hand them over.\nLORELAI: Thank you!\nSOOKIE: You get really good service here.\nLORELAI: Yeah I do.\n(Sookie's pager goes off.)\nSOOKIE: Gotta go.\nLORELAI: Anything wrong?\nSOOKIE: Too much yeast, too little bowl.\nLORELAI: Enough said.\nLORELAI: (to Rory) So I think I'm just going to go for it and wear the fur-trimmed skating skirt, pride be damned.\nRORY: Hey, what if we invite Max to go skating with us?\nLORELAI: M-max?\nRORY: Yeah, I thought maybe he'd want to go.\nLORELAI: When did you start calling him Max?\nRORY: Well the other night he said that I should probably call him something other than Mr. Medina when we're outside of school. Which makes sense, so I'm getting used to saying 'Max'.\nLORELAI: W- you don't see him that much outside school.\nRORY: No, but I probably will since you guys are obsessed with each other.\nLORELAI: Yeah, well I wouldn't say 'obsessed'.\nRORY: No. It's ok, I mean of all the guys to have hanging around, he seems like a good choice. I like him.\nLORELAI: Good, well that's good.\nRORY: So what do you think about the skating?\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: Mr. Medina - I'm sorry, Max? Do you think he'd wanna go?\nLORELAI: I don't thin he skates. (to Luke) Thanks.\nRORY: Well maybe we could all do something else together.\nLORELAI: Yeah, good. Something else is good. I love something else.\n(Cut to Gilmore house)\n(Kettle whistles.)\nSOOKIE: Ok, tea is ready. How are the feet?\nLORELAI: I don't know. They stopped talking to me.\nSOOKIE: What on earth were you thinking?\nLORELAI: That I could still skate.\nSOOKIE: It's not like riding a bike you know.\nLORELAI: Now you tell me.\nSOOKIE: So, (sitting at table) what are you up to tonight.\nLORELAI: Well, I'm going to do a little line dancing, then run a 10K, then just jump up and down really hard for about an hour.\nSOOKIE: No Max?\nLORELAI: No.\nSOOKIE: Taking a night off?\nLORELAI: I don't seem him every night Sookie.\nSOOKIE: He seems like a great guy.\nLORELAI: He is.\nSOOKIE: That didn't sound very convincing.\nLORELAI: No, he is. He is a great guy - for someone.\nSOOKIE: For someone?\nLORELAI: Yes.\nSOOKIE: Someone else?\nLORELAI: Yes.\nSOOKIE: Someone else who is not you although you're the person spending every waking hour with him.\nLORELAI: Right.\nSOOKIE: Aha. How long have you been dating?\nLORELAI: Why?\nSOOKIE: Two months you've been seeing him right?\nLORELAI: Point Sookie?\nSOOKIE: Mmm. Just right on schedule that's all.\nLORELAI: I have no idea what you're talking about.\nSOOKIE: This is about the time you start doing you little getaway dance. Two months right on the nose - you're good.\nLORELAI: I do not do a dance.\nSOOKIE: You're cha-cha-cha-ing right now.\nLORELAI: I'm not cha-cha-cha-ing. I'm being practical. Rory is starting to get attached to Max and that's not good.\nSOOKIE: Oh Rory's getting attached to Max?\nLORELAI: Yes and since I've decided that Max is probably not the guy for me, I think it's better that we break it off before she gets hurt.\nSOOKIE: Practical\nLORELAI: Yes.\nSOOKIE: Uh, can I say something here?\nLORELAI: Of course you can.\nSOOKIE: Cha-cha-cha.\nLORELAI: Stop that.\nSOOKIE: (singing) Livin' la vida loca.\nLORELAI: Sookie.\nSOOKIE: Shake your bon-bon, shake your bon-bon.\nLORELAI: Hey, you will not stand there singing Ricky Martin songs to me. This is not a pattern ok? I'm not doing what I always do. This is not the same.\nSOOKIE: Actually you're right. Usually you don't get so upset and defensive during the cha-cha talk.\nLORELAI: (painfully) Ah! (as Sookie pours hot water into foot basin)\nSOOKIE: You must really like this guy.\nLORELAI: When did you become the relationship expert? You haven't been in a relationship in years. (Sookie looks sad as Lorelai realizes what she said). Wow! Zero to jackass in 3.2 seconds.\nSOOKIE: That's alright, your feet hurt.\nLORELAI: No it isn't. It's never ever ok for me to talk to you like that. I'm so so sorry. Please honey.\nSOOKIE: (sighs) I understand - really. You know it's not like I don't want a relationship.\nLORELAI: I know. I didn't mean anything by it.\nSOOKIE: (sighs) It's just - it's hard with my hours. I'm always at the inn, or at the market or at the hospital.\nLORELAI: Please - forgive me. Do you wanna...sing some more Ricky Martin to me?\nSOOKIE: No.\nLORELAI: You can you know - I deserver it.\nSOOKIE: (quietly) 'She's into superstition, black cats and voodoo dolls. (louder) I've got a premonition, that girl's gonna make me fall.' (imitates guitar tunes)\n(Cut to Chilton)\nTRISTIN: You know I heard that Paris' dad's actually got a second family in Paris.\nGUY: Whoa.\nTRISTIN: Yeah.\n(Rory rolls her eyes as she walks by.)\nMAX: Uh, Rory?\nRORY: Hey Mr. Medina.\nMAX: I enjoyed your paper on Dickenson.\nRORY: I had fun writing it.\nMAX: It showed.\nRORY: Thanks.\nMAX: You're welcome (Rory turns to go) Um, Rory?\n(Rory turns back)\nRORY: Yeah?\nMAX: No, that's it. That's all I wanted to say.\nRORY: My name?\nMAX: Yes.\nRORY: Ok.\nMAX: Actually I just wanted to see if Lore- (looks around) if your mom is coming to parent's day.\nRORY: Oh well...\nMAX: Cause I'm just trying to get an accurate number of parents who are coming - you know for the cookie count.\n(Rory smiles at him)\nMAX: Forget it. (sighing)\nRORY: She's coming.\nMAX: (relieved) I hadn't heard from her for a while about it and -\nRORY: She'll be here.\nMAX: Ok, good. Good.\nRORY: But you should put us down for four.\nMAX: Four what?\nRORY: Four cookies.\nMAX: Ok, good. I will.\nRORY: Bye.\n(Max sighs)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Cut to Gilmore house)\n(Lorelai is cleaning out the fridge.)\nLORELAI: Four slices pepperoni pizza.\nRORY: From?\nLORELAI: Tuesday?\nRORY: Last Tuesday?\nLORELAI: The Tuesday in the not so distant past.\nRORY: Toss it. (sits at table) So you remember Paris Geller.\nLORELAI: Your very best friend in the whole world?\nRORY: Her parents are getting a major divorce.\nLORELAI: Really.\nRORY: Her dad's like this big wig at a huge pharmaceutical company and they're printing all the sordid details about it in the paper.\nLORELAI: Ooh how sordid?\nRORY: Well, it's not the Rich James incident, but Hugh Grant should be feeling pretty good about himself.\nLORELAI: If she was anyone else in the entire universe I might feel bad for her.\nRORY: Actually I kind of do feel bad for her.\nLORELAI: That's because you are the nicest kid ever to walk the earth.\nRORY: The whole school's talking about it. And the weird thing is that the whole dynamics there has changed for me.\nLORELAI: Really? How so? (gets up to go towards fridge)\nRORY: Well, Madeline and Louise, Paris' best friends, they said hello to me the other day.\n(Both munching on cold fries)\nLORELAI: Really? Like a normal hello? Not like a 'Here's Johnny' kind of hello?\nRORY: Normal, friendly, no acts.\nLORELAI: Wow, you're the new 'Heather'\nRORY: I guess.\n(Lorelai pulls out another pizza box)\nLORELAI: Oh, hey, this is the pizza from mystery Tuesday. That one's completely fine (pointing to the one in the garbage bin.)\nRORY: Don't.\nLORELAI: It's in the box!\nRORY: Oscar!\nLORELAI: Felix!\nRORY: Forget it!\nLORELAI: Fine.\n(Rory goes back to table.)\nRORY: So how's 'Swann's Way' coming.\nLORELAI: Oh finished.\nRORY: You're kidding! It took me forever to read that. I had to renew it 10 times.\nLORELAI: The first sentence - I finished the first sentence.\nRORY: Aha.\nLORELAI: Yeah - it's just - I'm so swamped right now you know, it's the totally wrong time to start reading the longest book known to man. Hey maybe you could give it back to Max for me?\nRORY: Just bring it with you tomorrow.\nLORELAI: Tomorrow?\nRORY: Parent's day?\nLORELAI: I know (she didn't) I'm just - I'm not sure I'm going to be able to make it.\nRORY: What do you mean?\nLORELAI: Well I have that thing at the inn and I thought I could get away and now I can't.\nRORY: What thing?\nLORELAI: The thing - the inn thing?\nRORY: What inn thing?\nLORELAI: You know.\nRORY: No I don't.\nLORELAI: The thing at the inn with the flags and the little men and the peanuts - the thing.\nRORY: Little men?\nLORELAI: Forget it, it's not important - I just don't think I can go.\nRORY: Ok, fine.\nLORELAI: So, if you could give this book back to Max tomorrow - that would be great.\nRORY: Why don't you just give it back to him the next time you see him.\nLORELAI: Because I'm not sure when that would be and he should have his book. (getting a bit upset)\nRORY: You see him all the time.\nLORELAI: Rory, could you just (drops book on table) give it back to him ok?\nRORY: Are you breaking up with him?\nLORELAI: What are you talking about?\nRORY: Well he hasn't heard from you and now you're asking me to give him the book back.\nLORELAI: How do you know he hasn't heard from me?\nRORY: He wanted to know if you were going to Parent's day and then he mentioned that you guys hadn't talked lately.\nLORELAI: He shouldn't be asking you about me.\nRORY: Why are you breaking up with him?\nLORELAI: Because it's not working out.\nRORY: But you seemed so happy.\nLORELAI: It's not right - that's all.\nRORY: So that's why you're not going tomorrow?\nLORELAI: No, I'm not going tomorrow because of the thing at the inn.\nRORY: That's crap and you know it (upset)\nLORELAI: Hey -\nRORY: There is no thing at the inn, you're avoiding Mr. Medina and you're trying to lie to me and you promised you would go and - hey, do whatever you want. I don't care, just leave me out of it. And give him the book back yourself. (Rory goes to her room and slams the door.)\nLORELAI: Fine I will. (takes the pizza out of garbage.)\n(Cut to Chilton)\nLORELAI: Hey, not so fast.\nRORY: The bell's gonna ring.\nLORELAI: Before you go one more step - tell me you like me?\nRORY: You bug me.\nLORELAI: I'll take that as a yes. And I want you to know that I will deal with my issues with Max myself.\nRORY: Fine.\nLORELAI: Really.\nRORY: I believe you.\nLORELAI: So where are we going?\nRORY: To my locker to drop off some of this stuff.\nLORELAI: Great, let's do it.\n(see Paris and her mother by Paris' locker arguing)\nPARIS: You can't just leave now.\nMOM: Paris please.\nPARIS: At least come to my lit class.\nMOM: This place is giving me a headache.\nPARIS: Mom.\nMOM: Is your face breaking out?\nPARIS: No.\nMOM: You have not being using that cleanser have you? Now Dr. Yanalari prescribed that cleanser for a reason - to cleanse.\nPARIS: Just lit class.\nMOM: Paris with everything I have going on right now the last thing I need to do is face a bunch of bored people who are gossiping about me. I'll see you later at home. Use that cover stick I got you.\n(Paris sighs)\nLORELAI: I bet I'm looking pretty good to you right now.\nRORY: Yes you are.\nLORELAI: Hmm. So what's first? Wait don't tell me.\nRORY: English lit with Mr. Max Medina.\nLORELAI: Ok see I told you not to tell me.\nRORY: Sorry\nLORELAI: Mr. Medina's class huh?\nRORY: The fancy book owner himself.\nLORELAI: How does first annual mother/daughter ditch day sound?\nRORY: Not happening.\nLORELAI: Yeah yeah, ok - let's go.\n(Cut to Mr. Medina's class)\nMAX: On Monday we will start a two week of creative writing exercise, but that doesn't mean we stop reading. One of the greatest inspirations of working writers is the writing of other that they admire. Walt Whitman read Homer, Dante, Shakespeare. And the novelist Edna O'Brien has been quoted as saying 'that every writer should read some Proust every day' Now, at this point, normally I would impress the partens by pulling out a copy of Proust's 'Swann's Way' and reading a particularly difficult passage but alas, you're all saved. I have misplaced my copy. (bell rings) Oh that does is - parent's thanks for coming, students - papers on Whitman are due tomorrow and those of you who are just starting tonight - I'll be able to tell.\nLORELAI: So you go on ahead ok? I'm going to talk to Max for a second.\nRORY: Please be nice.\nLORELAI: I will, I will.\nLORELAI: (to Max) Hi.\nMAX: Hi - it's nice to see you.\nLORELAI: Yeah. I've been really busy.\nMAX: Oh sure - I assumed.\nLORELAI: I wanted to give this back to you.\nMAX: Keep it.\nLORELAI: I really liked it. I like the first 20 pages anyway, then I got busy and I can see you really need it so - (tries to give him the book)\nMAX: What's going on Lorelai?\nLORELAI: Nothing. I just don't think a book whose first sentence is 20 pages long is for me.\nMAX: Well I left four messages\nLORELAI: I know - I've been meaning to call.\nMAX: What's been keeping you?\nLORELAI: I don't know - things.\nMAX: Uh huh.\nLORELAI: Sorry.\nMAX: Sorry?\nLORELAI: That I didn't call.\nMAX: Ok.\nLORELAI: So - here. (tries to give him book again)\nMAX: Why do you keep on trying to give me the book?\nLORELAI: Because it's yours.\nMAX: Is there something going on here that I don't know about?\nLORELAI: Yeah, uh I hate Proust.\nMAX: Lorelai?\nLORELAI: Look, um Rory's out there waiting for me so... (tries to give him book again)\nMAX: Wa-wait a minute...Oh my God! I cannot believe what an idiot I am.\nLORELAI: What?\nMAX: You're breaking up with me aren't you?\nLORELAI: I don't know.\nMAX: Not only are you breaking up with me, you're doing it really badly.\nLORELAI: Am I being graded?\nMAX: No, I'm a little disappointed. I would've expected a better dumping from you.\nLORELAI: Nobody's dumping anyone.\nMAX: Really? Then what is this?\nLORELAI: I just need space.\nMAX: Well I don't. In fact I want as little space as possible. 100 clowns crammed into a Volkswagen. That's the kind of non-space I'm talking about.\nLORELAI: It's not working.\nMAX: It was working pretty good the other night.\nLORELAI: Look it is what I've been trying to tell you all along. This is a family. Rory and I, you walked into a family, but you weren't listening and now she's getting attached and I'm afraid she's gonna get hurt.\nMAX: So you solution to all of this is not to return my calls\nLORELAI: It just took me a while to figure things out and it all came clear when I realized how much we could hurt Rory.\nMAX: Don't you mean how much we could hurt Lorelai?\nLORELAI: Hey - I can take care of myself.\nMAX: I don't understand this. I thought we went through this. W-we decided she could handle it.\nLORELAI: Well maybe she can and maybe she can't. I'm not ready to find out.\nMAX: I'm not going to let you off that easily.\nLORELAI: Well there's nothing you can do about it.\nMAX: There has to be.\nLORELAI: There isn't.\nMAX: There is.\nLORELAI: Well no there isn't.\nMAX: Yes there is.\nLORELAI: What are we in high school? Well I know we are in a high school.\nMAX: This is so not you.\nLORELAI: Well, you don't know everything about me.\nMAX: I guess not, because I would've thought that blaming this all on Rory and giving me these lame apologies was weak, pathetic and beneath you.\nLORELAI: Just take you damn book\nMAX: You've missed me.\nLORELAI: Stop it.\nMAX: I know you did, you're missing me right now aren't you?\n(Lorelai sighs)\nMAX: Answer me.\nLORELAI: Look class is over -\nMAX: Well we're back in session.\nLORELAI: Well I didn't raise my hand so don't call on me! I came here to give you this book back, please take it.\nMAX: I swear to God if you try to give me that book one more time...\n(They kiss passionately. Outside the class Paris walks by and sees them kiss)\n(Cut to cafeteria)\n(Gets noisier and noisier as Paris walks from table to table talking to people. Tristin walks by Rory and makes a 'kiss' sound to her. Paris walks up to Rory.)\nRORY: What's going on?\nPARIS: Oh, everyone's just talking about the mom that Mr. Medina was seen kissing just now.\nRORY: What?\nPARIS: And the weird thing is - she looks a lot like your mom.\nRORY: What are you talking about?\nPARIS: Your mom - Mr. Medina, mouths open. I saw them. How's the coleslaw? Good? (walks away)\n(Lorelai walks into cafeteria)\nLORELAI: Hey, did you save me some jello?\n(Rory gets up and leaves)\nLORELAI: What? (follows Rory out) Rory?! Hey where are you gong?\nRORY: Were you kissing him?\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: Mr. Medina, just now, were you kissing him?\nLORELAI: Yes.\nRORY: What the hell is wrong with you?\nLORELAI: I don't know.\nRORY: You said you were breaking up with him.\nLORELAI: I was.\nRORY: I know I told you to be nice to him but this was a little extreme don't you think?\nLORELAI: It wasn't supposed to happen.\nRORY: Paris saw you! It's all over the school!\nLORELAI: Oh God - oh Rory, I'm so sorry. I really am. See this is exactly why I didn't want to date him.\nRORY: You didn't want to date him so you wouldn't come to my school and kiss him and humiliate me?\nLORELAI: Yes that's exactly it.\nRORY: Why would you do this?\nLORELAI: Because I'm human, because I screwed up. I'm sorry.\nRORY: If you like him so much then why are you breaking up with him?\nLORELAI: Look, I broke the rules when I brought him into our lives and I realize now that that was a very bad idea.\nRORY: But why?\nLORELAI: Why?! Because we are standing in this stairwell yelling at each other that's why! Because it's affecting you, it's seeping into your life and that is the whole reason I made these rules in the first place. Is-is to protect you!\nRORY: You know what, maybe it was a good idea that you hid your personal life from me when I was a kid but I'm not a kid anymore.\nLORELAI: No, you're right. You're a 40 year old divorcee - my mistake.\nRORY: Ugh! I can't believe you're blaming this on me!\nLORELAI: I'm not blaming you!\nRORY: You made up these stupid rules years ago about the way the Gilmore women would run their lives and now you're sticking to them even though they're crazy!\nLORELAI: Oh hey my crazy, stupid rules are the reason we're doing so good in our lives. They're the reason you grew up the way you did, the reason you're even in this school and the reason you're going to go to Harvard so don't you dismiss my rules.\nRORY: Fine! Great! Well, maybe it's time for the rules to change!\nLORELAI: Yes, well that's for me to figure out, not you!\nRORY: Great! Fine! Well could you figure it out before French class because I'd rather you didn't start making out with Mrs. Collins.\nLORELAI: Hey no promises until I see what she looks like!\n(Cut to front of Grandma's house)\nLORELAI: Look, let's just refrain from fighting in front of the grandmother ok?\nRORY: Fine with me.\nLORELAI: The last thing I need tonight is a confrontation with my mother\n(rings doorbell)\nLORELAI: Hi mom, boy the roads were a mess out there tonight. (entering)\nGRANDMA: Rory go upstairs please.\nRORY: Is everything ok?\nGRANDMA: I have to talk to your mother, please go upstairs.\nRORY: Well -\nGRANDMA: Now Rory.\nGRANDMA: (walks into living room) Lorelai come here!\nLORELAI: Gee mom, did I do something wrong?\nGRANDMA: I try to understand you, I truly do. But sometimes your behaviour baffles me beyond belief.\nLORELAI: And which behaviour is this?\nGRANDMA: Do you have no shame?\nLORELAI: Is that intended as a rhetorical question or - ?\nGRANDMA: Rory goes to school in that place, she has a reputation to protect. You're her mother.\nLORELAI: How did you -\nGRANDMA: You're supposed to shield her from shame not cause it.\nLORELAI: Oh mom?\nGRANDMA: Kissing a teacher...in a classroom...on parent's day!\nLORELAI: Well...they wanted us to get more involved with the school.\nGRANDMA: Are you insane?\nLORELAI: No but you are if you think I'm discussing this with you.\nGRANDMA: When I heard I almost fainted.\nLORELAI: How did you hear mom?\nGRANDMA: I have friends Lorelai. Headmaster Charleston's wife for one.\nLORELAI: Oh, that's great.\nGRANDMA: The entire school is talking about it. And what do I say, how do I defend this?\nLORELAI: It was a mistake.\nGRANDMA: A mistake? A mistake? Is that what you call it a mistake?\nLORELAI: Well I tried to call it 'Al' but it would only answer to 'mistake'.\nGRANDMA: A mistake is when you throw out your credit card bill - a mistake is when you forget to RSVP to a dinner party - a mistake is when the gardeners miss trash day and the barrels are full for a week. This my girl, was not a mistake! Do you even know this man?\nLORELAI: Ah, no, this is the first time I'd seen him and I don't know, there was just something about the way he held the chalk and -\nGRANDMA: This is not the time for your jokes.\nLORELAI: Yes I knew him. I've been dating him.\nGRANDMA: Why on earth would you date Rory's teacher?\nLORELAI: That's none of your business.\nGRANDMA: It most certainly is.\nLORELAI: How do you figure that?\nGRANDMA: When it affects my granddaughter it becomes my business.\nLORELAI: I don't want to talk about this with you!\nGRANDMA: I just want to know what you were thinking. What was the reasoning? How on earth did you justify it to yourself?\nLORELAI: Max is a great guy. An amazing guy! He's smart, he's sweet (teary) he cooks.\nGRANDMA: So you decided to kiss him in your daughter's school.\nLORELAI: No, I decided to breakup with him in my daughter's school and the kissing part just happened.\nGRANDMA: You always let your emotions get in the way. That's the problem with you Lorelai - you don't think.\nLORELAI: Mom - please.\nGRANDMA: He's just a man Lorelai.\nLORELAI: No he's not.\nGRANDMA: Oh so what are you telling me. That this was all worth it because he was the love of you life, that this was the man for you.\nLORELAI: I don't know. He might have been. Excuse me (leaves room)\n(Cut to Chilton cafeteria)\n(Rory sitting at a table. Paris, Louise and Madeline walk up behind her.)\nLOUISE: See, I told you he wouldn't date a teacher.\nPARIS: I wish my mom would sleep with my teacher, it would make midterms a lot easier.\n(Rory slams her book closed, stands up and turns to face them)\nRORY: Madeline, Louise, would you excuse us for a minute?\nLOUISE: Ooh cat fight.\nRORY: Go.\nPARIS: You're not going to kiss me are you? (smiling)\nRORY: What's wrong with you?\nPARIS: Nothing I'm great.\nRORY: You've just spent the past two weeks with all of your family's private problems printed in the newspaper for everyone to read and talk about. I saw how you walked around here! I saw how much you hated it. And then you turn around and pull something like this? Doesn't that seem crazy to you? Do you have any idea how many people you've hurt? Forget me and my mom, what about Mr. Medina? He likes you, he encourages you. He hold up your papers and tells the class how great you are. And then you turn around and spread stories about him. (pause). Whatever, forget it. You have no idea what I'm talking about. (grabs her stuff and starts to leave)\nPARIS: I do like Mr. Medina.\nRORY: Well I'd take some dance lessons cause the way you express yourself needs a little work.\nPARIS: I...probably shouldn't have told people what I saw.\nRORY: No you shouldn't have.\nPARIS: I'm sorry...things have been...well...not good lately.\nRORY: I know.\nPARIS: I just didn't want them talking about me anymore, that's all.\nRORY: Well, it worked.\nPARIS: Yeah.\nRORY: You know, i-if you want to talk -\nPARIS: Hey, we are not friends.\nRORY: Oh that I know. But if you ever do...want to talk about -\nPARIS: I will, if I want to.\nRORY: Ok.\nPARIS: But I probably won't.\nRORY: That's fine.\nPARIS: But if I do -\nRORY: I'm around.\nPARIS: Ok. I'm going now.\nRORY: Bye.\nPARIS: Bye. (Paris starts to leave and turns around)\nPARIS: I doubt I will.\nRORY: I'm not holding my breath. (sighs and leaves)\n(Cut to Independence Inn kitchen)\n(Jackson drops a box of squash blossoms on the counter)\nJACKSON: There - squash blossoms. All large enough for you to stuff and fry up and serve to the desensitize masses who just want what they know. Hurrah! Mediocrity wins again!\nSOOKIE: Jackson?\nJACKSON: You know what, I'm not even gonna charge you for these. I am not going to profit off the death of creativity. I would rather starve myself than know that my food was paid for by the lowered expectations of the American public. (starts to leave)\nSOOKIE: Jackson?\nJACKSON: What?!\nSOOKIE: Would you like to go to dinner sometimes...with me?\nJACKSON: Ok.\nSOOKIE: Ok.\n(Jackson leaves, Sookie's smiling.)\n(Cut to coffee shop in Hartford)\n(Max sitting at the counter)\nMAX: Thanks (to waiter)\n(Lorelai walks in)\nLORELAI: Hey Mister, wanna buy a really nice copy of Proust?\nMAX: How ya doing?\nLORELAI: Hmm. Well you know. You?\nMAX: Well you know it also.\n(Lorelai sits)\nLORELAI: So that parent's day is fun.\nMAX: Oh, it was a big hit this year (both laugh a little)\nLORELAI: Look, the other day, we were going skating, and Rory said \"Why don't we invite Max to come along with us\" and that was a little weird for me.\nMAX: Me too. I don't skate.\nLORELAI: She's never really referred to anyone I've dated by their first name before. I always kept her out of that part of my life, so it was like \"the mustache guy\", \"the earring guy\", \"the peg leg guy\".\nMAX: Oh so you have a thing for pirates.\nLORELAI: She never called anyone by their name before. She likes you. She likes us. So my mind instantly went to \"Oh my God, what if we break up, she'll be crushed\" and then my next thought was \"Oh my God, what if we break up, I'll be crushed\". And then as you know all hell broke loose.\nMAX: I understand.\nLORELAI: I freaked out. I'm so sorry. I never meant to treat you like that, I'm not very good at this, ask Skippy.\nMAX: Skippy?\nLORELAI: (shaking her head) I'm so so sorry.\nMAX: I was called into headmaster Charleston's office today.\nLORELAI: Let me guess. He put his arm around you and said \"I don't understand why you crazy kids can't work this out?\"\nMAX: He said that I was jeopardizing my career and future at Chilton.\nLORELAI: Oh!\nMAX: At first I was incensed, outraged and \"How dare he?!\". And then I realized that he was right. What happened the other day was completely unprofessional. I never in my life would've considered pulling off something like this. He should've fired me.\nLORELAI: But he didn't.\nMAX: Not yet, but the word 'probation' was tossed around quite a bit though.\nLORELAI: I'm sorry.\nMAX: I'm the one that started the kiss.\nLORELAI: And I'm the one that knocked it up to NC-17.\nMAX: I honestly did not think that this was going to be so complicated.\nLORELAI: I know.\nMAX: I mean you told it would be. I didn't listen, I didn't want to.\nLORELAI: It's not your fault. If I hadn't acted like a two year old and tried to run away and pretend that you weren't what you are to me, then we wouldn't have fought, we wouldn't have kissed, I wouldn't have humiliated my daughter and the whole thing would've been fine.\nMAX: (sighs) I do not know what to do here. I-I've never been in a relationship like this before. I'm not thinking straight.\nLORELAI: I know, me either.\nMAX: That was a great kiss.\nLORELAI: Beyond great.\nMAX: Maybe we need to take a little time away from each other.\nLORELAI: Ok. (upset)\nMAX: You know, just to figure out how to do this so it's not so hard.\nLORELAI: Sure...that makes sense.\nMAX: I just - I don't have any other answers right now.\nLORELAI: No you're right. You're absolutely right. (pause) I really really like you Max Medina\nMAX: I really really like you Lorelai Gilmore.\nLORELAI: Well, as long as we got that straightened out.\nMAX: Goodbye Lorelai (gets up and leaves)\nLORELAI: (whispers) Bye.\n(Cut to Gilmore house)\n(Rory comes home)\nRORY: Mom! Mom, I'm home!\n(Goes upstairs)\nRORY: Mom?\n(Finds Lorelai laying on her bed crying.

        "prompt_0": "THE SEEDS OF DOOM\nBY ROBERT BANKS STEWART\nPART ONE\n6:00pm - 6:25pm\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n1, EXT: ANTARCTICA\n(The wind blows and the snow falls in the Antarctic region. Icebergs bob up and down within the rough ocean. In blizzard-like conditions, a man with heavy-weather clothing is kneeling in the snow by a wall, digging with a small pickaxe. Another man joins him, wearing similar clothes. He kneels and communicates with his companion, necessarily shouting because of the howling wind. The two men are Charles Winlett, and Derek Moberley, workers on an Antarctic research station.)\nMOBERLEY: Come on Charles, we've got enough samples, surely!\nWINLETT: This isn't ice - this is something else. Have a look.\n(He reaches down and extracts a small round object, frozen with ice and snow, but unrecognizable to both men.)\nMOBERLEY: What is it?\nWINLETT: Don't know! Let's get it back to camp.\n(They both stand up ready to leave.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n2, INT: RESEARCH STATION - LABORATORY\n(After an exterior shot of the research station, the round object is being examined on a table by the third member of the research team, John Stevenson. He scrapes away the excess ice to reveal a solid, rough, dark green pod or egg. Moberley and Winlett enter.)\nMOBERLEY: Animal, vegetable, or mineral?\nSTEVENSON: Vegetable.\nWINLETT: Yes, that's what we thought.\n(Stevenson holds up the pod on a tray in front of them.)\nSTEVENSON: The cutaneous creasing is unmistakable. When it's properly thawed out I can...confirm it with a cytology test.\n(Winlett is prodding the pod with a scalpel.)\nWINLETT: The skin looks as hard as iron.\nSTEVENSON: Yes, it is a bit of a cannonball. How deep in the permafrost was it?\nWINLETT: About the er... 9th layer.\nMOBERLEY: And that means it's been there for ooh...20 thousand years? What do you make of it, John?\nSTEVENSON: Nothing at all yet.\nMOBERLEY (joking): Oh, and I thought you were meant to be a botanist.\nSTEVENSON: I've not seen anything remotely like it.\nWINLETT: It looks tropical to me, like a gourd.\nMOBERLEY: Oh rubbish Charles. If it's from the late Pleistocene period, it can't be tropical. It's a few million years since this part of Antarctica was rainforest.\nWINLETT: Oh that's the accepted theory. Discoveries like this have destroyed accepted theories before now. Isn't that right, John?\n(Stevenson is far less casual about the situation than the others. Without even listening to Winlett, he hesitantly touches the pod a few times with his finger. Winlett tries to get his attention but he seems distracted and confused.)\nWINLETT: ...John?\nSTEVENSON: ...hmm? Sorry.\nMOBERLEY: Is something wrong?\nSTEVENSON: ...Don't you feel it?\nMOBERLEY: Feel what?\nSTEVENSON: I don't know - there's something... odd...something...you don't feel it?\nMOBERLEY (laughing): It must be that rice pudding you had for lunch!\n(Winlett laughs, but Stevenson doesn't. He steps closer to Moberley.)\nSTEVENSON: I'm not joking. ... It's alive. That's it. It's alive.\nMOBERLEY: Are you serious?!\nSTEVENSON: Yes.\nWINLETT: How can you tell?\nSTEVENSON: I don't know - but I'm certain that this is a living organism.\n(Moberley breaks the intense atmosphere.)\nMOBERLEY: ...Yes well I think we should have some coffee.\nWINLETT: Coffee and a game of three-handed crib. Come on!\n(He takes Stevenson around the shoulders and leads him off. Stevenson doesn't relax, and he turns back to look at the pod.)\nSTEVENSON: I'll transmit pictures to London, they might have some idea.\nWINLETT: John, come on!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n3, INT: WORLD ECOLOGY BUREAU - OFFICE\n(A man in a suit is getting a file from a cabinet. He is Richard Dunbar of the World Ecology Bureau.)\nDUNBAR: Sir Colin insists that I show you these photographs which have just been received from my expedition.\n(As the camera follows him, it shows that it is the Doctor whom Dunbar is talking to. He is sitting on Dunbar's desk and he seems more interested in his yo-yo than what Dunbar is saying.)\nDUNBAR: Personally, I don't think you can help us.\nDOCTOR: Don't you? Well...\n(Dunbar reluctantly hands him the file. Dunbar looks around uncomfortably.)\nDOCTOR: Do sit down, Mr. Dunbar.\n(Unable to sit in his own chair as the Doctor would be almost on top of him, he walks all the way around the far side of the desk and sits in the chair usually provided for the visitors.)\nDUNBAR: These pictures have baffled all the experts. The only reasonable explanation seems to be that the pod is from some extinct species of plant.\n(The Doctor spins around to face Dunbar, he sits in Dunbar's chair and there is a bang as he rests his boots on Dunbar's desk. He doesn't look up from the file.)\nDOCTOR: Have you considered an alternative explanation.\nDUNBAR: Name one.\nDOCTOR: Well...that it might have originated in outer space.\nDUNBAR (amused): My dear Doctor, if you've seen anything like that before, you must have a very powerful telescope.\nDOCTOR (unimpressed): Mr. Dunbar, how long is it since there was vegetation in Antarctica?\nDUNBAR: I thought you were the expert in these matters. Well as a matter of fact, that's one of the things our expedition is trying to discover. It was found fairly deep in the permafrost; say...20-30 thousand years under the ice...\nDOCTOR: Ssh. It might still be ticking.\nDUNBAR: What?\n(The Doctor suddenly seems interested and he stands up abruptly, walking around the desk.)\nDOCTOR: A time-bomb, Mr. Dunbar, a time-bomb. Are you in contact with the expedition?\nDUNBAR: My superior, Sir Colin Thackeray has a daily video link. Ten minutes of satellite time.\nDOCTOR: Good. Tell them to keep a constant guard upon the pod, and not to touch it until I arrive.\nDUNBAR: You're leaving immediately?\nDOCTOR: Why not? I've got my toothbrush.\n(He turns around and for some reason has a toothbrush in his hand. He starts to leave but ducks back in for a few more words.)\nDOCTOR: Remember, no touch pod - could be dangerous.\n(He shuts the door. Dunbar stares incredulously after him for a while, then turns to his desk and picks up a phone.)\nDUNBAR: Sir Colin? Dunbar here. That chap you called in from UNIT - is he quite sane?!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n4, INT: RESEARCH STATION - LABORATORY\n(Stevenson measures the pod with a pair of pincers. He looks worried about the measurement and mutters to himself. He gets up and goes to the door.)\nSTEVENSON: Charles?\nWINLETT (oov): Yes?\nSTEVENSON: Here a minute.\n(Winlett enters and they walk over to the table to look at the pod.)\nWINLETT: What's up?\nSTEVENSON: It's growing.\nWINLETT: Eh?\nSTEVENSON: It's grown five centimetres since this morning.\nWINLETT: Are you sure?\nSTEVENSON: Check it yourself if you don't believe me.\nWINLETT: But it doesn't seem possible.\nSTEVENSON: I knew there was still life there - I said so didn't I?\nWINLETT: But it's just a pod, I mean...no root system. How can it grow without feeding?\nSTEVENSON: Sunlight, Charles - ultra-violet radiation.\nWINLETT: But plants need nitrogen.\nSTEVENSON: I believe this is fundamentally different. ... We may be cultivating something that is going to...shatter all our ideas about plant growth.\nWINLETT: Yes, well er...don't get carried away John.\n(He gets up and starts to leave.)\nWINLETT: Remember what London said.\nSTEVENSON: What do you mean?\nWINLETT: That we leave this thing alone.\n(Stevenson looks annoyed and walks over to Winlett.)\nSTEVENSON: Until this Doctor character arrives, why should we? It's our pod.\nWINLETT: John, we're working for the World Ecology Bureau.\nSTEVENSON: Oh he's probably some old crank that Thackeray's dug up out of retirement! He'd have no more idea about the pod than we have.\nWINLETT: We'll soon find out, he's due in tomorrow.\nSTEVENSON: And who needs him. It's our discovery. The less said about it the better.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n5, INT: CHASE ESTATE - NURSERY\n(There is a shot of a large mansion. Inside, a butler, Hargreaves, is showing a man into a nursery. The man is Dunbar. He carries a suitcase. They approach the main part of the nursery, where a small man in a suit can be seen with his back to them. Hargreaves announces Dunbar.)\nHARGREAVES: Mr. Dunbar, of the World Ecology Bureau, sir.\n(Hargreaves leaves. Dunbar waits for the man to turn around. Harrison Chase, owner of the mansion, is a small eccentric man wearing a black suit and black gloves. Finally deciding to notice Dunbar, he walks towards him.)\nCHASE: I don't think I've had the pleasure. And what is your bureau doing about bonsai?\nDUNBAR: Bonsai, Mr. Chase?\nCHASE: Mutilation and torture, Mr. Dunbar. The hideous, grotesque Japanese practice of miniaturizing shrubs and trees. What is your bureau doing about that?\nDUNBAR: Well...I...\nCHASE: No answer. You are concerned about the fate of the blue whale, and the natterjack toad - and the loveliest, most defenceless part of creation; the great kingdom of plant life receives no protection at all.\nDUNBAR: We try to conserve all the endangered species.\nCHASE: I'm delighted to hear that, Mr. Dunbar. Of course you know of my concern...my mission: to protect the plant life of Mother Earth?\nDUNBAR: I do, Mr. Chase - which is why I've come to show you something. A totally new kind of plant.\n(Dunbar opens his suitcase and retrieves some photographs.)\nCHASE (angry): Hybrids! A crime against nature!\nDUNBAR: No, not a hybrid. It's a mysterious unidentified pod recently discovered by one of our expeditions.\n(He hands the suddenly interested Chase the photographs.)\nCHASE (excited): Where was this found?\nDUNBAR: There's a theory that it's floated through space from some other biosphere. The really important thing is, it may be still viable and able to germinate.\nCHASE: Mr. Dunbar. I asked you where this pod was found.\nDUNBAR: In the Antarctic. Now in our violent and uncertain world, Mr. Chase, anything could happen. Such a valuable specimen could easily disappear...for a price?\nCHASE: Where in the Antarctic? I should want to know the precise location.\n(Dunbar gets an envelope from his pocket and hands it to Chase. Chase walks over and picks up a column-shaped object, an intercom of some sort.)\nCHASE: Hargreaves?\nHARGREAVES (oov): Yes, sir?\nCHASE: You and Mr. Scorby please.\nHARGREAVES (oov): Certainly sir.\n(He puts down the intercom. He opens the envelope as Dunbar approaches behind him.)\nDUNBAR: X marks the spot.\nCHASE: Forethought and initiative, Mr. Dunbar, two excellent attributes. We shall meet again very soon to discuss your...remuneration.\nDUNBAR: You're very kind.\n(There is a knock on the door.)\nCHASE: Come.\n(Hargreaves enters with a tall, tough-looking man.)\nHARGREAVES: Yes, sir?\nCHASE: Hargreaves, show Mr. Dunbar out.\nHARGREAVES: This way, Mr. Dunbar.\n(They leave.)\nSCORBY: You wanted to see me, Mr. Chase?\nCHASE: Yes, Scorby. I'm sending you on a little errand, and I want you to take Mr. Keeler with you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n6, INT: RESEARCH STATION - LABORATORY\n(The pod sits in its place on the table. Winlett wakes up from a doze. He sips his coffee and puts the cup back down, resting his arm near the pod. He looks at it for a while, then slowly drops back to sleep. Suddenly the pod starts to crackle and it opens outwards. A long weed-like vine grows out from the pod and attaches itself to Winlett's arm! Winlett wakes up and is terrified. He struggles away from the table, seemingly in great pain, staggering and falling onto the ground.)\nWINLETT: Aaah...Derek...!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n7, INT: RESEARCH STATION - LIVING QUARTERS\n(Stevenson hears the scream and jumps off his bunk.)\nSTEVENSON: Was that Charles?\nMOBERLEY: What? What's happening?\n(They both hurry out to find Winlett.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n8, INT: RESEARCH STATION - LABORATORY\n(They find Winlett on the ground.)\nSTEVENSON: Charles?\n(Stevenson rolls Winlett over onto his back, and alarmingly Winlett's face is now green and his skin is completely rough! His unconscious eyes stare out into nothingness.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n9, INT: WORLD ECOLOGY BUREAU - OFFICE\n(In the near future, Sir Colin Thackeray talks to Dunbar.)\nTHACKERAY: This Telex from Stevenson, what do you make of it?\n(Dunbar picks up the piece of paper and reads it.)\nDUNBAR: 'Pod carries infection, Winlett seriously ill, Medicaid needed urgently.' Could have been more informative, Sir Colin.\nTHACKERAY: He probably doesn't know any more. I have ordered Medical Team to go to the base, but I understand the weather conditions are bad. It's bound to take at least a day or two.\nDUNBAR: The people from UNIT should be arriving now, perhaps they can help.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n10, EXT: RESEARCH STATION\n(A helicopter begins to land near the base. A short time later, with heavy snow falling, Moberley comes out to greet the Doctor and Sarah. Moberley and Sarah are dressed heavily, while the Doctor has not changed his attire at all. Everyone has to shout over the wind and the noise of the helicopter.)\nMOBERLEY: Hello! So you made it! Welcome to the loneliest spot on Earth. You must be the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nMOBERLEY: We were expecting someone much older.\nDOCTOR: Well I'm only 749, used to be even younger!\nMOBERLEY: Derek Moberley.\nSARAH: Sarah Jane Smith. The young Doctor's assistant.\nDOCTOR: How many of you live here?\nMOBERLEY: Anything up to a dozen, but of course we're down to three at the moment. Let's get inside...\nSARAH: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Where are the others?\nMOBERLEY: Out at the South Bend (?) not 60 miles away, measuring the ice caps, if they're getting this kind of weather they're welcome to it! Come on.\n(Much to Sarah's relief, they finally make it inside.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n11, INT: RESEARCH STATION - CORRIDOR\n(Sarah removes a glove and puts her frozen finger in her mouth to warm it up.)\nSARAH: How do you stand it?\nMOBERLEY: Oh, sometimes it gets quite warm. 10 degrees below freezing.\nSARAH: Crikey, I feel as though I've got frostbite already!\nMOBERLEY: I'll get you something hot to drink in a tick.\n(He turns to the Doctor.)\nMOBERLEY: Er, are you okay dressed like that, you don't seem to notice the cold.\nDOCTOR: I haven't come ten thousand miles to discuss the weather, Mr. Moberley; can I see the sick man?\nMOBERLEY: Yes of course, down this way.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n12, INT: RESEARCH STATION - SICK BAY\n(The now almost unrecognizable form of Winlett is lying on a bed. The Doctor and Stevenson stand nearby.)\nSTEVENSON: He seems to be conscious, but he hasn't spoken a word since last night.\nDOCTOR: What's his body temperature?\nSTEVENSON: Well that's the amazing thing. I've been trying to keep him warm but it's dropping hourly.\nDOCTOR: And the pulse rate?\nSTEVENSON: His body temperature is 46; his pulse rate is 18 a minute. I'm no medical expert, but on those figures he should be dead, shouldn't he?\nDOCTOR: I wonder.\n(The Doctor pulls back the sheet to reveal Winlett's body; no longer does he have human skin, and instead he is fully covered in green plant-like skin.)\nSTEVENSON: Good grief! It wasn't like that an hour ago.\nDOCTOR: Then it's accelerating. How long before a medical team arrives?\nSTEVENSON: Well it's difficult to say in these conditions. Hopefully tomorrow.\nDOCTOR: I don't think that's going to be soon enough, Mr. Stevenson.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n13, INT: RESEARCH STATION - LIVING QUARTERS\n(Moberley passes a cup of coffee to Sarah, who looks very cold.)\nMOBERLEY: There, that ought to warm you up.\nSARAH: Thanks.\n(She drinks some coffee.)\nMOBERLEY: Better?\nSARAH: Mm. So you say you just found this pod lying there empty.\nMOBERLEY: Yes, and Charles in that state. Now does that make any kind of sense to you?\n(An alarm goes off nearby.)\nMOBERLEY: Would you excuse me? Radio.\nSARAH: Oh sure.\n(He gets up.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n14, INT: RESEARCH STATION - SICK BAY\nSTEVENSON: Have you any idea what it could be, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes. That's why I came here.\nSTEVENSON: I thought you came here to see the pod.\nDOCTOR: Exactly - before anything happened. Unfortunately it already has! Where's the lab?\nSTEVENSON: I'll show you.\n(They leave.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n15, INT: RESEARCH STATION - LABORATORY\n(Moberley is on the radio.)\nMOBERLEY: Okay Mike, but try to get something moving, his condition is pretty desperate. Over.\nMIKE (radio): Understood. Out.\n(Stevenson and the Doctor walk in.)\nMOBERLEY: Bad news, John. That was Mike Wilson at South Bend. The medical team's turned back.\nSTEVENSON: What about Charles? Did you tell them how bad he is?\nMOBERLEY: They were in white out conditions and their Snow Cat's fallen intro a crevasse. But Mike is in touch with the Royal Marine Survival Team - they might be able to help. They'll try again as soon as the weather lifts.\nSTEVENSON: Well that'll be too late! He's dying! Isn't he Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No.\nSTEVENSON: I thought you said in the sick bay...\nDOCTOR: It's more serious than death, Mr. Stevenson. He's changing form.\nSTEVENSON: Changing form?\nDOCTOR: Yes. We need a blood test.\nMOBERLEY: I'm a zoologist - I could prepare a specimen slide if it'll help?\nDOCTOR: Yes it would help, thank you.\nMOBERLEY: Right.\n(He leaves. The Doctor has only one word for Stevenson. He leans in closer and stares at him.)\nDOCTOR: Pod.\nSTEVENSON: It's over here.\n(They move over and Stevenson picks up the tray with the opened pod on it. The Doctor examines it.)\nDOCTOR (quietly, but furious): Why did it open? Why?\nSTEVENSON: Well that...that could be my fault. It was frozen stiff when we took it out of the ice. I was certain there was still life there. I put in under a lamp and it started to expand.\nDOCTOR: Mr. Stevenson, what you have done could result in the total destruction of all life on this planet.\n(Stevenson stares back in disbelief.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n16, INT: RESEARCH STATION - SICK BAY\n(Moberley takes the blood sample from Winlett. He puts it down and looks at the monster his friend has become. His condition is even worse than before.)\nMOBERLEY: Charles? We're trying our best Charles. Help's on its way.\n(He gets up sadly and with one final look back, he leaves.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n17, EXT: ANTARCTICA\n(A pickaxe is digging in the ice. It is the Doctor, covered in snow. Sarah and Stevenson watch nearby.)\nSARAH: Doctor? Doctor, what are we looking for?\nDOCTOR: Are you sure this is the place, Stevenson?\nSTEVENSON: Yes, and if you told us what you were doing, perhaps we could help.\n(The Doctor doesn't even bother to look up. He keeps digging until he finds something in the ice.)\nDOCTOR: Yes! Just as I thought!\nSARAH: Another pod!\nSTEVENSON: How did you...Will there be any more?\nDOCTOR: No. They travel in pairs - like policeman.\nSARAH: What are we going to do with it - buy it a truncheon?\nDOCTOR: No. Take it into custody and keep it in the freezer.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n18, INT: RESEARCH STATION - LABORATORY\n(Night time, Stevenson puts the pod into a big freezer.)\nSTEVENSON: Well that ought to keep it cool.\nSARAH: Who sold you that, an Eskimo?\nSTEVENSON: I know a freezer seems superfluous out here, but we do need it to keep snow sample in - until they're analysed.\nMOBERLEY (oov): Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Hmm?\n(Moberley is looking in a microscope.)\nMOBERLEY: Take a look at this blood sample.\n(The Doctor goes over to look.)\nDOCTOR: How's Winlett?\nMOBERLEY: Winlett. He's barely recognisable. It's as if he's turning into some sort of a hideous monster.\nDOCTOR: That's exactly what is happening, Moberley.\nMOBERLEY: Yes but there must be an answer.\nDOCTOR: You can just increase the magnification...ah...yes! Take a look at that.\n(Moberley looks.)\nMOBERLEY: These aren't blood platelets?\nDOCTOR (to Stevenson): Do you recognise them?\n(Stevenson looks. He is shocked by what he sees.)\nSTEVENSON: Schizophytes.\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nSTEVENSON: I don't believe it. It's not possible.\nSARAH: Would someone mind explaining what these schizophytes are please?\nSTEVENSON: The smallest known living organisms. Plant bacteria.\nSARAH: Plant bacteria, in someone's bloodstream?\nDOCTOR: Interesting, isn't it. A human being whose blood is turning into vegetable soup.\nSARAH: Listen...\n(They hear the sound of engines.)\nMOBERLEY: That's very low by the sound of it.\nSTEVENSON: It's the medical aircraft. Quick Derek, get the landing strip (?) lights on.\nMOBERLEY: They won't see anything in this blizzard (?)\n(They go back into the living quarters, their voices hard to hear over the engine noise.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n19, INT: RESEARCH STATION - LIVING QUARTERS\n(Moberley and Stevenson are getting dressed to go outside.)\nSARAH: Should we come out and help you?\nMOBERLEY: No, John and I know our way around out there - it's easy to get lost.\nSARAH: Okay.\nMOBERLEY: You ready?\nSTEVENSON: Ready.\nMOBERLEY: Right.\n(They leave.)\nSARAH: Will they be able to help that man?\nDOCTOR: I don't know Sarah. He's halfway towards becoming a Krynoid.\nSARAH: Krynoid?\nDOCTOR: Yes. A progression of the pod.\nSARAH: So you recognised it.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I was fairly certain when I saw the photographs. Now I'm sure.\nSARAH: Well, what is a Krynoid? I mean, what does it do?\nDOCTOR: I suppose you could call it a galactic weed. Except it's deadlier than any weed you know.\nSARAH: In what way?\nDOCTOR: Well on most planets, the animals eat the vegetation, hmm?\nSARAH: Mmhmm.\nDOCTOR: On planets where the Krynoid gets established, the vegetation eats the animals.\nSARAH: But that's terrifying!\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nSARAH: Well how did it get through space?\nDOCTOR: An obvious question - I wish I knew the answer. Possibly their planet of origin is turbulent from time to time, that any internal explosions could cause surface matter to go shooting into space...\nSARAH: So what do we do about Winlett?\nDOCTOR: I'm thinking Sarah, I'm thinking.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n20, INT: RESEARCH STATION - CORRIDOR\n(From outside, Moberley and Stevenson help two other men into the shelter, directing them down to the living quarters. All four men are dressed heavily and covered in snow.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n21, INT: RESEARCH STATION - LIVING QUARTERS\n(Sarah goes to help; the two new men are shown to chairs. The Doctor doesn't bother to help.)\nMOBERLEY: ...into the chair.\nSARAH: ...let me take that.\nSTEVENSON: Come on, sit yourselves down.\nSARAH: Come on, sit down over here.\n(The two men are not the medical team though; it is Scorby and Keeler - on their 'errand'.)\nSTEVENSON: Get some brandy, Derek.\nMOBERLEY: Right.\nDOCTOR: Is this the medical team?\nSTEVENSON: They were flying a private plane.\nMOBERLEY: They just got themselves lost. Brandy.\n(He hands the two men cups. They thank him and drink it.)\nKEELER: Sorry to be such a nuisance.\nSCORBY: Yeah, we were nearly out of fuel when we saw your lights.\nSARAH: You were very lucky; lights are few and far between out here.\nDOCTOR: I'd like to take another look at the patient.\nSTEVENSON: What, now?\nDOCTOR: Now. Yes come on.\nSTEVENSON: You just relax and __?\nSCORBY: Alright, thanks.\n(The Doctor, Sarah, Moberley and Stevenson leave.)\nKEELER: Do you think they swallowed it? If they start asking too many questions...\nSCORBY: Why worry, Keeler? What can they do?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n22, INT: RESEARCH STATION - SICK BAY\n(The four arrive in the sick bay to find Winlett totally transformed; a big green pile in only a vague human shape.)\nSARAH: That's horrible. Horrible!\nDOCTOR: The process is almost complete.\nMOBERLEY: And we can do nothing except just watch it happen.\nDOCTOR: There is something you can do but it's drastic.\nSTEVENSON: Well, what?\nDOCTOR: Amputate the arm.\nMOBERLEY: What good what that do? Can't you see the infection's all over his body?\nDOCTOR: Yes well the arm's the source of the infection - it might stop it spreading.\nMOBERLEY: You say might, what you mean is you don't know!\nDOCTOR: Well of course I don't know! But it would give you a breathing space while you try and find an antidote - that's a chance worth taking isn't it?\nMOBERLEY: And who's going to perform this operation?\nDOCTOR: Oh you are, Moberley, you're the only one who can.\nMOBERLEY (horrified): But I'm not a surgeon...What about you, you're a doctor!\nDOCTOR: You must help yourselves.\nSARAH: He's not a doctor of medicine. Stevenson's a botanist, you're a zoologist. Ask yourself who is most qualified among us.\nMOBERLEY: But, I can't operate on Winlett - it's absurd!\nSARAH: Oh at least you could try. You studied physiology, you know how to handle a scalpel...\nMOBERLEY: To dissect dead specimens, yes, but Charles is a human being.\nSARAH: He won't be much longer if you don't operate! (to Stevenson) Look, have you got a medical kit?\nSTEVENSON: We have a full medical kit in the lab.\nSARAH (to Moberley): Well? Well what about it? You're his last chance!\nSTEVENSON: Derek, we'll help you in every way we can.\n(Moberley is clearly horrified at what they are asking him to do. There is a long silence while he decides.)\nMOBERLEY: I'll...do my best.\nDOCTOR: You're a good man, Moberley. Come on, let's get started.\nSARAH: Right.\n(They leave. After they have all gone, the being that was once Winlett slowly sits up. It looks around the room - only one of its eyes can be seen clearly.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n23, INT: RESEARCH STATION - LABORATORY\n(Some solutions and medical instruments have been prepared. Moberley picks up the tray with the equipment on it.)\nMOBERLEY: I'll take these down to the sick bay and start setting up.\nDOCTOR: You'll need more lights in there.\nSTEVENSON: I can fix that.\nDOCTOR: Winlett's still got a chance.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n24, INT: RESEARCH STATION - CORRIDOR\n(Moberley walks down the corridor heading for the sick bay. He sees something and stops.)\nMOBERLEY: Charles.\n(The creature is in the shadows, leaning against the wall. It makes a sort of screeching sound. Moberley puts down the equipment and walks towards his old friend. But the creature grabs him around the neck with tremendous power and throttles Moberley to the ground...)\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The text is a short story about a group of scientists who are stranded on a remote island. One of the scientists, Winlett, is infected with a deadly disease and is in a critical condition. The other scientists, Moberley, Stevenson, and Sarah, try to find a way to save him. They decide to amputate his arm, which is the source of the infection, in the hope that it will give them a breathing space while they try to find an antidote. However, Moberley is reluctant to perform the operation, as he is not a surgeon and it is a drastic measure. The other scientists convince him that he is the only one who can do it, and he reluctantly agrees. The operation is successful and Winlett is saved. However, the creature that was once Winlett slowly sits up and looks around the room. It is unclear what happens next, as the text ends with Moberley being strangled by the creature.</s>package com.example.android.miwok;"

She looks around. He reappears)\nConnor: You know... It makes sense. Guilty conscience\nElena: You're not here. I'm... I've got to be dreaming\nConnor: Then how do you know that I'm not here?\nElena: Because you're...\nConnor: Come on. Say it\nElena: Because you're dead\nConnor: Yes. I am. Was that the first time that you've taken a human life?\nElena: You're a ghost. It's got to be... You're a ghost. That's... that's what's happening right now. Jeremy. Jeremy!\n(He wakes up)\nElena: You're a ghost. You're haunting me. You're a ghost. You're haunting me\nConnor: Can a ghost do this?\n(He strangles her from behind. She punches him with her elbow and then pushes him on the table. He gets up and comes back toward her. She takes a knife and stabs him in the neck. She removes the knife. It was Jeremy)\nElena: Oh my god! Oh! Jer! Jer!\n(He collapses)\nElena: Jer! Jer! No, no, no! No! No. No, Jer! Jeremy!\n(Jeremy is on the couch, still dead. Elena and Damon are with him)\nElena: I can't believe this happened. What... what am I going to say to him?\nDamon: Thanks for not ditching the family ring after it drove Ric crazy? You should have called Stefan\nElena: I don't want to talk to him. He's been lying to me, and hiding things from me. He compelled Jeremy to forget God knows what\nDamon: In all fairness, I mean, I think you killing him kind of trumps that. I mean, you should have called Stefan\nElena: I don't trust him right now, Damon\n(Stefan enters)\nStefan: Hey\nDamon: P.S... I called Stefan\nStefan: What happened? Why didn't you call me?\nElena: I just... I need to go upstairs and shower. Clean all the blood off my hands\n(She goes upstairs and Jeremy wakes up)\nStefan: Welcome back. How you feeling?\nJeremy: What happened?\nDamon: Long story. Buy the e-book\n(Stefan goes in Elena's bedroom. She's there)\nStefan: Elena? Hey. Listen, I know you're still upset about yesterday, and I get it. Believe me. But just... let me help you\nElena: I don't want your help right now, Stefan\nStefan: But you'll accept Damon's?\nElena: Don't make this about Damon! You've been working with Klaus doing God knows what, and don't insult me by trying to deny it\nStefan: Listen, it's not what you think, ok?\nElena: I don't know what to think but I do know that I don't want to talk to you and I don't really want to be around you right now\nStefan: Look, please, just...\nElena: No. This is my brother's blood on my hands, Stefan. I stabbed him in the neck last night, so forgive me if I'm not in the mood to listen you try to talk your way out of this\n(She goes in the bathroom and slams the door)\n[Lockwood's Mansion]\n(A hybrid pours alcohol to Haley. Tyler enters and she looks at him, smirking)\nTyler: You're still going? I drank enough last night. And then I slept, which is what you guys should have done\nHybrid: We're just paying our respects to Dean\nTyler: That's great, Chris, but would you pay them at a bar instead?\nHaley: Don't be mad. We're celebrating our fallen hybrid friend\n(She makes him drink but he doesn't want to. She wipes his mouth with her finger and then sucks her finger, looking at him. Klaus enters)\nKlaus: Well, don't let me interrupt\nTyler: I didn't know you were here\nKlaus: Clearly. Thought I'd just pop 'round to celebrate Dean's successful retrieval of the vampire hunter. Yet when I arrived, I learned that not only was Dean unsuccessful, but that Elena killed the hunter\nHaley: Well, maybe if you had let Dean use force on Connor instead of sending him in on a suicide mission...\nKlaus: Maybe you should mind your business, wolf girl\nTyler: What do you care if Connor's dead, anyway?\nKlaus: I have my reasons. They have ceased to matter. Cheers\n(He drinks. Someone knocks on the door. Tyler opens. It's Caroline. She gives him a box)\nCaroline: Brought your stuff. Old laptop, your Jersey, the charm bracelet\nTyler: Car... This isn't a good time\nCaroline: Just take it\n(Klaus rejoins them)\nKlaus: Caroline. By the break-up drama unfolding before me, I assume you've met Haley. All right, come on, let's go. Let's leave them alone. Your talents are needed elsewhere\nTyler: For what?\nKlaus: I think you've got more important things to deal with, mate\n(He leaves, his hybrids following him. Caroline looks at Haley and closes the door. Then she smiles do does Haley)\nCaroline: Do you think he bought it?\nHaley: Hell, I bought it\nCaroline: Thanks for the head's up that he was here, Haley\nTyler: You girls are good liars\n(Then he kisses Caroline and Haley looks at them)\n[Gilbert's House]\n(Elena is in the shower. Suddenly, the water becomes blood. She looks at the water but it's normal. She looks ah the shower and there's blood. She takes a towel and gets out)\n(Damon is in the kitchen, cleaning. Stefan enters)\nDamon: Where'd Jeremy go?\nStefan: School. Bonnie has him volunteering for some occult exhibit\nDamon: Or maybe he didn't want to linger in a house where his sister just jammed a knife in his neck\n(Stefan's phone rings. He looks at it)\nStefan: It's Klaus\nDamon: Ooh, time to face the music, pay the piper, dance with the devil\nStefan: You know, I'm glad you find this amusing. If he finds out I told you about the cure, he'll kill both of us\nDamon: Quit avoiding him. You're being shady. Shady people get outed\n(Stefan answers)\nStefan: I don't want to talk about it\nKlaus: Well, I can't imagine why, what with you ruining all my plans for a hybrid-filled future\nStefan: Well, it wouldn't happened if you hadn't sworn me to secrecy\nKlaus: Life's full of ifs, Stefan. Let's extenuate the positives, shall we? The hunter was one of five. We'll find another. It may take centuries, but we've got nothing but time, right?\nStefan: You're using your calm voice today. Who's getting killed?\nKlaus: Not you, if that's what you're worried about. But I am concerned about your beloved. Have the hallucinations started yet?\n(Stefan looks at Damon)\nStefan: What do you know about that?\nKlaus: I'll tell you. Where you are?\nStefan: I'm at her house\nKlaus: How convenient. So am i\n(He arrives at the house and knocks on the door)\n(Stefan opens the door and goes out)\nKlaus: You know, this would all be a lot more civilized if I was just invited inside\nStefan: Bad enough I'm out here talking to you. What do you know?\nKlaus: I killed the Original five hunters, remember? When one kills a hunter, there's a bit of a consequence\nStefan: What kind of consequence?\nKlaus: Hunters were spelled by witches to kill vampires. If you prevent one from fulfilling his destiny, then he'll take you down with him\nStefan: What do you mean? Connor's dead\nKlaus: I mean, Connor's death won't prevent him from making Elena his final vampire kill. She'll need to come with me now. I'll lock her up; keep her away from any sharp, wooden objects\nStefan: She's not going anywhere with you\nKlaus: But if we leave her alone, she'll take her own life before the day is out\nStefan: She's stronger than that\nKlaus: Is she? Believe me, it's for her own good\n(Elena is in her bedroom, dressing up. She looks at herself in the mirror and then opens a drawer. Connor is behind her. She surprised and turns herself. He touches the blood on his neck)\nConnor: Would you like some? You seem to enjoy it when you drink from me\nElena: I wasn't myself. I was angry\nConnor: Were you yourself when you snapped my neck with your bare hands?\nElena: You staked me!\nConnor: 'Cause you're a monster and you deserve to die. Admit it!\nElena: No\n(She enters the kitchen. Damon's there but when he gets up, it's Connor)\nElena: Damon...\nConnor: Decomposition starts in the first 24 hours. I'm rotting in an unmarked grave because of you\nElena: No!\n(She runs and Damon looks at her)\nDamon: What's wrong? Elena!\n(She gets out. Klaus turns himself. He takes her and disappears. Damon comes out and looks at Stefan)\n[Mystic Falls' High School]\n(Jeremy looks at the tattoo on his hand. Matt rejoins him)\nJeremy: Hey, do you see anything on my hand? What if I told you I saw the beginning of a mark like Connor's?\nMatt: Are you serious?\nJeremy: It showed up after he died. He told me that I was a potential; that that's why I could see his mark\nMatt: So what does that make you, like the next chosen one or something?\n(April rejoins them)\nApril: Hey, guys\n(She's holding a big roc)\nMatt: Hey April\n(Shane's there too)\nShane: Way to let her do the heavy lifting. I found her wandering the hallways with this. Just teasing. I'm the guy who wrangles all the freaky stuff, Atticus Shane. Please, call me Shane, I beg you. Thank you guys for helping, I really appreciate it. Y'all get free admission to my free exhibit\n(He smiles and leaves. April look at them)\nApril: Why does he look so familiar?\nJeremy: No idea\nApril: Hey, um, have you guys seen Rebekah? She said she was going to help me look into what caused the explosion at my dad's farm, and then she just...\nMatt: Disappeared, yeah, I know\n[Gilbert's House]\nBonnie: You lost her?!\nDamon: Well, \"lost\" is a very strong word. We just technically don't know where she is\nStefan: I'm more worried about what Klaus said about this hunter's curse\nBonnie: How does Klaus even know about this?\nDamon: How does Klaus know anything? The guy's like a billion year's old\nStefan: He said it was a witch's curse\nBonnie: You know if I could do anything to help, I would, but I...\nDamon: But nothing. Wave your magic wand, hocus pocus, be gone, hunter, ghosts, whatever\nBonnie: The spirits won't let me do the magic I need to break the curse. But I can ask Shane for help. He knows everything about everything\nStefan: Great. You two do your thing\nDamon: Where you going?\nStefan: To get her back\n(He leaves)\n[Klaus' Mansion]\n(Chris opens the door to a room and Klaus enters with Elena, holding her)\nElena: Let go of me!\nKlaus: Certainly\n(He lets go of her)\nKlaus: I apologize for the lack of windows. It's to preserve the art. And, of course, to prevent you from taking off your daylight ring and burning yourself to death in the sun\nElena: I'm not going to kill myself. I would never do that\nKlaus: Oh, but you'll want to. I did. Problem is, I'm immortal\nElena: You went through this?\nKlaus: Yes, I did. For 52 years, four months and nine days. I was tormented... In my dreams. My every waking moment. Relentless, never-ending torture. It was the only period of my life when I actually felt time\nElena: So you knew that this would happen if Connor died. That's why you got involved. Did Stefan know, too?\nKlaus: All he knew was that the hunter had to be kept alive. You should have listened to him when he said he had it covered, love\nElena: What else does Stefan know?\nKlaus: Well, that's one of life's little mysteries, isn't it?\nElena: How did you make it stop?\nKlaus: I didn't. Eventually it just stopped. The hallucinations tend to appear in strange forms. Don't say I didn't warn you\n[A road]\n(Stefan is on the phone with Caroline)\nStefan: He's got Elena. I need Tyler to get the other hybrids away so I can get her out. I know I'm probably asking the impossible, but...\nCaroline: Actually... You're not\n[Lockwood's Mansion]\n(Stefan is in the living room with Tyler and Caroline)\nTyler: Haley is the one that helped me break the sire bond. She showed me what to do. How to help. When she showed up here, I thought it was just coincidence. But it turns out she's been helping one of them. Her friend Chris. And she came to help us get the rest of them out from under Klaus\nStefan: So... Are you telling me that Chris isn't sired anymore?\nCaroline: That's exactly what he's telling you\n[Klaus's Mansion]\n(Chris enters Elena's room with some stuff)\nChris: Clothes, toothbrush. Klaus said you're going to be here until he figures out where to put you\nElena: Just please go away\n(Chris leaves but Connor appears)\nConnor: I can't. I'm going to be with you forever. A constant reminder of what you've become. So tell me. How did it feel to drain the life out of me?\nElena: It was horrible. It was the worst thing that I've ever done\nConnor: You're lying\nElena: No, I'm not\nConnor: Yes, you are. Tell the truth\nElena: I am telling the truth\nConnor: You're lying\nElena: Fine! I liked it. I loved the taste of your blood. Are you happy?\nConnor: I'm not happy, Elena. I'm dead. Did you know I had a family? A brother? Parents\nElena: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry\nConnor: Are you sorry about your parents? It's your fault they died\nElena: Don't\nConnor: They ran off Wickery Bridge with you in the car, but they weren't supposed to be there, were they? They died because of you. You know I'm not going to stop until you've taken your last miserable breath\nElena: I'm not going to let you do this to me\nConnor: Then get rid of me. Kill yourself. You never wanted to be a vampire in the first place. Now look at what you've become. A monster. And you deserve to die. You don't want to listen to me? Fine\n(Katherine appears)\nKatherine: Then how about you and I have a little chat\nElena: Katherine?\nKatherine: Did you miss me?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Mystic Falls' High School]\n(It's professor's Shane exhibit)\nShane: You're looking at what people believe to be the world's first tombstone. This item was donated to Whitmore college last month\n(April, Matt and Jeremy are listening)\nApril: Oh, I just remembered how I know him. Through my dad\nMatt: That guy knew your dad?\nApril: Yeah. He taught a theology seminar at Whitmore last year\nShane: ...belonged to a very powerful witch. A witch so powerful, in fact, that Silas... That was his name... Created a spell that would grant him... Immortality. Now legend says that Silas did the spell with the help of a lady witch who loved him, a woman named Qetsiyah. Sadly for Qetsiyah, Silas wanted to give immortality to another woman. So Qetsiyah killed her and buried Silas alive, leaving him powerless, immortal, and alone. This might actually be the origin story of hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\n(Damon and Bonnie are here)\nDamon: You got this?\nBonnie: Yeah. I'll bring him to you\nShane: Now it's said that Silas wants to rise again. Regain his power. Wreak havoc on the world. Maybe we should be afraid. Or maybe it's all a bunch of crap and that's just an old rock. All right, listen, enjoy exploring the exhibit. I'll be around to answer any questions. Thank you for coming\n(He rejoins Bonnie)\nShane: Hey. You made it\nBonnie: Nice cautionary tale. Qetsiyah sounds like a bad ass\nShane: Nothing compared to Silas\n[Klaus' Mansion]\nKatherine: Ugh, don't you ever stop crying? Poor Elena, always the victim. Except now you're a killer. What does Stefan think of the new you?\nElena: Shut up\nKatherine: The girl he fell in love with is gone, you know. You're like me now. Maybe worse\nElena: I made a mistake. I can do better\nKatherine: No. You can't. You're a vampire. You'll kill again. It'll change you, and it'll keep changing you until you're just like me\nElena: I am nothing like you\nKatherine: I was you before you even existed. And when Stefan knew the real me... He hated me. Now he's going to hate you, too. Well, at least you still have Damon\nElena: Shut up!\n[Mystic Falls' High School]\n(Damon is sitting in Alaric's classroom, at his desk. He takes a bottle in a drawer and drinks)\nDamon: You're missing all the adventure, pal\n(Bonnie and Shane enter)\nBonnie: Shane, this is my friend Damon. He's kind of an expert on this stuff, too\nDamon: I audited your class. It's very enlightening\nShane: That's right, I remember you. What's your specialty?\nDamon: The origin of the species\nShane: Oh, I think Darwin would arm wrestle you for that distinction\nDamon: Not that species\nShane: You're into the monster stuff. All right, awesome\nDamon: I was kind of hoping that you might have stumbled upon this at some point... Maybe\n(He gives him a paper. Shane opens him. Bonnie looks at him)\nShane: This is the hunter's mark. Where did you get this?\nDamon: Came to me in a dream. You know anything about the hunter's curse?\nShane: Why, you got a dead hunter in the trunk of your car or something?\nDamon: Metaphorically speaking\nShane: Legend says that if a hunter is killed by that which he hunts, then that person will be cursed to walk the earth and torment them till...\nBonnie: Until...\nShane: Until a new hunter's awakened and their legacy's passed on. They're called \"potentials\"\n(Damon takes his phone)\nShane: Listen, I have a bunch of research on it, why don't I go grab it for you\nDamon: That would be great. Hey, thanks\n(Shane leaves)\nBonnie: How are we supposed to find a potential hunter?\nDamon: Yeah, about that...\n(He's on the phone)\nDamon: Little Gilbert. Your services are needed\n[Klaus' Mansion]\n(Chris is in the living room with Tyler and Stefan)\nTyler: Thanks for meeting us\nChris: Yeah, well, make it fast. Klaus will be back soon\nTyler: No, he won't\n[Mystic Grill]\n(Klaus is at the bar, drinking wine. Caroline rejoins him)\nCaroline: Place looks pretty good considering your hybrid got blown up in it\nKlaus: Caroline. To what do I owe the pleasure?\nCaroline: I want you to give Elena back\nKlaus: Ahh. They sent you to sweet talk me. Well, good form, but I'm afraid I can't do it\nCaroline: Why not?\nKlaus: She needs my help. Look, I'm not going to burden you with the gory details. I know you have enough on your plate already\nCaroline: That's none of your business, actually\nKlaus: Yes, well, just know that if Tyler was still sired to me, he never would have hurt you. I wouldn't have let him. Can I at least offer you a drink?\nCaroline: Yeah. Thanks\n(He smiles)\n[Klaus' Mansion]\n(Stefan and Tyler are still there)\nStefan: All you need to do is give me access to Elena and I'll take it from there\nTyler: Please, man. Help us, and then you can disappear. You'll be free\nChris: Yeah, until Klaus sends one of his other hybrids after me\nTyler: Haley and I got your back. We'll make sure nothing happens\n(Elena has her eyes closed. Katherine has reappeared)\nKatherine: You were such a good girl when you were a human. Always willing to sacrifice yourself for your friends. Except, weren't they usually the ones that ended up getting hurt?\nElena: I never wanted that\nKatherine: Bonnie lost her grams because of you. Her mom almost turned into a vampire because of you. You know, she probably secretly hates you. Did you ever think of that? I bet she'd be relieved if you were gone\nElena: I'm not going to kill myself\nKatherine: Why not? Your very existence brings people nothing but pain. I mean maybe it was worth it when you were worth it. But you're nothing now. You're a monster, Elena. You deserve to die\n(Chris rejoins the 2 hybrids guarding Elena)\nChris: Klaus said you two have to go to Tyler\nHybrid: Why\nChris: Something about his girl Caroline. I'll take over here\n(He looks at the hallway. Stefan rejoins him. Chris gives him the key)\n(Elena is sitting on the floor. Stefan enters)\nStefan: Elena. Hey\n(She sees Connor instead of Stefan)\nElena: No. No, no, no\nStefan: Hey, it's me\nElena: No, stay... Stay away from me\nStefan: Let me help you\n(She breaks a post from the bed and rushes over him)\nStefan: No, Elena, stop!\n(But she sees Connor instead. She pushes him against the wall and stabs him in the gut. She leaves)\n[Mystic Falls High School]\n(Bonnie and Damon are in the cafeteria)\nBonnie: How did I not know any of this stuff about Jeremy?\nDamon: The witch who loses her powers gets left out of the important conversations\n(Jeremy rejoins them)\nJeremy: Is everything ok?! Is it Elena?\nBonnie: We figured out how to help her. You need to kill a vampire\nJeremy: Oh, great. Give me a stake. I'll kill Damon right now\nDamon: Easy, van Helsing. We'll get you one. Don't worry\nBonnie: Before you do this, you need to know what you're getting yourself into\n(Damon's phone rings. He answers. It's Stefan)\nDamon: You can rest easy, brother. We figured out how to solve our little Elena problem\nStefan: Yeah, well, now we have a bigger one. I lost her\nDamon: What? Again?\nStefan: She's in bad shape. I tried to help her, but she attacked me. Listen, you go find her, all right? Talk her down. She'll listen to you. Just tell me what I need to do to end this\n[Mystic Grill]\n(Caroline is at the bar, looking at her phone. She receives a text from Stefan)\nCaroline: So here's the thing. I didn't just come here to try to get you to release Elena\nKlaus: You don't say\nCaroline: I came here to distract you so that Stefan could go to your house and break her out, which he did. And don't get mad, but then he lost her\n(He gets up quickly)\nCaroline: Klaus!\nKlaus: Caroline. You're beautiful, but if you don't stop talking, I will kill you\nCaroline: They figured out how to stop the hallucinations\nKlaus: Okay. You have 10 seconds to tell me\n[Middle of Nowhere]\n(Elena is walking, remembering everything that happened since her transformation. Connor appears next to her)\nConnor: Are you ready to die yet? You know it's your only way out of this\n(Katherine appears on her other side)\nKatherine: You can't take back what you did. It can never be undone. You're a monster and you deserve to die\n(She's at Wickery Bridge but she seems surprised. Katherine and Connor both disappear. She looks around and seems upset but resigned. She gets closer to the edge and looks at the water below. Her mother appears next to her)\nMiranda: It's ok, sweetie\nElena: Mom?\nMiranda: I know what you're going through. And it's ok. This bridge is... Where your life should have ended. Not just once, but twice. You were ready to die, remember?\nElena: I don't know what to do\nMiranda: Yes, you do, honey. You know exactly what to do\n(Miranda looks at Elena's hand and Elena does the same. She raises her hand and looks at her ring)\nMiranda: That's right. The sun will come up and this will all be over. It's the right thing to do, Elena. You know it is. Admit it\nElena: Because I'm a monster. And I deserve to die. I can't do this. I can't leave Jeremy\nMiranda: Jeremy is better off without you. Don't you see that?\nElena: But mom, he won't have anyone!\nMiranda: He'll have you. You'll be a ghost who helps him, not a monster who hurts him\nElena: You're... you're right. I... I... I'm sorry. Mommy, I didn't mean to disappoint you\nMiranda: Oh. You didn't. You were everything I ever wanted you to be. But you died. And you were supposed to stay dead\n(Damon arrives)\nDamon: Elena\nElena: Damon? How... how did you find me?\nDamon: Didn't take a genius to figure it out. The third time's a charm?\nElena: You were right, Damon. Vampires kill people. And Stefan was right, too. I can't live with myself\nDamon: Look at you. Being all glass is half empty. Let's just go talk about this before you do something stupid. Okay?\nConnor: The sun will be up soon. It's almost over\nDamon: Where's your ring? Where's your ring, Elena?\n[Lockwood's Mansion]\n(Chris is there with Tyler and Haley)\nTyler: You're doing a good thing, Chris\nChris: Yeah, well, let's see how fast a good thing could get me out of town\nHaley: Call me when you're safe, ok?\n(She embraces him)\nChris: Yeah\n(He opens the door but Klaus is there)\nKlaus: Going somewhere?\n(He strangles him and pushes him against the wall)\nKlaus: When I said don't let her out of your sight, what did you think I meant?\nTyler: It's not his fault! It's mine. I was distracting him. It's my fault she got away!\nKlaus: And maybe you should be the one to die for it\nHaley: No one has to die!\nKlaus: id I not say mind your business?!\nHaley: Tyler's covering for me. I'm the one that let her go\nTyler: Haley...\nHaley: You want someone dead, go ahead. Kill me. I'd rather die anyway then end up as one of your sired little bitches\nKlaus: Don't tempt me, little wolf\n(He looks at Chris)\nKlaus: Your existence is to serve me. To please me. Do you understand?\nChris: I'm sorry. I won't fail you again\nKlaus: No. You won't. Get out of here\n(Stefan enters and stakes him in the guts)\nHaley: No!\n(Haley is shocked. Jeremy enters with an axe)\nTyler: Jeremy?\n[Wickery Bridge]\nDamon: We need to get you inside\n(Connor appears)\nConnor: It's almost time\nDamon: What you're going through is a curse. We know how to break it, we just have to get you inside!\nConnor: Don't let him stop you. I know you want to. But you can't. Don't\n(Damon looks at the sky)\nDamon: Damn it, Elena!\n(He tries to catch her but he can't)\n[Lockwood's Mansion]\nTyler: What the hell, man?!\n(Klaus smiles)\nStefan: I'm sorry\n(Stefan looks at Jeremy. Jeremy kills Chris. Haley screams. Jeremy has blood on his face. He looks at his hand. His tattoo grows)\n[Wickery Bridge]\n(Elena opens her yes and looks above Damon's shoulder)\nElena: He's gone\nDamon: It's okay\n(Her skin starts to burn)\nElena: Damon?\n(He takes her and jumps in the water with her)\n[Gilbert's House]\n(Elena wakes up. She has her ring on her finger. She looks at it. Damon is sitting on her bed)\nDamon: Fished it out of the river for you. Little tip... Vampires hate to swim. How you feeling?\nElena: My head's clear. I can remember everything, but not like I lived it. Like it was a really bad dream. You saved me. Thank you\nDamon: Well, you know what they say about teenage suicide. Don't do it\nElena: I just can't believe that I almost...\nDamon: You weren't yourself\nElena: Yeah, but if it wasn't for you...\nDamon: I'm about to take a very... High and annoying road and tell you something. Because I know that you think Stefan's been lying to you. Which, yeah. He has. But this... rough patch that you two have been going through, it's not what you think. Everything that he's been doing, he's been doing for you. To help you. And after he kills me for telling you this, I want you to throw my ashes off of Wickery Bridge, ok? There may be a way out of this for you, Elena. There may be a cure\n[Lockwood's Mansion]\n(Haley is asleep on the couch. Tyler is sitting next to her, a bottle in his hand. Caroline enters)\nCaroline: Tyler\nTyler: It's just us. Paying our respects to Chris\nCaroline: Tyler... we didn't have a choice\nTyler: I told him we had his back. I told him if he helped us, he'd be free\nCaroline: We needed to help our friend.\nTyler: Yeah, we helped our friend by handing over another friend\nCaroline: Chris wasn't...\nTyler: Chris was a friend, Caroline. He's like me. He's part of my pack. All he wanted to do was be unsired by that disgusting piece of... How did you even get Klaus to agree to give up one of his hybrids?\nCaroline: I agreed to go on a date with him. I just thought that it might help keep up the ruse between you and Haley\n(He throws the bottle on the wall. Haley wakes up)\nHaley: What the hell is going on?\nTyler: Nothing. Nothing at all. Just celebrating the life of a fallen hybrid friend\n[Mystic Grill]\n(Damon sits at the bar)\nDamon: Bourbon. Make that two\n(Matt rejoins him)\nMatt: Still saving a spot for Mr. Saltzman, huh?\nDamon: I'd say I'm in the market for a new drinking buddy. You're not qualified\nMatt: I know that you don't like me. But I dug up some stuff about the explosion at the Young farm that I kind of need to tell someone about. So April mentioned that her dad knew that professor Shane guy. Which wouldn't be creepy, except he had all that info about the hunter's curse. And we live in a town where, you know, anybody who knows stuff is creepy until proven otherwise\nDamon: You're on the verge of impressing me. Drive it home\nMatt: I got the sheriff to dig up the pastor's phone records. Turns out, he made like a call a day to the same number the last month he was alive. And on the day the council got blown up at the farm, he called it ten times. The office of professor Atticus Shane\n[Whitmore College]\n(Shane and Bonnie are in his office)\nShane: Did your, uh, did your friend Damon, did he get everything he was looking for in my files?\nBonnie: Yeah. Thanks. I, um... I have to ask, how do you know all this stuff?\nShane: Bonnie... I have been around the world ten times over. I've studied every supernatural creature known to man. And for the record, witches are hands down the most powerful, so I'm in your corner all the way, I'm your biggest ally. But let me just say one thing. When your new hunter, and I know you have one... When he completes his mark, you're going to want to come to me. 'Cause I'm going to be the only one who can help. Trust me on that, ok? The only one\n[Gilbert's House]\n(Stefan is on the porch. Elena comes out)\nElena: I'm sorry that I stabbed you\nStefan: No, it's all right. I probably deserved it. So, um... Damon told me that he clued you in\nElena: You didn't kill him, did you?\nStefan: Nah, screw the lies and the secrets. We all want the same thing. We just have to work together for it\nElena: Stefan... Why did you send Damon to come look for me instead of you?\nStefan: I sent him because lately... It seems like he's able to get through to you in ways that I can't. You listen to him. You trust him. Even when you can't trust me\nElena: I didn't mean to not...\nStefan: Come on, Elena. I mean, after everything that we've been through... You can admit it\nElena: You have been so strong for me. Helping me. Fighting for that girl that chose you. The girl that I was when I died on the bridge. And I love you so much for wanting to find this cure, because I'd like nothing more than to get her back. Because the... The girl that she's become... That... That I've become, is different. Somehow. Darker. I... Who I am, what I want...\nStefan: Or... who you want?\nElena: Something's changed... Between Damon and me. Much more than it ever used to be. It's like... It's like everything that I felt for him before I was a vampire...\nStefan: It's been magnified. Your feelings for him have been magnified\nElena: I'm sorry. I don't want to lie to you\nStefan: You know, before, when I was the, uh... The ripper... I understood why you cared for him. I mean, I practically drove you to it. But now... I can't do this, Elena. Not anymore\nElena: I know\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  A summary of the preceding text is that Elena and Stefan have been through a lot together, and Elena has developed strong feelings for Damon. However, she is also aware that her feelings for Damon have been magnified since she became a vampire. She is sorry for lying to Stefan, but she cannot continue to hide her feelings for Damon.</s>package com.example.android.miwok;"

The gallery is empty aside from Meredith who is standing by herself)\nMVO: As doctors we're trained to skeptical because our patients lie to us all the time. The rule is: every patient is a liar until proven honest.\n(Cristina enters the gallery and gives Meredith a wry smile and Meredith smiles back. Cristina walks up to the window to peer and looks down into the surgery)\nMeredith: Why aren't you prepping for rounds and stealing all the good cases?\nCristina: Well why aren't you prepping for rounds and stealing all the good cases?\nMeredith (shrugs): No reason.\nCristina: No reason?\nMVO: Lying is bad. Or so we're told. Constantly, from birth. Honesty is the best policy.\n(Cristina sits down next to Meredith)\nMVO: The truth shall set you free. I chop down the cherry tree. Whatever.\nMeredith: I'm waiting for McDreamy.\nCristina: I'm avoiding Burke.\nMeredith: Why are you avoiding Burke?\nCristina: He thinks I moved in with him. Why are you waiting...\nMeredith (interrupts): McDreamy is doing me a favor. Burke thinks you moved in with him?\nCristina: Wait you're calling him McDreamy again?\n(Cristina shakes her head at Meredith)\nMVO: The fact is, lying is a necessity.\n(Trauma room where Meredith is sitting on a table as Derek draws out her blood)\nMeredith: Thank you for doing this. With the needles and the blood. They won't accept her without a full family history.\nDerek: I'm happy to get your mom into the clinical trial. Even with the needles and blood.\n(He stands up and they 'gaze' into each others eyes)\nDerek: All done. How's that feel?\nMVO: We lie to ourselves because the truth, the truth freaking hurts.\nMeredith: Feels good.\n(Cristina is standing in a hallway waiting for Meredith. Meredith walks up to her and they start walking down the hall together)\nMeredith: Burke thinks you moved in with him? What does that mean?\nCristina: Ok it's not important. You're calling Derek, McDreamy again.\nMeredith: It's nothing.\nCristina: All right, what are you doing?\nMeredith: What are you doing?\nCristina: Stop repeating what I say.\nMeredith: Stop asking me questions.\n(They stop and look out over the railing of the mezzanine and hear some banging. George is banging on a window of the hospital with Izzie standing next to him, arms crossed holding a leash with Doc on it.)\nGeorge (yells): Cujo has to go!\n(Intern locker room where the interns are getting for rounds. Meredith is sitting down on a bench, already in her scrubs with Doc laying next to her)\nIzzie: He peed on my bed. My bed, Meredith!\nMeredith (defensive): He's our dog!\nGeorge: No, he's not my dog. You two bought him, without even asking me.\nMeredith: We rescued him from certain death. (She pouts) Come on you guys.\nGeorge: I'm putting my foot down. Either the dog moves out or I do. Foot. Down. Now. Me or the dog, which is it?\n(Meredith looks down at Doc contemplating and then back up at George)\nGeorge (shocked): You hesitated! She hesitated!\nIzzie: You hesitated?!?\nMeredith: I didn't hesitate. I was thinking.\nGeorge: You have to think about it, fine! I'm moving out right now.\n(He heads to the door to exit the room but as he opens the door, Bailey is revealed standing there. He swivels back towards his locker)\nGeorge: Later. I'm moving out later because right now I have rounds.\n(Bailey walks into the room)\nBailey: Tell me that is not a dog.\nAll: It's not a dog.\n(Bailey's pager goes off)\n(Bailey is standing outside the emergency double doors with Cristina, George, Meredith, Alex, and Izzie. An ambulances double doors open up and paramedics start wheeling out a patient, including Tony the paramedic)\nTony: Rick Freeark. 29. Severed 3 fingers on his left hand. Controlled the bleeding in field. Vitals stable. Gave him 5 of morphine on the way in.\n(They all start wheeling the patient down the hallway)\nBailey: The fingers?\nTony: Had some trouble retrieving them so we took off. Rich behind us found them. They're iced and ready to go. 10 minutes out.\nBailey: Continue with IV fluids and start a course of antibiotics.\n(Bailey stops Cristina)\nBailey: Yang, wait outside for the fingers.\n(Cristina heads back out)\n(Rick's trauma room)\nRick: You can sew them back on right? Cause they sewed that guy's pen1s back on after his wife chopped it off, right?\nBailey: Penises and fingers. Like apples and oranges.\nGeorge: How did it happen?\nRick: I was loading my gear onto my truck for a gig and my hand got caught in the lift gate.\nAlex: You're a musician?\nRick: I play the friggin guitar. (to Bailey) You can sew them back on right? It's not that big of a deal right? Oh dude I better not be out of the band.\n(Trauma room, where now there are only scrub nurses and Derek checking on Rick's fingers. Cristina enters the room with Rick's detached fingers in a towel)\nDerek: Well the cuts look clean. That's good. Clean and severed makes reattachment easier. I'm not going to lie to you, if the surgery is successful; we're looking at a long recovery. Lots of physical therapy. (Rick looks pained at this) You smoke?\nRick: Why?\nDerek: Cigarette smoke constricts the blood vessels. I've seen really good grafts fail over a few cigarettes.\nRick: So what are you saying? I, I smoke a cigarette after my operation and boom my fingers fall off?\nCristina: No first they turn black and necrotic and then they fall off.\n(Derek smiles apologetically at Rick)\nRick: Well I don't smoke, so ...\nCristina (holding up one detached finger): Really? Cause judging by the nicotine stains, your fingers do.\n(Rick looks alarmed at the idea of having to give up smoking)\n(George is rifling through some charts at the nurses station when he hears a voice call out from a patient room)\nSophie: Anybody out there? Hello!\n(George shoots a glance to Nurse Debbie who is also at the desk)\nDebbie: Don't look at me! She had hip replacement surgery a month ago and was discharged last week.\nGeorge: Then why is she still here?\nDebbie: Because I am not a bouncer and this is not a nightclub! I am doing what I can (Richard walks up and Debbie walks directly to him) with extremely limited staff and resources and if you have a problem with that take it up with 'Chief!'\n(She storms off. You can hear Sophie sing now)\nSophie: Don't know why, there's no sun up in the sky ...\n(Richard shoots George a look)\nRichard: Mrs. Larson's got to go.\nGeorge: If she refuses to leave what can I do?\nRichard: She's 78 and non-ambulatory. You have the upper hand here. Use it.\n(Bailey, Izzie and Alex walk up to them)\nRichard: Karev, can I talk to you for a second?\n(He and Alex walk off to the side and he hands him an envelope)\nRichard: The results of your medical board exam.\nAlex: Thanks.\n(Richard walks off as Izzie looks on curiously. George dumps a bunch of charts into Izzie's arms and heads off. Bailey looks on disapprovingly. Alex walks back up to Bailey and Izzie)\nIzzie: Aren't you going to open it?\nAlex: Yeah, I'll open it.\n(George is entering Sophie Larson's room. An elderly yet very vibrant and energetic woman)\nSophie (sings): I'm weary, all the time.\n(George claps loudly)\nSophie: Oh, thank you. Thank you.\nGeorge: Ok, Mrs. Larson I'm Dr. O'Malley.\nSophie: Oh an Irishman! I love the Irish. They have a sparkle. You can see it in the eye and the swagger. Come on Dr. O'Malley, show me the swagger.\n(George looks slightly uncomfortable but swaggers half-heartedly up to Sophie's bedside)\nSophie: The eyes are right, but uh you'll have to work on the swagger.\nGeorge: Mrs. Larson...\nSophie: Call me Sophie. Now, be a doll and bring me a remote. (She holds up and shakes it in front of him) This one's busted.\nGeorge: Sophie, I can't bring you a new remote because you are no longer a patient at this hospital. Now according to your chart you have a room waiting for you at the Sugar Maple Nursing Home.\nSophie: I'm staying until my daughter's house is ready. She's converting her den into my bedroom. She's doing it a shade of pink. Now bring me a remote Irish. I'm going to sing until you get back. (She starts singing loudly) Can't go on. Everything thing I have is gone! (George holds out is hand and she slaps a remote into it) Stormy weather-\nGeorge: Coming right up.\n(He leaves)\n(Trauma room where a young Asian woman named Yumi sits on a bed continuously hiccupping. Yumi's Coach, Mr. Kamaji is also in the room)\nAlex: Ah Yumi Miyazaki. 22. She presented this morning with persistent hiccups.\nIzzie: She was given 50 chlopromazine which stopped them for a while but then the hiccups returned so she needs a surgical consult to rule out esophageal perforation.\nBailey: When did your hiccups start?\nMr. Kamaji: A few days ago. She doesn't speak English.\nBailey: Are you her boyfriend?\nMr. Kamaji: Her coach.\nAlex: Oh she's an athlete.\nMr. Kamaji: Ah, Yumi is a competitive eater.\nIzzie: Eating is a sport?\nAlex (nods): Miyazaki ... yeah, yeah. She's like a Rock star in Japan.\nIzzie: Again, eating is a sport?\nAlex (to Mr. Kamaji): Tell her I saw her on TV. Tell her that I'm an athlete too. I'm a wrestler.\nMr. Kamaji (in Japanese to Yumi): The young doctor wants you to know he's a wrestler. I think he's flirting with you.\n(Yumi gives Alex an appraising look)\nYumi (in Japanese to Kamaji): Tell him I eat little boys like him for breakfast.\nMr. Kamaji (to Alex): She wonders how a wrestler got smart enough to be a doctor. Most wrestlers she knows are dumb.\n(Alex and Izzie smile. Izzie more of a oh my god smile)\nAlex: Just tell her that she hasn't been hanging around the right gyms.\nBailey: How bout instead you tell her that persistent hiccup could be an indication of something much more serious. (To Alex and Izzie) Schedule an esophogram.\nMr. Kamaji: Oh she's competing this afternoon at the 'Taste of Seattle'. Can't you just give her a stronger dose of that drug? It seemed to work.\nBailey: Did the hiccups come back?\nMr. Kamaji: Yes, but...\nBailey: Then it didn't work.\n(She moves and starts to walk off, but stops suddenly clutching her stomach in pain)\nIzzie: Dr. Bailey.\nBailey: Be quiet.\nIzzie: Dr. Bailey, are you ok?\n(Bailey tries to shrug it off, but she still seems to be in pain)\nBailey: All right somebody page Addison Shepherd.\n(Izzie moves off quickly while Alex stays with Bailey)\n(Bailey is lying down being given an ultrasound by Addison in an exam room)\nAddison: There he is. Heartbeat's strong. Since there's no dilation or effacement, looks like nothing more than Braxton Hicks.\n(Bailey sits up)\nBailey: Except I know the mild concerned tone. I've used it myself from time to time.\nAddison: Sometimes false labor is the body's way of telling you to slow down.\nBailey: I'm a surgeon.\nAddison: I understand the realities of your job but you need to understand the realities of your pregnancy and take it easy. Is there anything I can do to help?\nBailey: Uh, yeah for starters you can help me get up off this table.\n(Izzie knocks on the door and enters)\nIzzie: Dr. Bailey. The GI lab has a couple of questions about Miss. Miyazaki's esophagram.\nBailey: Well let's go.\n(Bailey walks out of the room)\nAddison: Dr. Stevens.\n(Izzie stops following Bailey)\nAddison: Keep an eye on her today. Watch out for any painful contractions. More than 5 in an hour. Anything that could indicate pre-term labor. (Izzie shakes her head) The favor is not for me Stevens, you know that.\n(Izzie nods and walks off)\n(Patient room where a middle aged woman named Naomi Cline lies on the bed looking very happy. Meredith and Burke are at the end of Naomi's bed. Tom Cline, Naomi's husband is also in the room)\nMeredith: Naomi Cline. 43. Had her tricuspid valve replaced 3 years ago with a porcine valve, sir.\nBurke: Ah Naomi, surprised to see you back again so soon. Pig valve usually holds up 10 to 15 years. But yours seems to be degenerating a little too quickly for my comfort.\nNaomi: Oh, heart valve, schmart valve. (excited) I got married Dr. Burke! (She laughs) I found him. My true love. My 'you jump, I jump'. (Burke and Meredith exchange looks. She holds out her hand to show her wedding ring) Look. Isn't it beautiful? And look, look at that beautiful, beautiful man.\n(Meredith and Burke turn around to see a middle aged balding man named Tom Cline.)\nTom (uncomfortable): Heh. We ah meet in the grocery store.\nNaomi: Oh honey ...\n(She gestures for him to come be by her bedside)\nBurke: Oh, congratulations. It's good to see you so happy Naomi.\nNaomi: Yeah.\n(Tom comes by her bedside and Naomi becomes very affectionate)\nTom: So Naomi's heart valve, what does this mean?\nBurke: Well there's an underlying cause for your wife's valve failure that remains undiagnosed. Theories, Grey?\nMeredith: Rheumatic fever, chronic use of migraine meds- (A large bark from Doc in the hallway interrupts her) or IV narcotics could all cause uh valve disease sir.\nNaomi (smiling): Oh I don't use drugs. Don't need them. I've got Tom, he's my drug. Aren't you baby?\n(Meredith looks weirded out by Naomi's happiness)\n(Meredith and Burke are walking out of Naomi's patient room walking down the hall)\nMeredith: She's high Dr. Burke.\nBurke (chuckles): Oh, she's in love. She's happy.\nMeredith: Nobody is that happy. She's on drugs.\nBurke (sighs): Run a tox screen but Naomi doesn't strike me as a liar. If she says no drugs, then it's no drugs. You develop a sixth sense about these things.\nMeredith (shrugs): Everybody is a liar.\n(Doc barks loudly again from the hallway)\nBurke: Dr. Grey, is that a dog?\nMeredith (shakes her head): No.\n(Derek is with Rick in the trauma room.)\nDerek: Look, we need to keep this elevated ok?\nRick: Ok.\nDerek: I'll be back to check on you in a little bit.\n(Derek heads out of the room into the hallway where Cristina is dumping some waste into a waste bin. They start walking down the hall together)\nDerek: Yang, you were a little harsh in there.\nCristina: He was lying. Besides your harsh is another man's refreshing.\nDerek: Well he's in shock. The man's lost his fingers and his only remaining habit in one day. We need to be compassionate.\nCristina (looks upset): Compassionate?\nDerek: Yes. It's an emotion. Have you ever heard of it?\nCRISTINA: Oh, have you? (Derek looks shocked at Cristina's audacity) She's barely back on her feet and you've got her calling you McDreamy again. You know I was just telling the patient the truth. So you might want to try it sometime.\n(Cristina walks off)\n(George is standing on some shelves rummaging around a utilities room. Richard walks by but double backs when he realizes what George is doing)\nGeorge: Remotes. (He pulls out a stack from a box) More remotes.\nRichard: O'Malley?\nGeorge: I'm getting a remote for Mrs. Larson.\nRichard: What happened to the upper hand?\nGeorge: Have you met Mrs. Larson, sir?\nRichard: Why do you think she's been here this long? In a private room?\nGeorge (amused): She handled you, too?\nRichard: Well, she sang for the troops, you know.\nGeorge: Can't we just keep here until her the room in her daughter's house is ready?\nRichard: No we can't. Not on surgical service, anyway.\nGeorge: Oh, ok... but some other service?\nRichard: I'm the Chief, O'Malley. I can't condone turfing patients onto other services. You hear me O'Malley?\n(Richard walks off)\n(George is entering Mrs. Larson's room smiling)\nSophie: I'm ah, I'm missing my program Irish and I don't see a remote in that hot little hand.\nGeorge: I noticed that urine output has increased slightly since yesterday. I'm going to have to take you to gynecology to make sure you don't have a prolapsed uterus.\nSophie: Honey my uterus hasn't been an issue for 30 years.\nGeorge: I know, but it might be an issue now. ... You know one that could keep you here in the hospital for tests.\n(Sophie grins broadly and grabs the metal triangle in front of her for grip)\nSophie: You drive, I'll ride shotgun.\n(Izzie comes to the door as George prepares to move Mrs. Larson's bed)\nIzzie: You're not moving out, George.\nGeorge: Oh yes, I am. I gave an ultimatum. Threw dawn the gauntlet. I drew my line in the sand.\nIzzie: Well un-give, un-throw and un-draw.\nGeorge: A man does not give an ultimatum and then back down.\n(Izzie helps George move the bed out of the room and down the hallway)\nGeorge: Meredith had a choice and she chose the dog.\nSophie (shocked): A girl chose a dog over you?\nGeorge: Yes.\nIzzie: No.\n(Izzie and George stare at each other)\n(Hospital outdoor cafeteria. Alex is sitting at a table by himself looking over the envelope Richard gave him. There is also an unusually big pile of hotdogs sitting in front of him. He puts it away quickly as Cristina and Izzie come up and sit down at the table as well. Cristina also has a large plate of hotdogs)\nAlex: Are we gonna do this or what?\nCristina: Yeah, let's go.\n(George comes up running with his own plate of hotdogs)\nGeorge: Don't start without me.\nAlex: We're not gonna start if Izzie doesn't focus.\nCristina: Izzie, come on.\nIzzie (ignores this): What should I put on the flier?\nGeorge: I don't know.\nCristina: Destructive, aggressive, uh hell dog available.\nGeorge: That's not helping.\nCristina: Fine, uh playful, protective puppy needs loving home.\nIzzie (approvingly): Good.\n(Meredith comes with her own set of food and Doc on a leash. She sits down)\nMeredith: Hey, George.\nGeorge (looking down at his food): Don't talk to me! You'll only make me mad. You're gonna mess up my game and I'm in the zone.\nMeredith: Okay. (To Izzie): What are you doing?\nIzzie: Oh it's a flier that I'm gonna put it up...\nCristina (yells): Izzie, come on! George (yells at the same time): Izzie!\nIzzie: Okay! Keep your panties on!\n(Izzie picks up a stop watch as George, Alex and Cristina all prepare to have a hot-dog eating contest)\nIzzie: All right.\n(George picks up one of his hotdogs)\nCristina: No touching!\n(George puts down his hotdog making a face at Cristina)\nIzzie (struggling not to laugh): Go!\n(George, Alex and Cristina start wolfing down their hotdogs. Though Cristina opts for eating the actual hotdog meat first quickly, rather than bun and dog like Alex and George)\nMeredith (looks at the flier): You're advertising for a home for Doc? I said I would do it.\nIzzie: And you haven't and you won't. And I don't want George to leave.\n(She makes a funny face when she looks at George's eating)\nMeredith: Well at least put down he's not house-broken. (Izzie gives her a look) What? It's the truth.\nIzzie: Ok, so you want me to put the truth. Fine.\n(Cristina has now finished her hot dog meat and only left with the buns with she is now wetting down with water, mushing up and then stuffing into her mouth)\nIzzie: Vicious, hyper devil mutt is available. And will pee on the bed.\nMeredith: He's your dog too. We got him together.\n(She gives the others a weird look at their eating contest. It seems Cristina is winning, Alex followed closely behind, and George is pretty much screwed)\nIzzie: We got him together, please. He's not your dog either. He doesn't even know us. We are not home enough for him to know us.\n(Cristina stuffs the last of it down her mouth and shouts victorious. Though it's very muffled and hard to understand since she still has a mouth full of bread. Alex and George also protest muffled as she hasn't chewed it all down. Cristina stands up and starts gloating and making hand gestures)\nCristina: You want to be! You want to be me but you can't be me! You want to be me...\n(She stops abruptly and looks like she's gonna chuck)\nGeorge: Uh, oh.\n(She sits back down woozy)\nIzzie: Crap, she's gonna blow.\n(They all stand up quickly and run off, leaving Cristina sitting by herself trying not to throw up)\n(Patricia and Richard are walking down a hallway together. Patricia is reading from some papers)\nPatricia: The surgical floor has become a dumping ground for patients who aren't even surgical. We are overworked and exhausted. This makes for un...\nRichard (interrupts): The nurses again? Can't you do something about this? You used to be one of them. Don't you speak nurse?\n(Richard stops in front of the OR board)\nPatricia: That's why you don't get any respect from the nurses; surgical arrogance.\nRichard (huffs): I'm not arrogant.\nPatricia: You're killing them with that workload. Look at the board!\n(The board is absolutely filled)\nRichard: What? That's a beautiful board.\nPatricia: That's a crowded board. (She hands Richard the paper she was reading from) We need more nurses.\n(She walks off)\n(Exam room, where Yumi is lying down on a table undergoing an ultrasound. Izzie, Bailey, Alex and Mr. Kamaji are in there. Yumi is still hiccupping)\nBailey: Mr. Kamaji, this is probably what's causing her hiccups. (Izzie points to a screen) A tear in the lining of her esophagus.\nMr. Kamaji: Can you fix it?\nBailey: Yes, surgically the sooner, the better.\nMr. Kamaji: Ah, after the competition today her schedule is clear until March.\nBailey: No her schedule is clear now. She can't compete today. And if she enjoys the taste of solid food, I recommend giving up the sport for something a little less aggressive. Say boxing.\n(Yumi just lies on the table looking scared and at Mr. Kamaji to tell her what's going on)\nMr. Kamaji: I see. Could you give us some privacy please?\n(The three doctors all exchange looks and leave the room)\nBailey: Karev, get the translator up here. Let's make sure she's getting the whole truth.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Patient room where Rick is. Cristina comes in and finds Rick's band mates and friends in the room, smoking and drinking)\nBand Mate: Busted\nCristina: Put that out!\nBand Mate: Sorry.\nCristina: I gotta prep you for surgery. Can you ask your friends to leave?\n(The band mates hug Richard and leave. Cristina starts prepping Richard and notices a carton of cigarette's on his lap. Richard notices this and holds up the packet defensively)\nRick: I wasn't gonna light 'em. I was just holding them.\nCristina: Ok.\nRick: Seriously, take 'em. Throw 'em out.\nCristina: No you hang onto them.\nRick: Seriously, I wasn't going to smoke.\nCristina: Seriously, I don't care. Do what you want.\nRick: You don't think I'm going to be able to quit, do you?\nCristina: No. I don't.\n(George is walking down the hall when he stops suddenly hearing a voice)\nSophie (singing): I'm lonely all the time ...\nGeorge: Oh no.\n(He looks over at the nurses' station where Debbie is standing)\nDebbie: Oh yeah.\n(George opens the patient door apprehensively, not wanting to believe it)\nSophie: Irish. That nice lady doctor in gynecology said that since I had a hysterectomy back in '74, I don't have a uterus to prolapse.\n(George walks in and sits dejectedly on the couch seat in the room)\nGeorge (to himself): Damn it.\nSophie: I've been feeling a bit feverish. (George sits up quickly and grabs Sophie's chart of her bedside) A woman my age with a fever could be an indication of oh any number of awful diseases.\nGeorge (disappointed): They took your temperature an hour ago. It was normal. I am sorry Sophie, but I'm going to have to call your daughter.\nSophie: I'm telling you, I'm warm.\n(George walks over and places a hand on Sophie's forehead. She places her own hand over his and smiles)\nSophie: That must be one hell of a dog.\nGeorge: Excuse me?\n(George removes his hand from Sophie's forehead but she still holds onto it)\nSophie: With those eyes and those nice firm hands ... A girl who chooses a dog over you ... It must be one hell of a dog.\n(George smiles at Sophie)\n(Burke and Meredith are walking down a hallway together)\nMeredith: Mrs. Cline's tox screen and titer both came back negative. I was sure I was right about that.\nBurke (chuckles): Gonna have to adjust your world view Dr. Grey. There are people out there that don't lie.\nMeredith: Maybe.\nBurke: Although frankly, the drug use would've explained the valve failure.\n(They stop walking in the middle of some stairs)\nMeredith: So how do we proceed?\nBurke: Schedule Mrs. Cline for a surgery.\nMeredith (nods): Ok.\n(Meredith starts heading back up the stairs)\nBurke: Do you want to come over for dinner?\n(Meredith stops abruptly on a stair and turns around shocked)\nMeredith: What?\nBurke: Dinner. Our place. Mine and Cristina's.\nMeredith (still shocked): Why?\nBurke: You're Cristina's best-friend. I want her to feel welcome to have friends in our home.\nMeredith: Oh, so she moved in with you?\nBurke: Yes. (suddenly confused) Didn't she tell you?\nMeredith (forces a smile): Of course she told me. Why wouldn't she tell me? She's in, right? Which you know, I think is great.\nBurke: Right.\n(He heads off down the stairs leaving Meredith standing looking confused)\n(Derek is standing in front of an elevator revealing Cristina standing by herself. He walks in. Cristina avoids looking at him)\nDerek: Just came from Mr. Freeark's room. He's convinced that he won't be able to quit smoking. Says that you agree.\nCristina: No he asked my opinion. Want me to apologize?\nDerek: No I want you to go in there and tell him that you're wrong. That you're having a bad day. You're favorite uncle died of lung cancer and that every time you see a cigarette you freak out. Say whatever you need to say. Get him to believe that this about you not him. Because if he thinks he won't be able to quit, he won't. Then we shouldn't even do this surgery.\nCristina: Fine.\nDerek: What is your problem? I'm your boss. What's the matter...\nCristina (interrupts): No you're not my boss right now. We're in an elevator. That's your specialty right? McDreamy moments in elevators.\nDerek (warningly): Dr. Yang.\nCristina: You know just for a moment, I'm not Dr. Yang and you're not Dr. Shepherd. You're the guy who screwed up my friend. The guy who drove her to get a dog she can't keep. The dog she only got because her boyfriend lied to her about his wife.\nDerek (interrupts): I never lied to her!\nCristina: You know what I know a liar when I see one because I'm a liar. Fine you want me to lie to the patient. I'll lie.\n(The doors ding open and she leaves)\n(Alex walks back to the Yumi's exam room with a translator. He looks in the room but it's empty)\nAlex: Yumi?\n(He walks out and to the closest nurses' station)\nAlex: Hey, the translator is here. Where's the patient Miyazaki?\nNurse: She left with her friend about 20 minutes ago.\nAlex: She wasn't discharged.\nNurse: Sorry, we're short staffed. I assumed someone else had done the paperwork.\n(She leaves)\nAlex: Damn it.\n(Rick is in a hallway banging against a vending machine)\nRick: Come on. Damn it. Uh! Uh.\n(Cristina walks down the hall and rushes up to him)\nCristina: What are you doing out of bed?\nRick: I gotta get a candy bar, man.\nCristina: Uh, you're on morphine. You're about to have surgery and you can't eat. Mr. Freeark, please.\n(She tries to move him down the hall)\nRick: My Dad's Mr. Freeark. He's gotta a comb over and ah, and an annoying wife named Kimberley so-\nCristina (interrupts): Rick. Listen. Earlier I was out of line.\nRick: No you got me to think. I don't want to be a guy, sitting in a bar with a stump for a hand. Having a smoke 10 years down the line bragging about how I used to play better than Dave Navarro.\nCristina: Yeah, you don't wanna be creepy, bitter guy.\nRick: Here's the thing. My last cigarette was this morning. Only, I didn't know it was my last cigarette.\n(Cristina and Rick are standing outside the hospital where Rick is having what looks like to be a very gratifying cigarette. Derek notices this and walks outside and hits against the glass)\nDerek (to Cristina): What the hell do you think you're doing?\n(Cristina has a look on her face that says 'oh sh1t')\n(OR where a surgery is being performed. Meredith and Cristina are both standing at the edge of the gallery with cups of coffee as all the seats are taken)\nCristina: McDreamy's being McDouchey. He's making me stand at the back of the O.R while he re-attaches Rick's fingers. I can't even touch a retractor. I hate him.\nMeredith: Truth. Did you move in with Burke or not?\nCristina (sighs): I told him I moved in with him. I'm keeping my old apartment.\n(Meredith turns around and gives her a look)\nCristina: What? I sleep with Burke every night. My clothes are there. So I still have my apartment, big deal.\nMeredith: You have to tell him.\nCristina: Actually I don't.\nMeredith: So I'm supposed to go to dinner at your fake apartment with the guy you fake live with?\nCristina: Oh, I would never have you over to dinner with Burke. That's weird.\nMeredith (spins around instantly): This is my point. Stop with the lying.\nCristina (whispers accusingly): And you're being honest? That last time you called him McDreamy you were all a-twitter with love.\nMeredith: We're just friends.\nCristina: Uh huh.\nMeredith: We are.\n(Infectious Diseases department. George is there with Mrs. Larson talking with an ID resident who is looking through Mrs. Larson's chart)\nResident: West Nile virus. Are you kidding me?\nGeorge: No, look at her. She's feverish. She's much weaker than she was this morning. She could be de-compensating.\n(Sophie tries to look sickly and coughs)\nResident: She's been here for a month, Dr. O'Malley. You seen any mosquitoes in this hospital lately?\nSophie: Oh, such a handsome young man ... (The resident gives her a weird look) Those chocolaty eyes ...\nResident (tries not to smile): In order to test you Mrs. Larson, we'd have to do a spinal tap.\nSophie: Will you be doing it?\nResident (tries not to look off put by the idea): Yes, ma'am.\nSophie: Well then, call me Sophie.\n(The ID resident moves to George's position to wheel Sophie's bed down the hallway. George starts walking off)\nSophie (calls out): Oh, nice meeting you, Irish!\n(She waves and George waves back. He walks off looking pretty smug with himself)\n(Naomi's room, where Meredith is talking to Mrs. Cline. She hands Mrs. Cline a chart)\nMeredith: So if you'll just sign here, we can go ahead and schedule you for surgery.\nNaomi: Oh, ok. ... You know you are a gorgeous young woman. Look at you. (She signs the chart) You should smile more.\n(Meredith fakes a smile and leaves the room. Meredith is outside the room, where she notices Mr. Cline, sitting on a chair out in the hall looking downcast. She walks up to him)\nMeredith: Mr. Cline.\nTom (stands up): Oh, ah ... do me a favor.\nMeredith: Sure.\nRom: Don't tell her you saw me. I'm, I'm not sure that I'm going to go in. She's ... she can be exhausting.\nMeredith (nods): Yeah, she's...really happy.\nTom: You know I thought it was just ... falling in love, the wedding, but I was kinda hoping the honeymoon would be over by now, you know? (Meredith nods) I mean it's not normal, right? (He whispers) Nobody's that happy.\n(Meredith is walking up to the lab tech guy Jeffery at the lab desk)\nMeredith: Run another tox screen on Naomi Cline.\nJeffery: On whose orders?\nMeredith: Dr. Burke's, of course.\n(She ticks the form for the test and pushes it forward to Jeffery)\n(Izzie is walking up to the on call room. She knocks on the door lightly and enters. Dr. Bailey is lying down on one of the bottom bunks)\nIzzie: I'm sorry to bother you. The paramedics are on their way in with Yumi Miyazaki. She collapsed at the 'Taste of Seattle' and is vomiting blood.\n(Bailey looks frustrated and sits up)\nBailey: Damn fool, probably tore her esophagus in two by now.\n(She gets up and murmurs a bit, looking like she's in pain)\nIzzie: Are you ok?\n(Bailey takes a moment and then grabs her coat and starts making her way out of the room)\nBailey: Complications of Boerhaave's syndrome. Go.\nIzzie: Pleural effusion, sepsis, shock.\n(Pre-op ward where Yumi is lying, breathing difficultly on a bed and Alex is checking her vitals. Bailey and Izzie are there as well. Including a few nurses. Mr. Kamaji is watching from outside looking anxious)\nAlex: Cyanotic with shallow breast sounds. BP is 76 over 42. Tachycardic in the one thirty's. Start her on high flow O2 and give her a second dose of saline.\nBailey: Alright, let's get her to the O.R.\nIzzie: They're ready and waiting.\n(They're about to start moving Yumi's bed when she grabs Alex's hand pleadingly looking upset as if to say why is this happening? Alex looks down and the looks through the glass wall, shooting daggers at the coach)\nAlex: The freaking coach should be the one this gurney.\nBailey: Let's keep our eyes on the prize Karev. Saving this woman's life.\n(They start wheeling her out)\nAlex: I'll meet you guys up there.\n(Alex starts walking over to the coach. Izzie notices this)\nIzzie: Me too.\n(Izzie walks up quickly to Alex)\nIzzie: Hey, hey. What are you going to do? Punch him out?\nAlex: Yeah.\nIzzie: So you're going to kick his ass, get yourself kicked out of the program, before you have to open your board scores which is incase you failed. (Her beeper goes off) God, you're such an idiot.\n(She walks away)\n(O.R where Bailey is operating on Yumi. Alex and Izzie are helping and watching)\nBailey: Dr. Karev, how do I begin the esophagomyotomy?\nAlex: Cut proximal and distal to the tear to expose the mucosal defect.\nBailey: Correct. Then we'll move to debridement of the defect-\n(She gasps suddenly)\nBailey: Oh!\n(She backs away quickly from the operating table, dropping the surgical tools and starts breathing in and out quickly)\nIzzie: Dr. Bailey, those aren't Braxton Hicks contractions. I believe you're in pre-term labor.\n(Bailey gives her an annoyed look)\n(Richard is entering the OR all scrubbed up)\nRichard: Why didn't you call me sooner? (Bailey just shakes her head) Alright, just get out of here.\nBailey: I was gonna fashion a gastric patch.\nRichard: I taught you the procedure. Now leave.\n(Bailey sighs and leaves)\n(Meredith is walking up to the blood lab for the results but finds Dr. Burke already there. She walks up slowly to him)\nBurke: I got paged, Dr. Grey. Jeffery wanted to give me the results to the extensive blood work that I ordered. (He gestures to the forms Meredith filled in) You forged me signature?\nMeredith: That's really bad, right?\nBurke: Yeah that's really bad. Naomi is not on drugs. The tests came back negative.\nMeredith (amazed): They did?\nBurke: They did. Again. (Meredith shakes her head in disbelief) Next time you forge me signature, let me know. Save me a trip.\nMeredith: That's it? You're not going to yell and say 'Damn it Grey' and storm out?\nBurke (smiles): I will if you want me too.\nMeredith: No.\nJeffery (walks up to them with another test): Dr. Burke, here's another one. Her serotonin level is through the roof.\nBurke: Dr. Grey, you took a detailed history?\nMeredith: Mmm Hmm.\n(They start walking down a hallway)\nBurke: When did Mrs. Cline develop asthma?\nMeredith: After the first surgery. Why?\n(Cut to Naomi's room where she is sitting happily on her bed. Tom is standing by her bedside. Burke and Meredith are in there as well)\nBurke: We found a carcinoid tumor in the lump. Very rare. Almost impossible to diagnose. It masks itself as a bunch of seemingly unrelated symptoms. Adult onset asthma, valve failure...\nMeredith: An increased level of serotonin in the blood.\nBurke: Which creates a false sense of euphoria.\n(Naomi smiles broadly)\nTom: So, Naomi is not actually this happy. She just has a tumor?\nBurke: Exactly.\n(Meredith nods)\nTom: Thank god.\nNaomi: You people with your tumors. I tell ya, I'm infected with love!\n(She laughs)\nMeredith: I'm sorry. Your body is lying to your mind.\nNaomi: Oh let the lie continue, (to Tom) right baby?\nTom (chuckles uncomfortably): How soon can you cure her?\nBurke: Tomorrow, we can take the tumor out. If all goes well, Naomi goes back to normal.\nTom: Alright, thank you both.\n(Burke and Meredith leave the room and walk into the hallway)\nMeredith: Thank you for not chewing me out for forging your signature.\nBurke: Thank you. (Meredith looks confused) I know it was probably you who convinced Cristina. She's very strong but she listens to you. If you told her to move in ... (He smiles briefly) Anyway, thank you.\n(Burke walks off and Meredith is left looking a little uncomfortable)\nMeredith: No problem.\n(OR, Derek is about to start performing surgery on Rick. Cristina is in the OR but watching right from the back)\nDerek: Now do you have any sensation in your left arm at all?\nRick: Nope. (A doctor moves to shield Rick from watching) Actually, could I watch?\n(The doctor drops the covering so Rick can see)\nRick: I wanna see every blood vessel and nerve I'm gonna screw up if I ever smoke again. Not that I'm gonna. Ever again. (He makes eye contact with Cristina) I smoked my last cigarette.\n(Derek notices this)\nDerek: Ok, let's get started.\n(Miss. Larson, Sophie's daughter is talking to Nurse Debbie at a nurse's station)\nMiss Larson: The nursing home said she never showed up. How exactly is that possible?\nDebbie: She wouldn't leave.\nMiss Larson: My mother is old and infirm. You couldn't make her leave?\nDebbie: Have you met your mother?\nMiss Larson: Fine. Where is she now?\n(George who is walking by notices Miss. Larson)\nGeorge: Oh, hi I'm Dr. O'Malley. She's in the infectious disease service.\nMiss Larson: Infectious Disease. Since when does she have an infectious disease?\nGeorge: She doesn't. She just doesn't want to leave.\nMiss Larson: Ah, she's unbelievable.\nGeorge (smiles): Yeah she is. ... So is her room ready? I could go get her right now.\nMiss Larson: They've had the room ready for weeks.\nGeorge: No, ah not at Sugar Maple. I meant at your house.\nMiss Larson: I'm sorry?\nGeorge: The, the pink room ... (realization dawns) at your house.\n(Miss Larson just gives him a look)\n(George is entering Sophie's infectious disease room where she's watching television)\nGeorge: Hi Sophie.\n(Sophie switches off the TV)\nSophie: Irish, what a wonderful surprise! You won't catch my disease will you?\nGeorge: No, I think I'll be ok... Sophie, your daughter was just here.\n(Sophie stops smiling instantly and gets teary eyed)\nSophie: Nursing homes are for old people. I know I'm elderly. I do know that. ... But if I have to go that place, I'm afraid I'll become old.\nGeorge (takes her hand and smiles): I don't think that's possible.\nSophie (smiles): Oh.\nGeorge: You know that I, I would keep you here if I could.\nSophie: Oh, no darling you can't waste any more time with me. You have to go balls out with the dog.\nGeorge: Excuse me?\nSophie: So she chose an animal over you! So what? Women are fools. That's old news. But life's too short for you to give in, Irish. ... So fight, you fight for what's yours.\n(George leans down and kisses Sophie's hand and walks to the door)\nSophie: Now that my friend is a swagger.\n(George closes the door and places his hand against the clear glass door. Sophie lifts her hand to return the gesture. George heads off)\n(Richard is in the O.R operating on Yumi with Izzie and Alex helping)\nRichard: I'll be closing the peritoneal cavity with zero chromic sutures.\n(Nurse Debbie knocks on the glass window of the scrubs room holding up a piece of paper)\nAlex: Chief.\n(Richard turns around and sees Debbie and then turns back to the operating table)\nRichard: Let's get back to it. Pull back on that retractor. Give me more suction. I'll need a sponge on a stick.\n(Debbie enters the O.R)\nRichard: What's going on?\nDebbie: I tried but you wouldn't listen. It is now 6.07. The second shift of nurses started at 6. They're not coming in.\nRichard: Do you have any idea what a sick out would do to this hospital?\nDebbie: I've already put in the call for temps.\n(She puts down the paper she was holding on a table nearby)\nRichard: What's this?\nDebbie: Official notification. We go on strike in 10 days.\n(Yumi's post-op room where she is lying on a hospital bed. Alex is writing in her chart and Izzie is checking on her)\nAlex: You're doing good Yumi. You're doing just fine.\n(Yumi speaks Japanese)\nIzzie: We should get the translator back up here. She doesn't understand what's going on. (To Yumi) We'll be back.\n(They head out of the room where they run to Mr. Kamaji in the hallway)\nAlex: What the hell are you doing here?\nMr. Kamaji: I never would've ... I thought she would be fine. I'm sorry.\nAlex: Don't tell me. Tell her. Tell her how her career is over because of you.\n(Alex steps aside so Mr. Kamaji can walk in. Mr. Kamaji walks in slowly and bows deeply in apology and shame. Alex looks back at Izzie who nods. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the envelope Richard gave him. They move away from the door)\nIzzie (pats Alex on the back): Way better than punching him out.\nAlex: Hey uh ... can you (he holds out the envelope to Izzie)\nIzzie (takes the envelope): You want me to open it?\nAlex: Yeah, yeah you know it's just, I can't. Izzie (she tries to hand it back): I shouldn't, I mean I...\nAlex (interrupts): Look you already think I'm an idiot. It won't be any great shock.\n(Izzie sighs and opens the envelope. She pulls out the letter and reads it. She puts the letter in front of Alex)\nIzzie: Congratulations. (Alex grins at her and looks down at the letter) You are not an idiot. Except when you're being an idiot.\n(Izzie walks off)\n(Cristina is checking on Rick's fingers in his patient room. She walks out the room where she runs into Derek)\nDerek: How's he doing?\nCristina: Ah jonesing for a cigarette but I'll think he'll make it to the end of the day.\nDerek: Good. ... I was being nice to her.\nCristina: Ok.\nDerek: I can be nice without being ... (he gestures)\nCristina (disbelieving): McDreamy, I know.\nDerek: I really can.\nCristina (still disbelieving): Ok.\nDerek: Ok then.\n(He walks into the room)\n(A nurse is pushing Dr. Bailey dressed to go home in a wheelchair down a hallway. Addison is walking beside her and they are being followed the 'gang' Cristina, Izzie, Meredith, Alex and George)\nAddison: Bed rest at home until the baby comes. You do know what bed rest is don't you Miranda?\nBailey: Yeah hell.\n(She's being wheeled backwards into an elevator)\nIzzie: Hell with TV and books. (She hands Bailey a present) Here it's from all of us.\n(Bailey takes it grudgingly. They all smile at her from outside the elevator. They elevator doors begin to close, but Bailey stops it with her foot)\nBailey: I may be 47 months pregnant (The group looks apprehensive as they were about to walk off. Addison has already walked off) I may be on bed rest. I may not be able to see my own feet but I am Dr. Bailey. I hear everything. I know everything. I'm watching each and every one of you. And I will return.\n(The doors close)\n(Richard is wiping the OR board clean himself. Burke is standing near the stairs watching him. Derek walks up to Burke)\nDerek: Strike?\nBurke: Strike.\nRichard (turns around): You are all a bunch of arrogant surgeons.\n(He walks off. Burke and Derek exchange looks)\n(Cristina walks into an empty gallery except for Meredith who is on her mobile)\nCristina: Hey.\nMeredith: Hey. (She hangs up) That was Izzie. She refuses to take the dog home.\nCristina: Mmm Hmm. (She sighs and sits down in front of Meredith) Fine, if you want me to tell Burke I didn't move in I'll tell him.\nMeredith: No don't.\nCristina: What?\nMeredith: Don't tell him. At least not right now or tonight. (Cristina sighs in relief) I just mean wait. It can wait. (Cristina nods) I lied about Derek. We're not just friends. I mean, I'm not. He's still McDreamy.\n(Cristina stands up and rubs Meredith's arm comfortingly)\nCristina: I know.\n(She walks out of the gallery)\n(Intern locker room, there is a notice board showing a flyer for Doc. George walks in and sees Doc lying down on the floor. In fact there are a lot of fliers advertising Doc. Meredith is sitting dressed to go home in front of her locker. George sits down next to her)\nGeorge: You don't get to choose.\nMeredith: Huh?\nGeorge: I know you've been going through a bad time. I know you miss Shepherd. And I know that your life has admittedly been pretty unpleasant these days. You get points for breathing in and out. You get to be a little selfish. But you don't get to choose a dog over me. ... I'm George. I sleep down the hall from you. I buy your tampons. I have ... held your hand every time you've asked. I've earned the right to be seen. To be respected. To not have you think of me as less than a dog that you got at the pound. ...So, I'm not moving out. Whether you like it or not, I'm staying.\n(Meredith just looks at him)\nMVO: No matter how hard we try to ignore it or deny it. Eventually the lies fall away.\n(Cristina is sitting up-right looking hesitant on Burke's bed. She sighs and lies down next to Burke who wraps his arms around her)\nBurke: I'm glad you moved in.\nCristina: So am I.\nMVO: Whether we like it or not.\n(Izzie, Meredith and George are exiting out of Meredith's Jeep. Izzie hands George some Doc's toys while Meredith gets Doc out from the back)\nMeredith: Ok, Doc. Let's go.\n(They're in front of Derek's trailer. Derek and Addison out and meet them. Meredith looks upset)\nDerek: Hey Doc. Hey buddy. Welcome home.\nAddison: Hey. He's beautiful.\n(They start patting Doc)\nIzzie: I brought his toys.\nGeorge: And his food and water.\nMeredith: Here.\n(Meredith hands the leash over to Addison)\nMeredith: Thanks for doing this. I know it's a lot to ask.\nAddison: It's all right. It's just a dog, right? Come on Doc.\n(She walks away and takes Doc into the trailer)\nIzzie (to Meredith): Ah, we'll just wait by the car.\nMeredith: Ok. (George and Izzie walk back to the car) So he ah chews everything. So don't leave anything out. (Derek nods) He hates cats and small little yappy dogs. Oh (she shakes her head) not house broken.\nDerek: Oh!\nMeredith: Probably should've told you that.\nDerek: Yeah.\n(They stare at each other for a bit)\nMeredith: You don't have to do this you know?\nDerek (nods): What I got, I got all this land. It's just going to waste.\n(Meredith nods)\nMeredith: Derek.\nDerek: It's just a dog. It doesn't mean anything. He'll be a fine.\n(Meredith forces a smile)\nMeredith: Yeah. Ok. Goodnight.\nDerek: Goodnight.\n(Meredith turns back towards her car)\nMVO: But here's the truth about the truth. It hurts.\n(Derek looks on after her for a bit and then heads back into the trailer)\nMVO: So we lie.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Oh, god, very exciting! Vacation!\nRoz takes one of the brochures from Frasier.\nRoz: Wow! The Golden Door Spa!\nFrasier: Ooh, yes!\nRoz: Look at those accommodations! That is nice!\nShe gives the leaflet to Frasier.\nFrasier: I plan to leave Dad and Eddie to fend for themselves while I go off and spend an obscene amount of money being pampered like a spoiled child. I know it's self-indulgent, but what else are vacations for? By the way, what are you doing for your week off?\nRoz: Oh, I'm taking my mom to Ireland to stay in the sod house where her mother was born.\nFrasier: Why don't you just write the words \"bad son\" on my forehead!\nRoz: Listen, there is nothing wrong with pampering yourself on your vacation. After all, you do work three hours a day.\nFrasier stands up, annoyed, turns his back on her, and begins to sort through his brochures on the side bench of the studio.\nRoz: I'm sorry. That one even surprised me!\nShe walks into the adjoining producer's suite. Frasier follows her through.\nFrasier: You know, it's just that when I think of the relationship I have with my dad I can't help but envy the relationship you have with your mother.\nRoz: Well, it didn't just happen. We work at it, spend time together...\nFrasier: Roz, are you forgetting that my father lives with me? How much more time together could we spend!\nRoz: Day to day living is different. You know, there is nothing better than taking a trip together. You get to have a little fun, you get to relax... you get to see a whole different side to the other person.\nFrasier: You know, in his entire life, my dad has never been to Europe. It would be a way of connecting with him if I were the one to give him that. [looks questioningly at Roz] So, what would you charge me to take him to Ireland with you?\nRoz looks at him with a wry smile on her face and shakes her head.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene Two - Frasier's Apartment Fade back in. Niles is sitting with his face down on the table as Daphne massages his back. Martin is sitting in his chair with the paper in one hand, and is stroking Eddie with the other.\nNiles: [moaning with pleasure:] Ahh... I should have known this would happen. I always throw out my back when I try to lift Maris's luggage.\nDaphne: Why didn't you hire a skycap?\nNiles: Oh, we did for most of it, but Maris won't trust strangers with her makeup case, ever since a ham-handed porter dropped it and broke three vials of rare Swiss lamb placenta. On the upside, the calfskin lining of her case was never more soft and supple.\nDaphne lifts him to sit up straight, puts her arm around his neck and proceeds to massage his back with the fist of her right hand.\nDaphne: Where did Mrs. Crane go, anyway?\nNiles gives more moans of pleasure, and Martin looks round at him in amusement.\nNiles: She's making her annual pilgrimage to the holy land.\nMartin: I thought she was going to Dallas to visit her sister.\nNiles: That is her holy land. It's the site of the first Nieman- Marcus.\nMartin turns back to his paper, shaking his head. Niles produces more moans of ecstasy. Frasier enters the apartment, carrying his briefcase.\nDaphne: Oh, Dr. Crane...\nNiles: [still moaning] Oh, call me Niles!\nFrasier casts his usual look of disapproval and disappointment in Niles's direction, and Niles, noticing him, stands up.\nNiles: Thank you, Daphne.\nFrasier: Dad, I've had an idea and I hope you're as excited about it as I am. [opens his briefcase and takes out the holiday brochures] I want to take you on vacation!\nMartin: [suspicious] Why?\nFrasier: Well, I thought an adventure might do us good, give us a chance to have some fun, maybe get reacquainted, even do a little bonding.\nMartin: What'd you have in mind?\nFrasier: Well, this isn't about where I want to go, this is about where you want to go.\nFrasier fans out the leaflets and lays them on the table by his father in an extravagant gesture.\nFrasier: Dad, I give you the world!\nMartin: [reading one] The Galy-pay-gos islands, huh? \"Where iguanas, sea-lions and giant tortoises live in eternal harmony.\" [to Frasier] Is it important they get along?\nFrasier: No, I suppose not.\nNiles has also been looking through the leaflets.\nNiles: Oh, how about this! India and Nepal! Trek the foothills of the Himalayas!\nMartin: [tapping his cane] I think you're forgetting about my old pal here.\nNiles: No problem. Frasier can just hire a really tough little Sherpa to carry you on his back.\nMartin looks at him stupidly.\nNiles: They don't mind.\nFrasier: Well, we obviously haven't struck the right chord yet, but we will, we will. Dad, why don't you just suggest something?\nMartin: You really want to go on a trip with me?\nFrasier: Yes I do! I'll go anywhere you want to! Anywhere!\nMartin: Okay. Well, maybe I'm not as sophisticated as you, but I think I should see America first!\nFrasier: Great! We're Americans, we should see America!\nMartin: And I want to see it in a Winnebago!\nFrasier stands up in horror, but with feigned enthusiasm.\nFrasier: A Winnebago! Hot damn, that has a real ring to it! He crosses to pour a drink.\nMartin: Yeah! It's something your mother and I always dreamed about doing when I retired.\nFrasier: Then that is exactly the trip we are going to take!\nMartin: You really mean it?\nFrasier: Absolutely!\nDaphne: This calls for a celebration!\nDaphne exits to kitchen, Frasier crosses to fire place and Martin also exits towards the kitchen.\nMartin: Yeah, let's pop open a couple of beers! I think I've got a bag of pork rinds in here too!\nFrasier: Oh, the final touch! I almost feel like I'm in a trailer park already!\nHe hangs his head in horror, leaning on the mantelpiece in despair. Niles crosses the room towards him.\nNiles: [mockingly] Oh, Winnebago Boy? Make sure to hang a lot of beach chairs on the back and give it a really cute name like... \"The Whoopin' Cranes!\"\nHe dissolves into laughter.\nFrasier: Oh, Niles. When I agreed to see America with Dad I thought we'd be staying in five-star resorts! When I said together I meant adjoining suites!\nNiles: Just tell him you think it's a bad idea.\nFrasier: I can't do that, he's counting on this trip too much. It was his dream, he was going to go on this trip with Mom.\nNiles: Yeah, but she lucked out and died! [laughs]\nFrasier pulls Niles to the corner of the apartment to be sure they can't be heard from the kitchen.\nFrasier: [in desperation] Niles listen, listen. If Dad and I get into a Winnebago together only one of us will come out alive. You've got to come with us!\nNiles: Frasier, you're my brother. That entitles you to my bone marrow and one of my kidneys, but THIS is an imposition!\nCut to Martin and Daphne in the kitchen. Daphne is chopping cheese, and Martin sits opposite her.\nMartin: You've got to come with us!\nDaphne: Why?\nMartin: Well, Frasier and I don't have anything to talk about! I always feel more comfortable when there's someone else around, or the TV's blaring.\nDaphne: Then why did you suggest it?\nMartin: Well, it sounded like a good idea when it came out of my mouth, but the more I think about it... I mean, can you really see me and Frasier together all day and then crawling into our bunks at Night, lying head to head... bonding? [shivers] Eew! I'll pay you! I've got pension money!\nCut back to Niles and Frasier.\nFrasier: I remember a car trip we took when I was nine? We drove from Seattle to Spokane. The only thing he said to me was, \"I think we've got a problem with your brother Frasier.\"\nNiles: Those were awful, those family driving vacations. Dad insisting on covering as many miles as possible in a day. The two of us tiny hostages in the back seat, clutching our car sickness bags... straining to see something out of the window as the landscape whizzed by... I was thirteen before I realized cows aren't blurry!\nCut to Martin and Daphne.\nDaphne: Why don't you just tell him you don't want to go?\nMartin: Oh, you heard how he wants to go. I don't want to disappoint him!\nCut to Niles and Frasier.\nFrasier: I don't want to disappoint him!!\nNiles: I'm sorry Frasier, I am not a Winnebago person.\nHe begins to cross to refill his drink.\nNiles: Whenever I see one on the highway I look into the driver's eyes, hoping to see something that would explain why in God's name he would ever want to do something like this! All I see is a death stare under the brim of a hat made out of Miller Lite cans. This is my final word: I'm-not-going.\nMartin and Daphne re-enter. Daphne is carrying some cheese chunks on a plate.\nMartin: Hey, great news, Daphne's coming too!\nNiles: And so am I!\nHe eats a cheese chunk.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTHE WHOOPIN' CRANES\nScene Three - A Winnebago. The Crane clan, plus Daphne, are traveling along in their rented Winnebago. The north-western American countryside is visible out of the rear window. Frasier is driving, and Martin is in the passenger seat videotaping the view. Daphne is sitting behind them. Niles appears to be absent from the scene.\nMartin: It's everything I'd hoped it'd be, only better! It's like sitting in your own living room watching TV! Only it isn't TV, it's America!\nFrasier: Yes Dad, it's the ultimate in virtual reality programming - actual reality.\nMartin: [Looking at map] Okay, we've got a turn-off coming up in about five miles, so start slowing down.\nFrasier: Righto, Dad.\nDaphne: How does it feel behind that wheel, Dr. Crane?\nFrasier: Manly! This is mine, and it's big!\nThere is a flushing sound, and Niles appears from the back of the vehicle.\nNiles: Oh my God! It's like being sealed upright in a Formica coffin!\nMartin: Remember the old days, Niles? [to Daphne] When they were kids, all they had in the back seat was a mayonnaise jar.\nFrasier: Yes, it took quite a bit of skill to use it successfully at seventy miles per hour! Never really been fond of mayonnaise since...\nNiles: Or speed bumps.\nMartin: Okay, turnoff's coming up now, we're about four miles away, get ready, it's coming up! Alright, you're okay on the right! It's never to early to move over!\nFrasier: You know, Dad, I was wondering. What inspired you to choose that uniquely American man-made wonder, Mount Rushmore?\nMartin: Well, we've got a week off, right? That's as far as we can go in three and a half days and still make it back. We get there, get out, walk around the Valley of the Presidents, drive back, boom! Another fine landmark under our belts!\nDaphne: Well, you've certainly got this trip well-planned, Mr. Crane! Whenever I take a holiday I just grab a fresh pair of knickers and see where the wind takes me!\nAt this comment Niles proceeds to look back at Daphne's backside.\nFrasier: [noticing] Niles... Niles!\nFrasier then pulls hard right on the steering wheel making the vehicle swerve sharply left. Everyone else remains in the same place but Niles, caught off balance, crashes left into some overhead cupboards, right into a chair behind Daphne and then falls spectacularly onto the floor whilst clutching at the kitchen sideboard. He quickly attempts to retake his place behind Frasier, before Daphne and Martin notice.\nUnsuccessfully. Martin looks strangely at Niles, not realising why Frasier swerved, then looks curiously at Frasier as if to say, \"What the hell was that!\" Frasier, however, drives on happily with a large smile on his face.\nFrasier: You know, what Daphne is saying is what we should really be doing!\nMartin: What are you talking about?\nFrasier: Well, you know, why should we be so beholden to maps and schedules? We should roam! America has always been enchanted with the romance of the open highway. Jack Kerouac went \"on the road,\" Buzz and Todd got their \"kicks on Route 66!\" The adventure is in the journey! We should just ramble!\nNiles: Good golly, I'm inspired. I'm going to put on a baseball cap.\nHe proceeds to put on a cap, backwards.\nMartin: Frasier watch it, you're going to miss the turn off!!\nFrasier: So?\nMartin: We'll get lost!\nFrasier: Lost from where? We're in a house on wheels! Wherever we go, we're home!\nMartin: No! It's coming up! [tugging at Frasier's arm] It's coming up! Alright, turn here! [frantically] This is it! Turn! Turn here...! We missed it!!\nDaphne and Niles look on in amusement.\nFrasier: Dad, we didn't miss anything!\nMartin: [horrified] Oh my God!\nFrasier: We are now on the road less traveled. From now on there is a new order! We dance to the rhythm of the road.\nMartin: [panicking] Alright, now don't panic! There's got to be an access road leading back onto that turn off...\nHe proceeds to hunt around the map, frantically.]\nMartin: Where is it? Where is it! [finds it] Oh, it's always in the crack!\nFrasier: So is life, Dad.\nEnd Of Act One (Time: 10:23) Act Two.\nScene One - Winnebago Fade in. Several hours have elapsed, and Martin is now driving. Niles and Frasier stand behind the two front seats, for Eddie is sitting in the front passenger chair.\nMartin: I've got to say, I was pretty anxious, but I'm starting to like this free spirit stuff!\nFrasier: [pointing out of window] Oh Dad, Dad look! There's a historical marker up ahead! Let's stop! Let's go see it, huh?\nMartin: Yes, just driving wherever you feel like it...\nNiles: It's educational Dad, there! There! There! There! There! Dad!\nThe Crane boys are pointing excitedly, but Martin drives right past. Niles and Frasier follow it as it whizzes by, and then turn back to the front disappointedly.\nNiles: What did it say?\nFrasier: I don't know. The only word I saw was \"Legendary.\"\nNiles: [spotting another attraction on the other side of the road] Oh, oh look, a roadside stand! Fresh fruit, homemade apple cider! Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad...\nBoth: Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, DAD!\nMartin once again drives right by and the boys turn to look at the stand as it whizzes by. Once again they turn back disappointedly, and Niles punches the back of Martins chair lightly.\nFrasier: Look Dad, you seem to be missing the freewheeling concept.\nHe tries to sit down but Eddie is in the chair. He sits down anyway and Eddie is squashed to the side of the chair, then sits on Frasier's knee.\nNiles picks up the camcorder and begins to film the view out of the front of the van.\nFrasier: We're supposed to go where the wind blows us, for god's sakes!\nMartin: It's blowing, we're going, why are you moaning?\nFrasier: [angrily] What is this obsession you have with covering a certain distance?\nMartin: It's just the way I relax!\nA car drives past, horn blaring. Martin leans out of the window to shout at it.\nMartin: Hey, watch it! I've got my kids in the car!\nAs he has been shouting he has veered to the left. He straightens out quickly by swerving to the right, sending Niles once again crashing into the overhead lockers. Niles reels back, stunned.\nFrasier: What you call relaxing seems like a man with an obsession to me! Don't you think so, Niles?\nHe turns to Niles, who has started to videotape Daphne, who is sleeping.\nFrasier: Niles! What are you doing?!\nNiles: I'm making a vacation video, something that we can look at years from now, over and over and over and over again...\nFrasier stands up and takes the camera from him.\nFrasier: Just give me that!\nMartin: Okay, you guys want to stop so bad, we'll stop. See that sign over there?\nNiles: \"Have your photo taken with a live grizzly bear - Marvella's souvenirs and gifts - one mile.\"\nMartin: Yeah! I always wanted to have my picture taken with a bear!\nFrasier: Well, some dreams cannot be denied! [looking into the passenger side view mirror] Okay dad, alright, you're good here, you're good on my side, dad. Alright, just go ahead, ease it right over, it's never to early to change lanes... [realising what he is saying] Oh my God, it must be genetic.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene Two - inside Marvella's souvenirs and gifts. The Frasier gang enter, and Eddie starts to bark at a full-size, stuffed grizzly bear propped up in front of a painted view of a mountain surrounded by trees. The rest of the store is full of various souvenirs and junk items. There is a woman standing behind a counter.\nMarvella: Get your dog away from my bear! I just had him cleaned!\nDaphne: He's stuffed!\nFrasier: You know, your sign said \"a live bear.\"\nMarvella: It's an old sign.\nMartin: [looking at picture behind bear] Would you look at that view! It's like we're really there!\nFrasier: Yes, but if we were actually there dad, we'd be whizzing past at fifty miles per hour!\nNiles: Oh Frasier, look! It's the gourmet food department!\nFrasier: Oh! Homemade deer jerky!\nNiles: [reading notice with a sarcastic laugh] No sampling...\nFrasier: No problem!\nMartin and Daphne are standing in front of the bear.\nMartin: Okay! [to lady] Excuse me! Would you take our picture, please? Niles, Frasier, come on up here! Okay, everybody, alright, here we go! Everybody ready? Now, what should we do?\nFrasier: Well, how about this? [he puts his hands up and opens his mouth wide as if he's scared of the bear]\nMartin: Yeah! That's great, I like that! Okay, everybody! Eddie?\nMarvella: Now, before I take it, you know it's ten dollars Canadian.\nFrasier: Oh, for a treasured memory like this, what's money?\nEveryone puts on their \"scared\" faces.\nMarvella: Okay, one...\nDaphne: Why would she want Canadian dollars?\nMarvella: Two...\nMartin: Because we're in Canada.\nMarvella: Three!\nOn \"three,\" Daphne screams loudly as Marvella takes the picture. Everybody looks at her as she steps forward off the photo platform.\nDaphne: We're in Canada?!\nMartin: Yeah, we crossed the border a while ago, when you were taking a nap.\nDaphne: But we can't be in Canada! I'm not allowed to leave the United States!\nFrasier: Why?\nDaphne: Because I don't have my green card yet! Oh, this is just perfect! Three months until my final interview, the one thing they told me not to do was to leave the country! And what do you do? Wait until the first time I fall asleep and drag me across the bleeding border! They're never going to let me back in!\nNiles: They have to take you back, it's not your fault. [He crosses to comfort her]\nFrasier: [to Martin] This wouldn't have happened if you weren't so hell-bent on getting so many miles under your belt today!\nMartin: Well, you're the one who had to go where the wind blows!\nMartin and Frasier proceed to yell at each other loudly and angrily. Niles attempts to butt in to calm them down but can't find an appropriate break in the argument to make himself heard. Daphne grabs a duck call and blows it loudly to grab their attention, near-deafening Niles in the process.\nDaphne: Never mind whose fault it is, I'm stuck here! What am I going to do?\nNiles: We'll just go to the authorities and explain. I'm sure mishaps like this happen all the time.\nMartin: Oh, get real Niles, they've got the rules!\nFrasier: Oh, then what's your solution dad?\nMartin: Just sneak her back across the border.\nNiles: That's called smuggling!\nMartin: [very sarcastically] Oh, thanks Niles. I knew it was something bad guys did, I just didn't know the technical term!\nFrasier: Dad, I can't believe that you of all people, a former policeman, are actually suggesting that we commit a felony!\nMartin: Oh, I cross this border plenty! Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the guards just peek in the door and wave you through. It's no big deal. Now let's get out of here!\nNiles: Well, what if they pull us over?\nMartin: Then Daphne's just got to convince them that she's an American.\nDaphne: Bloody right! It beats having me bum bounced back across the pond! Let's give it a bash.\nThe others exit and Frasier is left holding the door.\nFrasier: Oh, yes. This is foolproof... Frasier exits.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTHE HOLE IN THE HEAD GANG\nScene Three - The Winnebago Back in the motor home, heading for the border. Frasier is driving, Niles and Daphne are sitting at the table. Martin is pacing up and down the van.\nNiles: I'm about to defraud the United States Immigration Department. Not just me, my father and my older brother. People who should be role models for me. It's not my fault; I'm the product of a bad environment.\nMartin: [to Daphne] Now listen, on the off chance that the guard asks you a question, can you say anything in an American accent?\nDaphne: [in a poor imitation of a U.S. accent] Sure.\nMartin: Okay, what?\nDaphne: You just heard it!\nMartin: What?\nDaphne: [repeating the accent] \"Sure.\" That's it, that's all I can say! [Martin looks horrified] Oh, I need a cup of tea!\nFrasier: TEA! Why don't you just wave a crumpet in the air and start singing, \"God save the Queen\"!!\nNiles: Don't you snap at her, Frasier, you're a psychiatrist. You should be in better control of your emotions. [panicking] Oh my God, there's the border! I can see the line of cars!\nMartin: Alright, now everybody calm down, we're going to be fine. Just remember that they'll be looking for suspicious behavior. [Niles is rocking back and forth with his head resting on his arm.] Niles, that qualifies! Alright, now if the guard pokes his head in here, what did we say he's going to see?\nAll: Four carefree Americans.\nDaphne: I've never been so nervous.\nFrasier: I don't think there's any need to be. They're waving everyone through... they're not even asking any questions!\nNiles: Oh, please, please, please!\nFrasier: They're waving us through... they're waving us through... they're pulling us over... they're pulling us over!\nThe gang look mortified. Niles resumes rocking back and forwards.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCHECKPOINT CHARLIE\nScene Four - Winnebago. The van has stopped, and the guard is approaching.\nMartin: Here comes the guard.\nDaphne: I can't do this.\nMartin: Now everything's going to be fine, don't worry. Just remember to keep your answers short. People who have something to hide always talk too much.\nGuard enters.\nGuard: Hi, folks.\nMartin: Hi, there!\nGuard: Have a good time in Canada?\nMartin: Oh, great!\nFrasier: Canada, wow!\nGuard: [to Niles] What was the purpose of your trip to Canada, sir?\nAfter a long pause and a look at Martin, he answers deadpan:\nNiles: Fun.\nGuard: [after an equally long pause] I see. [to Frasier] And where were you born, Sir?\nFrasier: Seattle, Washington. Oh, you want to know what country? Oh, well, America! Of course! I'm quite an American really, I vote all the time, and always for the law and order guy!\nI...\nGuard: That's fine, sir, I don't need any more details. [To Daphne] And you, Miss? Did you enjoy Canada?\nDaphne: [In her ever-so-convincing accent] Sure!\nGuard: And the weather?\nDaphne: Sure, sure!\nGuard: [To Frasier] Is this your vehicle Sir?\nFrasier: Oh, no. Yes, yes! Well, I rented it! It's American-made, you see, I always look for that union label...\nGuard: I just need your license and registration.\nFrasier: Oh, right, uh, it's right here in this little side pocket. There's the registration. Let me get my license out for you... oh, yes, here we are!\nGuard: Stay right here.\nThe Guard exits to check the documents.\nMartin: [sarcastically] Well, I can certainly depend on my gang, can't\nI?\nNiles: [standing] That's it. I'm going to be arrested!\nHe sits in the passenger seat.\nDaphne: We're all getting arrested! She crosses to sit where Niles was, by the door.\nNiles: Yes, but I have delicate features. Prison will be hell for me!\nMartin: Cool it, Niles.\nDaphne: It's too late to turn back! I say we make a run for it.\nFrasier: Oh yes, great idea! A high-speed chase in an eight-ton motor home! It'll make an amusing anecdote for the border guard newsletter!\nMartin: Now will everybody just shut up? You keep babbling like this they're going to catch us for sure! [looks out of window] He's coming back!\nThe guard enters.\nGuard: Well, these check out.\nAll: Well, glad to hear that...\nFrasier: All strictly on the up and up...\nDaphne has her head turned from the guard. He looks at her suspiciously.\nGuard: Miss, you've been very quiet. Is there something I should know here?\nDaphne says nothing but smiles and shakes her head.\nGuard: You seem awfully nervous. May I have your name, please? Daphne looks mortified. She looks at Martin for help.\nMartin: Oh, alright. I guess I should have known better than to try something like this\nNiles: [standing] Dad, don't!\nFrasier: It was just a mistake!\nGuard: [to Niles and Frasier] You men just want to back off? [to Martin] What is it you want to say, sir?\nMartin: We were trying to pull one over on you. Eddie?\nEddie jumps into his lap.\nMartin: We don't have a rabies certificate for the dog.\nGuard: I knew something was going on here.\nThe Guard crosses to check the rest of the van, then stands by Martin.\nMartin: Yeah, well you see, we weren't planning on coming here, and when we got to the border we just forgot all about it.\nNiles: I for one, didn't even know that you needed one.\nFrasier: Yes, but ignorance of the law is no defense so take the little dog away and we'll be off!\nMartin: [casting Frasier a very evil look] Look, this is my fault. If you're worried that we picked the dog up here in Canada, well we didn't. I mean I've got a picture I can show you. Here's a picture of him taken at the Seattle Space Needle.\nHe shows the guard a wallet photo of Eddie. Martin's old police badge is still in the wallet, and he makes it quite obvious to the guard.\nGuard: I see you've got a badge there.\nMartin: [with mock surprise] Oh, yeah!\nGuard: Are you a policeman?\nMartin: Retired. Thirty years on the Seattle police force. Me of all people should know better, huh?\nFrasier: Absolutely.\nNiles: Definitely.\nDaphne: [still with accent] Sure.\nGuard: Next time remember the rabies certificate. Have a safe trip home.\nMartin: Thanks, officer.\nFrasier: Thank you.\nThe Guard exits. They all break into individual victory dances.\nMartin: Drive! They all remember themselves and turn to carry on their journey.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene Five - Winnebago Fade in. Night has fallen, and Niles and Daphne are asleep. Martin is driving, and Frasier comes to sit next to him in the passenger seat. Eddie barks at him as he walks by.\nFrasier: [to Eddie] They would have returned you eventually! So dad, how long 'til we get home?\nMartin: About two hours. This highway goes right into Seattle. Why don't you lean back, take a little nap?\nFrasier: Oh no, I'm okay. I though maybe we'd chat a little bit.\nMartin: Oh yeah, great!\nThere is an awkward, long, silence.\nMartin: You know Frasier, I just can't help it. When we're alone together I just don't know what the hell to say. I'm sure you figured out that's why I asked Daphne to come along.\nFrasier: Well, I had my suspicions but I hoped that wasn't the case.\nMartin: Oh, knock it off. That's why you asked Niles to come along too.\nFrasier: That's why I asked him, but that's not why he came.\nThey both laugh.\nMartin: You know, the funny thing, we didn't have such a bad time, did we? [they both laugh again]\nFrasier: [imitating guard and Martin] \"I see you've got a badge there...\" \"Oh, yeah!\"\nThey laugh again. Frasier picks up the map and starts to examine it.\nFrasier: You know dad, there's no reason for us to cut our trip short. According to this map we're not that far from Yellowstone.\nMartin: Oh, I always wanted to see Old Faithful!\nFrasier: Me, too!\nMartin: If you wanted a real adventure we could drop these two sleeping beauties off at home first.\nFrasier: You mean it? Just the two of us alone?\nMartin: Yeah!\nFrasier: Just you and me, father and son!\nMartin: Yeah! You and me, camping out in Yellowstone, all alone!\nFrasier: All by ourselves!\nThe excitement goes out of their faces as the reality of this situation dawns on them. There is another awkward silence.\nMartin: Well, you know, it'd be an awful shame if Daphne didn't get to see those Indian paint pots...\nFrasier: Yes, of course.\nMartin: They are a real miracle of nature.\nFrasier: Yeah. Wouldn't be fair to leave Niles just to ramble around that old house all by himself.\nMartin: Maris out of town? That'd be cruel.\nFrasier: Yeah, absolutely. So, how long do you figure it'll take us to get to Yellowstone?\nMartin: Well, if we drive all night we'll be there tomorrow.\nFrasier: It'll be a nice surprise for the two of them when they wake up in the morning.\nMartin: I've got a better surprise than that: let's tell Daphne we're in Mexico!\nMartin and Frasier burst into devilish laughter. End Of Act Two. (Time 22:20)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe Camcorder, supposedly held by Niles, is being used to film a sleeping Daphne. However she wakes up and is shocked. The view then pans round to the left to reveal a very disapproving Frasier looking right into the camera.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The text is a dialogue between Frasier and Martin, who are father and son. They are on a road trip together, and Frasier has suggested that they should extend their trip to include a visit to Yellowstone National Park. However, Martin is reluctant to do so because he is worried about leaving his wife and Niles behind. Frasier tries to convince him that it would be a good opportunity for them to spend some quality time together, but Martin is still hesitant. Eventually, they come up with a plan to tell Daphne and Niles that they are in Mexico, and Martin suggests that they should film a video of Daphne sleeping to use as proof. However, Daphne wakes up and is shocked to see the camera pointed at her. Frasier is caught on camera looking disapprovingly at her.</s>The invention provides a method for preparing a high-purity nano-silicon powder, which comprises the following steps:"

Congratulations, man, this is a major turning point.\nDawson: And I am eternally lost as a species on this planet.\nPacey: Oh, this is going to be bad...\nDawson: I'm about to be 16 in a matter of minutes and I'm still....me. The same whiny, adolescent, big-talking, small-doing loser that I was a year ago.\nPacey: C'mon, Dawson, that's not true.\nDawson: It's completely true! I mean, think about it. Every single person that I know is growing up and moving forward in some way. I mean, Joey is busy finding herself. You've got this whole stable, do-gooder, boyfriend thing. Jen is....not necessarily moving forward but at least she's moving. Even my parents are getting new lives! But me, I'm in the exact same place I was one year ago.\nPacey: Yeah, but you're turning 16, Dawson. Rejoice. This is a good thing. You're getting older.\nDawson: But there doesn't seem to be anything ahead of me. More of the same. I'm stagnet. No wonder Joey dumped me. I mean, the only thing I accomplished last year was realizing my feelings for her and I couldn't even hold on to her. She dumped me. For a gay guy. *laughs* Can we talk about this whole gay-man-straight-woman thing? There's got to be something going on there that we're not seeing.\nPacey: You're right, Dawson. It's all part of the evil gay plan to keep the species from repopulating.\nDawson: I would keep an eye on Andie if I were you.\nPacey: C'mon, Dawson. You need to stop looking to movies for all the answers to life's questions. Okay? What you need to do is figure out what it is in life that you want and make it happen! Okay? Be definitive!\nDawson: You're right. I need--I need definitive answers. Joey's the answer. I had her, I lost her, and now I'm going to get her back. How's that for definitive? *Dawson walks out his bedroom door and shuts it leaving Pacey in the room. Pacey sighs.* *Cut to Mitch cooking pancakes in the Leery house and Gail walks into the kitchen and is surprised to see him.*\nGail: Mitch?\nMitch: Hey! You remember my tradition of cooking Dawson breakfast on his birthday, right?\nGail: Well, of course, but I just thought that-- *Dawson walks in*\nDawson: Dad?\nMitch: You didn't think that I would forget, did you? The usual for our favorite customer.\nDawson: Thank you. It's nice to have a bit of tradition this morning.\nMitch: Um, speaking of which, I have to talk to your mom in private for a second. About birthday stuff, strictly confidential. *They walk out onto the porch.*\nMitch: Look, uh, I know we haven't discussed it...in the events of the past year, but we usually give joint birthday presents and I had an idea...\nGail: You know, you're a little late for this, Mitch, I already bought Dawson a present. I'm giving Dawson his first car tonight. An Explorer.\nMitch: Well, that's a big decision, Gail. Don't you think it's one we could of made together? *Cut to Dawson eating his breakfast looking out towards the door which was left open slightly and he can see his parents arguing. Gail says something about how she's paying everything, the bills, etc. Cut back out on the porch.*\nMitch: Look, I know that I should contribute more financially, but I put the restaurant plans on the back burner and I have looked into substituting at the high school. *Cut back to Dawson listening to them arguing. Cut to the Icehouse. Joey's sitting on the counter and Pacey is sitting on a stool next to her.*\nJoey: Let's go over this one more time.\nPacey: Okay. I invite Dawson out to dinner with Andie and me tonight. I'll keep him occupied until about 9 o' clock, and which point, we'll make up some lame ass excuse about how we have to call it an early night. Then, we'll drive back to his house where...\nJoey: I'll have set up the most fabulous surprise party ever. I hope.\nPacey: I'm sure it'll be fantastic. Testimonial to true friendship. The party to end all parties. From now on, the Leery house is going to be known as the Delta house of Capeside.\nJoey: Thanks. I don't know why I'm so nervous. I've never organized a party before. *Jack walks in. Joey doesn't say anything to him. He notices and turns back around and leaves.*\nPacey: Listen, Joey, not to pry or anything, how are you doing? I mean, now that you've had time to process.\nJoey: God. Everyone keeps asking me that in these solemn tones. Like I've just come down with some terminal disease. I mean, Jack's the one who's going through something. I mean, yeah, I admit, at first it was obviously a shock but I mean, I'm fine. Really. It's just... *Joey makes facial languages that convey that it's nothing. Cut to Jack, outside of the Icehouse by all the tables. Abby and two friends walk up.*\nAbby: Jaaccckkk, are you serving lunch yet?\nJack: Um, yeah, in about 10 minutes. Hey, here's some menus you can look at in the meantime.\nAbby: Great, we're completely starving.\nKelly: Aren't you that guy?\nJack: What?\nKelly: The first guy to ever come out of Capeside? He was the one who wrote the poem.\nJaycee: Oh my God! You're the gay guy!\nAbby: In the flesh.\nJack: *uncomfortably* Yeah..\nAbby: Jaycee, Kelly, this is Jack McPhee. Capeside's no longer ambiguous resident.\nKelly: You know, I think it's so great that you came out and you're only 16. You know, I totally watched Ellen through that whole tulmultuous year and, well, she didn't come out until she was, like, 40.\nJack: Um, can I get you guys something to drink while you're looking over those menus?\nJaycee: You know what I just realized? You're the first actual gay person that I've ever met.\nAbby: It is such a total waste because I mean, you're a total babe.\nJack: You know, I'd take that as a compliment if it wasn't coming from Satan. *Jack walks off and Abby follows him*\nAbby: Jack, you have got me all wrong. I am not even one of his helpers.\nJack: Well, then, I guess I should compliment you on that clever disguise you've been wearing for the last couple of months.\nAbby: We got started off on the wrong foot. True, I may have been flawed in the past but, I mean, sometimes people can surprise you. You should know a little bit about that yourself. *Cut to Andie in therapy.*\nTherapist: It sounds like you've had a lot on your shoulders for a 16-year-old girl.\nAndie: Yeah, well, after Tim died and Mom, you know, it seemed like there needed to be someone to be the glue to hold the family together and I guess I was the most-likely candidate.\nTherapist: Well, I'm not surprised that you started to feel a bit overwhelmed.\nAndie: Yeah, um, I felt like I was juggling all these balls in the air, you know? And if I dropped one, they'd all come crashing down, and, um, then I'd start thinking about everything all at once and I'd get these panic attacks when my heart was racing and I couldn't breathe...\nTherapist: Andie, Andie. Tell me something. Forget about saving everyone and even forget about your family for a minute. What is it that you want? What do you wish for? For yourself?\nAndie: I wish I could get rid of all my worries. You know? And be one of those people who just sails right through life. You know? And they do what they want to do, whatever makes them happy and they don't care what other people think about them.\nTherapist: Well, then, why couldn't you? I'm going to give you a prescription, Andie, but not for a drug. I prescribe for you one night of imperfection. *Cut to the Icehouse. Bessie hands Joey something.*\nBessie: Here. You can get out of here early. I'm sure you want to get changed before going to Dawson's.\nJoey: Believe me, Bess. It's not going to take me very long to get dressed. It's not like I have to get all gussied up for anybody seeing as though I've turned Jack off from women completely.\nBessie: Joey, you know that's not true.\nJoey: I know. It's not true. I mean, intellectually, I know that it has nothing to do with me. It's--Bessie? What am I supposed to do now?\nBessie: You paint. You concentrate on your art and yourself. I mean, you broke up with Dawson because you wanted to find yourself...and then you went straight into a relationship with Jack. Now's your chance to do what you set out to do. I mean, look. Any girl would be acting the way you do right now under the circumstances. I mean, I think you're handling it with an amazing level of maturity. *They hug. Dawson enters.*\nDawson: Joey, hey. I need to talk to you.\nJoey: Sure... *Joey gets her coat and heads out of the Icehouse with him..*\nJoey: What's up? *Cut to Ty putting ribbon on Dawson's present.*\nJen: Well, looks like you can add arts and crafts to your list of talents. *Ty laughs. Jen walks behind him by the sink and turns around and looks at him.*\nTy: I can feel that.\nJen: What?\nTy: You. Watching me. I mean, you think you're crafty, but I know. I can feel your eyes on me.\nJen: You can not.\nTy: Sometimes. Can't you?\nJen: Nah, I don't know. I've never really tried.\nTy: Close your eyes. *Jen closes her eyes and Ty looks at her.*\nTy: There. Can you feel me looking?\nJen: No. Not yet. *Ty leans in closer.*\nTy: Now?\nJen: No... *They kiss. They break apart and laugh.*\nJen: I was peeking.\nTy: Uh huh... *They start kissing again, Ty breaks away.*\nTy: Uh, morning? Kitchen...Grams. *Jen looks at him confused, kind of suspicious. Cut to Dawson and Joey walking along a pier.*\nJoey: Oh, it's freezing out. I just wish it would snow already.\nDawson: I know.\nJoey: Hey, remember what we used to do when we were kids?\nDawson: What? Make a wish on the first snowfall?\nJoey: Uh huh. And it always came true. *They stop at a roasted peanut vendor*\nDawson: Two.\nJoey: Well, except for the time we wished for a horse, a million dollars, and a trampoline all in the same year....I was greedy, what can I say? *They laugh. They pay for their peanuts.*\nJoey: Thanks.\nVendor: Enjoy it. *They walk off.*\nDawson: Snow is just so...hopeful, you know?\nJoey: Yeah. Hope is good. So...what are you hoping for?\nDawson: I'm hoping that we can get back to the way we were.\nJoey: Me too. And I've been trying to get our friendship back on track--\nDawson: I'm not talking about just our friendship, Joey. Look, I can't deny the truth which is plainly and simply, I want more. I want you back.\nJoey: (shaking her head) Dawson...\nDawson: I was so confused last night but then I realized that the only thing that makes sense in my life is you and I know that it's still there between us. I felt it during the whole Jack saga and I know that you feel it, too, because we're soulmates. Joey, you and I were meant to be. Period. The end. Cue happy ending music.\nJoey: No...look, Dawson. Do you remember why we broke up in the first place? It wasn't about you at all and it certainly wasn't about Jack, it was about me. How I had things I needed to figure out.\nDawson: Things that you were willing to figure out with Jack but not with me.\nJoey: No, Dawson! We can't talk about this, you know why.\nDawson: Joey! If you and me aren't meant to be together than I don't know anything. I wouldn't count on snow today. *He walks off. Cut to Joey, later that night, at the Leery house, stirring punch. Bessie walks in the kitchen.*\nJoey: I can't believe I'm throwing a surprise party for someone who hates me right now.\nBessie: Just relax. I'm sure everything will work itself out. I mean, Dawson's out right now with Pacey, enjoying his birthday, by the time he gets here, he'll probably be in a great mood. *Cut to Dawson staring gloomily out of the window of the patrol car Pacey's driving. Andie's in the back seat.*\nAndie: I have always wanted to sit in the backseat of a cop car. Hey! I know! Let's turn on the sirens!\nPacey: I don't think that's the best idea, Sweetie.\nAndie: (making siren noises) Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo! Book 'em, Dann-o! So this is what it's like when they cart you off to prison, huh?\nDawson: Depends. There's different types. There's the state-regulated ones and then the ones that you're trapped in when your life is going nowhere and everyone else is moving forward.\nPacey: Took a happiness pill this morning, did we, Dawson?\nDawson: No, just a dose of bleak reality. No offense, but have you noticed my only birthday plans are to play third wheel to my friend and his girlfriend?\nPacey: Okay, listen, buddy, on any other day of the year, I'd be more than happy to talk to you about this, but since today's your birthday, why don't we try to concentrate on the positives, alright?\nAndie: HEY! STOP THE CAR! *Pacey slams on the brakes.*\nPacey: What? What'd we hit?\nAndie: Nothing. Just make a U-turn I saw a really cool place back there.\nPacey: Uh, Andie? Could we please keep this impulsive streak that you're trying to indulge tonight from killing everybody in this car? Please, honey?\nAndie: Um, doctor's orders! 'Member, Pacey? You promised I could cut loose tonight.\nPacey: Yes...I did, didn't I? Okay. *Pacey backs the car into a parking lot and makes a U-turn. Cut to Jack outside of the Leery house fixing his new front-part-slicked-up-by-gel 'do. He enters the party and Abby and her friends are standing next to the door.*\nKelly: Oh my God! Jack...you look...amazing.\nAbby: Wow. It's like a transformation from John-boy to John-John, all in a sharp, dippity-do.\nJack: It's no big deal. I put a little gel in my hair. That's pretty much the extent of it.\nAbby: I guess when you get gay, you get style. I wish I would have nabbed you one sexual preference ago. *Jack just looks at her funny and walks off. Cut to Jen taking Dawson's presents into a room. Ty walks in behind her.*\nJen: Hello, Ty.\nTy: Excellent, you're learning.\nJen: Uh huh. *They kiss. Ty pulls away.*\nJen: Okay, explanation.\nTy: What?\nJen: First this morning and now? That's two kisses that you've bailed out on.\nTy: Okay, it's just that we've been getting closer, you know?\nJen: I know. It's called dating.\nTy: I realize that but when does it stop?\nJen: You're kidding, right?\nTy: Jen...you...you turn me on and the closer we get the more you turn me on.\nJen: Is that such a bad thing?\nTy: All I'm saying is that it's possible that things could get out of hand.\nJen: Really? How out of hand?\nTy: I'm serious.\nJen: We've barely made out and you're already worried about things going out of hand? Sweet...in a very 1956 sort-of way.\nTy: Yeah? Well, how 1956 is this? *They start kissing again. Cut to Andie, Dawson, and Pacey at a club. Andie slips off her coat revealing a red spaghetti-strap dress. Pacey notices.*\nPacey: Wo! Who are you and what have you done with my girlfriend?\nAndie: She's been here all along. Just trapped beneath the bondage of Gap clothing and a good-girl complex.\nPacey: Well, the good-girl complex was part of your charm.\nAndie: Part of my charm. Not all of it. Remember we're having fun? Besides, (missed name of therapist) said I need to let my 'it' out to breathe some fresh air for an evening.\nDawson: What exactly are you letting out for an evening?\nAndie: It's what (therapist) calls your 'it'. It's the part of you that holds your purest impulses and desires. It doesn't care what anyone thinks. It just wants what it wants.\nDawson: And what do you think it wants?\nAndie: Well, I think it's about letting go of all your pre-conceived notions of how you're supposed to talk or how you're supposed to behave and just letting loose for once.\nDawson: I could certainly learn something about letting loose. I mean, look at me. I'm sitting in a bar and I'm drinking a straight Coke. *Pacey raises an eyebrow.*\nAndie: We could do it together if you want. I mean, it might be good for both of us to get a little...wild tonight.\nPacey: Try not to get to wild while I'm away at the washroom, alright? *Pacey walks off and the waitress comes to their table.*\nWaitress: Can I get you guys anything else?\nAndie: Yeah, um, I'll have another Coke and could you tell the bartender to put a little more rum in it this time?\nDawson: Yeah, me too, I could barely taste the rum in mine.\nWaitress: Oh, sorry about that! I'll have him double up on the shots the next round to make up for it.\nDawson: Thank you. *She walks off.*\nAndie: (excited) Ahhh! I've never drank before!!\nDawson: Never. *Andie excitedly turns back and watches the stage. Cut to Jack out on the porch. Abby comes out.*\nAbby: So..how does it feel to be the one who set this little (missed word) on it's heels?\nJack: Why do you keep talking to me? I don't like you, Abby.\nAbby: Well, that's because no one likes me. I'm an outcast. Welcome to the club. *Jack laughs and walks back towards the door to go inside.*\nAbby: This whole thing is just ridiculous. There's no such thing as gay anyway. *Jack stops.*\nAbby: It's just the name people came up with to persecute the normal inclination to go both ways.\nJack: What do you--What do you mean?\nAbby: Well, we're all bisexual, don't you think? We're all just sexual animals under God. This pure atomical society would think our natural impulses are something to be ashamed of when it's really those kind-of attitudes that are the embarrassment.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n*Cut to Pacey, Andie, and Dawson at the bar, Andie and Dawson are obviously drunk.*\nWaitress: How are we doing?\nDawson: I think we're ready for another round.\nAndie: Sounds good to me!\nWaitress: Okay, two more coming right up. *She walks off.*\nPacey: How many Cokes are you guys going to swill tonight? *Dawson and Andie both shrug drunkedly.*\nEmployee: Well, alright, as you can probably tell, it's open mike night tonight so who wants to come up here and sing the blues for us?\nDawson: I know a little something about the blues.\nAndie: Alright! C'mon, then! Let's go!\nPacey: Uhhhh...I don't think that's the best idea, don't you, sweetheart?\nAndie: Sure it is! *Dawson and Andie walk up on stage.*\nPacey: Ohh boy... *On the stage.*\nDawson: Alright, boys, the blues! *The band starts playing the blues and Andie starts dancing and Dawson adjusts the mike and laughs. Then, he starts singing.*\nDawson: (singing) My name is Dawson Leery. I'm feeling kind of weary. Today is my birthday. You all look a little blurry. The girl I cared for, Left me and ran away, Straight into the arms of, A GUY THAT TURNED OUT TO BE GAY! I got the blues! Yeah! Today I woke up feeling like I was born to lose! Yeaaah I got the bluuuuueeesss. Somedays you're born to lose! (stops singing) Here's my friend Andie, she's going to sing you a song because she's got the blues!!!!\nAndie: (singing) My name is Andie. And my brother's the one that's gay. My other brother died. And my daddy ran away! But I'm still Andie. And my boyfriend makes me randy His name is Pacey, AND MY MOM'S GONE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!! Yeaaaaaaaaaaaah I've got the bluesssssssss!\nDawson: Sing it sister!\nAndie: (singing) Sometimes you swear you were born to loooooosssssssseeeeeeee!\nDawson: (singing) Oh, we got the bluesss! Now it's time to put on my dancing shoes! Whoooooo! Yeaaaaaaaaahh! Alright! Oh, I've been restless, hopeless and confused, This girl that I told you about, She's been on the move, She's at my surrrrprise party where everyone I know is at right now, And when I show up late they're GONNA HAVE A COW! Yeaaaaaaaaahhhhhh I got the bluuuuuuuueeeeeeeesssss! I swear sometimes we were born to lose!\nAndie: No, brother man, WE got the blues.\nAndie & Dawson: (singing) We got the bluuueeeessss!\nDawson: (singing) Sometimes you're, you were born to lose! Ohhhhh yeah. *Everybody claps. Andie and Dawson walk back to their table. Pacey gets up and gets Andie's coat.*\nPacey: Well, what do you say we end this evening on a high note and get off to that not-so surprise party.\nDawson: I think we're having a dirty, no-good time right here.\nAndie: Hear, hear!!! *Pacey sits back down.*\nPacey: What's gotten into you two tonight?\nAndie: Well, it's his birthday!\nDawson: That's right!\nAndie: So what do you want to do next? *Pacey takes a drink of Andie's Coke.*\nPacey: So you guys have been drinking!\nDawson: Excuse me, waitress! Make it a double this time with just a splash of Coke. You know what, I think a splash is too much, make it just a spla. No shhhhhh at all.\nAndie: No sh.\nWaitress: Before I bring you anything else the bartender asked me to check your IDs.\nAndie: *laughs* Check our IDs?! You should of done that, like, 5 drinks ago because you know what? We are 16 years old!! *Dawson laughs and puts his finger to his lips \"shush\"ing Andie.*\nAndie: No, we are! And you know what? You, Little Missy, have just broken the law! You could lose your job over this! Not only could you lose your job but you guys could lose your liquor license! And, you know what, this is my boyfriend and his father is the town sheriff and how would--\nPacey: No, no. *He taps Dawson on the shoulder, who's been laughing this whole time, to get up.*\nPacey: Hey, she's kidding. It's a joke. It's a joke. *Pacey's dragging them out of the bar.*\nAndie: No, I'm not! I have my ID right here. Wanna see it?\nPacey: Let's go. What were you thinking, huh? *Cut to the party. Mitch walks towards Gail by the punch bowl.*\nMitch: So I was out in the garage and I saw the Explorer. Very beautiful. A nice gift. Except I only thought that Dawson's first car would be more like the one I had when I was a boy. Like some old jalopy or something. Of course it's your decision.\nGail: It seems that most of the decisions that came with the marriage are mine these days, except, of course, the decision about the marriage itself. *Cut to the Explorer in the garage with steam-covered windows. All of a sudden in a Titanic-like scene someone's hand hits the glass. Cut to inside the car, Jen and Ty are making out.*\nTy: Okay, okay, we have to stop. I can't do this. I'm sorry Jen.\nJen: You should be.\nTy: It's not entirely my fault.\nJen: Oh, really. What role am I playing in your personal inner struggle?\nTy: You're tempting me.\nJen: That's a load of crap.\nTy: I'm sorry, Jen, but as attracted as I am to you. I don't believe in pre-marital s*x and no matter what you say or do is not going to convince me that it's right.\nJen: Who said anything about s*x? *Jen climbs out of the Explorer. Ty follows.*\nTy: Jen, I mean it's perfectly clear that your history of kissing isn't just kissing! *Jen angrily whips around surprised.*\nJen: My history?!\nTy: Jen, we're types of people and just as I'm likely to be found in church on Sunday--\nJen: I'm more of a Saturday night slut?!\nTy: I didn't say that.\nJen: Then how come I have never felt more like one? *Cut to Jack standing alone on the stairs inside the Leery house. Abby walks up to him.*\nAbby: His own party and he's not even here yet, what a guy.\nJack: Do you really think it's true what you said earlier? About everyone having bisexual inclinations?\nAbby: Oh, absolutely. *Cut to them in Dawson's room.*\nAbby: You know, the Dawson and Joey's of the universe are pretty advanced for their age but with all the time they spend examining their navals, you'd think they'd be more open to the possibilities. *Jack lifts up his shirt a little and looks at his naval.*\nJack: You know, you're right! There's a whole world of possibilites in there. *They laugh. Abby looks at hers.*\nAbby: In here, too. *She sits down on the bed.*\nJack: Yeah, maybe you're not Satan after all. Of course, I don't think Satan has a belly button. *He sits down next to her.*\nAbby: Well, us outcasts have to learn how to stick together. *Cut to back downstairs, Joey walks by carrying a bowl when Dawson, Andie, and Pacey burst through the door.*\nDawson: SURPRISE! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! *Dawson and Andie head for another room and Joey walks up to Pacey.*\nJoey: You're late. This party's a disaster.\nPacey: Don't get me started.\nJoey: Are they...?\nPacey: Yes, rum in Cokes, they got past me. *Cut to Andie and Dawson standing on top of the kitchen table dancing.*\nJoey: C'mon you guys.\nAndie: What? You wanna dance? *Joey helps Dawson down and Pacey grabs Andie. Cut to Joey leading Dawson down a hallway.*\nDawson: HEY! It's my birthday! I can do whatever I want to do!\nJoey: Yeah, but we need to go where your parents can't see you. *Dawson stumbles on the stairs and Joey helps him up. He spots some people on the stairs.*\nDawson: HEY! WHAT'S UUUUUP?\nJoey: We're going to get some coffee in your system. God knows it probably won't help but it's the only thing I can think of right now.\nDawson: I've got the blues, Jo. Do you know anything about the blues?\nJoey: More than I care to. *They walk into Dawson's room to find Jack kissing Abby. Dawson starts laughing hysterically. He plays the air guitar*\nDawson: (singing) THE GUY I WAS TALKING ABOUT, WHO SAID HE WAS GAY, I KNOW SATURDAY, HE DECIDED TO SWING BOTH WAYS!!!!!!!!!! *Dawson falls back on his bed playing air guitar and Abby's laughing.*\nJack: Joey.\nJoey: I can't deal with this, okay? *Joey leaves and Jack follows her out.*\nDawson: (singing to Abby) Sometimes you were born to lose. *She laughs. Cut to Joey coming down the stairs. Jack's following her. Abby's following him.*\nJack: Joey!\nAbby: (to Kelly and Jaycee) Not so gay anymore.\nJack: More gay than ever. *Cut to Gail bring Dawson's cake over. Dawson walks in.*\nGail: Aw, perfect timing, honey, I was just about to call you as soon as I lit the candles.\nDawson: What? Time to make a wish?\nGail: Dawson, honey, have you been drinking?\nDawson: Time to make a wish, okay...let's make a wish. *Everyone's quiet and listening to him.*\nDawson: I wish..I wish that my mom never slept with her co-anchor. I wish that my father would stop talking about actually getting a job and go out and get one! I wish the two of you would stop your petty bickering and at least pretend to be the adults around here! I wish that my friend Pacey would just end this transformation of this A-student, do-gooder, all-around sanctamonious angel and would go back to what he does best which is make me feel good about my life when his is supposed to be worse. And then there's Jen Lindley with her drunkedness and her revolving boyfriends and her wild, wicked ways. I want to party with you! Ah, and then there's Jack McPhee. Jack McPhee who likes guys but doesn't mind stealing my girlfriend! Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, starring in his very own version of In & Out. He's in, he's out! He's in! He's out! In, out! Nice hair by the way. And then, of course, there's my Joey. My sweet, precious Joey. The only 16-year-old in the world that needed to find herself. But you know what? That's okay. I accept it. You need to find yourself, and I accept it. *He turns around.*\nDawson: (cont.) So Joey! Joey? *He starts looking everywhere, under tables, around people.*\nDawson: (cont.) Excuse me? Where's my Joey? Joey! There she is! There's my Joey! *He walks over to her and kisses her. She pushes him away.*\nJoey: Cut it out, Dawson! *He falls into the cake. Cut to Dawson throwing up in the sink and Andie hunched over the toilet.*\nAndie: Oh, God. This is all my fault. Or is it my It's fault? Is it my fault?\nDawson: I've learned one thing from my iniation into the evils of alcohol. Be careful what you eat because you're going to see it again.\nAndie: And again and again and again. Oh, God, I swear I am never drinking again.Oh, God, I am so mortified at my behavior tonight and to think your parents saw me this way!\nDawson: I swear if I survive this night, and if any of my family or friends every speak to me again, I swear I'll never let another drop of alcohol touch my lips.\nAndie: And if you ever see me pick up a drink, please remind me of how I'm feeling right now.\nDawson: Deal. *Dawson and Andie quickly look at each other before hunching over to puke again. Cut to Gail going out on the porch with Mitch.*\nMitch: Have we completely screwed up our son's life?\nGail: No, he's 16 years old. You remember being 16, don't you?\nMitch: All to well.\nGail: Well, I'm taking the Explorer back to the dealer tomorrow. His behavior tonight shows me that he's not ready for the responsibility of a new car. It was, I admit, possibly not the soundest decision that I've ever made.\nMitch: We could, um, go in on some old car together if you want.\nGail: Sounds like a plan. Maybe we could cover the down payment and he could work to pay off the rest. Maybe he'd learn something about the value of money and mistakes.\nMitch: Well, I guess we're all still learning about that. *Cut to Jack walking down the dock towards Joey.*\nJack: Hey.\nJoey: Hey. You know, it's bad enough that I organized the world's worst surprise party, Jack, but Abby? I mean, after what she did to your family and everyone else...I don't know, I guess I just thought that if you were to go straight again you would chose someone like...Cindy Crawford or something.\nJack: Everyone's been telling me how okay they are with me coming out. You, Pacey, that (missed word), that guidance counselor...\nJoey: I'm sorry for being so accepting...would you rather everyone just turn against you?\nJack: No, it's--she said some things tonight that made me feel like I was just like everyone else. I guess I just saw what I could have become, this whole thing, someone on the fringes like Abby.\nJoey: So if we hadn't of walked in...\nJack: I still would've stopped. I knew it from the minute I started that I was--that I am gay.\nJoey: You know, Jack, I think everyone feels alone and wants to be normal and I don't think anyone really ever does.\nJack: I don't want to be singled out, you know? Like I have some scarlet 'G' on my chest. You know? The Ellen of Capeside.\nJoey: We're all going through the painful process of growing up. You just have this extra layer of difficulty but you're incredibly lucky to have people who support you. Don't lose sight of that.\nJack: Yeah...I guess the thought of being gay...seemed like such a lonely thought. I just don't want to end up alone. *Cut to Jen walking into her porch where Ty is sitting there, waiting.*\nTy: I don't think we should see each other anymore.\nJen: So you waited on a freezing cold porch to tell me something that was perfectly clear two hours ago?\nTy: I just need to explain myself.\nJen: No, you don't. You have natural, God-given impulses that everybody in your life has told you are wrong to follow. So instead of growing your own conscience you try to drag me through your own grief and I'm not going to stand for it.\nTy: Jen! Jen! You need to understand that all my life has been about the church. The beliefs, the teachings, they're all I know.\nJen: So let me get this straight. You're a Christian but you like to booze it up and you like to party, right? You judge people for being gay and you go around saying heterosexual s*x is the way of the lord but you won't actually have heterosexual s*x.\nTy: Look, I know it sounds complicated. I'm struggling with the fact that I am a teenage guy with all of the struggles that go along with that. Desires that are in direct opposition to everything that I've been taught to believe and when I'm with you, all sense of reason just flies out of my head because you're so beautiful and sexy and I want you so badly. I am so sorry that I hurt your feelings tonight. Please understand that this is about me and has nothing to do with you.\nJen: Ty, this has everything to do with me. I liked you.\nTy: Yeah, I know.\nJen: No, you don't! I mean, I really liked you. And despite what you may think about my past experiences, my kissing you tonight was not my desire for something more. It was for something pure, something that I haven't felt in a long time, and you ruined that.\nTy: Maybe..maybe someday when I deal with my baggage maybe this can work out.\nJen: Anybody that can make me feel like this doesn't deserve a maybe. *She shuts the door in his face. Cut to Dawson laying on his bed. Joey walks in.*\nJoey: Hey.\nDawson: Hey.\nJoey: How you doin'?\nDawson: Oh, I'll be fine...after the room stops spinning.\nJoey: I'm sure you'll be better in the morning.\nDawson: God, Joey, whatever I said I am so sorry. I was a complete idiot.\nJoey: Don't worry about it, Dawson. I forgive you. I mean, even you are allowed to make a few mistakes in this world and I'm sure that everyone else will forgive you eventually, too. You pretty much told the truth anyway.\nDawson: Yeah, but the way I did it....God, I am so lonely. I'm 16 years old and I'm so hopelessly lonely.\nJoey: Is that why you got drunk?\nDawson: Yeah...Jo, why did you break up with me and run straight to Jack?\nJoey: Because he wasn't you. Look, it was never about looking for something better, Dawson. It was about looking for someone who wasn't so close to me. Where I could tell where I ended and he began. I mean, our lives have always been so intertwined that in many ways I feel like you partially invented me, Dawson. And that scares me so much. I need to find out if I can be a whole person without you. I need to find out if I can be a whole person....alone.\nDawson: Well, do it quickly, okay? Because....God, I love you. *Joey closes her eyes trying to keep control and Dawson closes his, falling asleep.*\nJoey: (whispers) I love you too, Dawson. *She looks out towards the window and then back at Dawson and gets up and walks towards it. Outside it's snowing. Joey watches the snow, closes her eyes and makes a wish.*\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Cut to Veronica and Piz in the Food Court at Hearst College.\nPIZ: I know what I like. Why waste my time?\nVERONICA: Like, why bother with something not good just because it's something?\nLogan catches Veronica outside Tim's office in 315 \"Papa's Cabin.\"\nLOGAN: You know, I was thinking of asking Parker out, and I wanted to make sure it was cool with you. She puts on a brave face.\nVERONICA: Of course. Thank you for asking.\nLOGAN: Sure. I know we're friends.\nVeronica nods.\nVERONICA: Yeah. Veronica points to Tim's office.\nVERONICA: See ya. And good luck. End previously.\nINT - HEARST COLLEGE, FOOD COURT - DAY.\nVeronica is standing in a queue. She's pensive, playing with a strand of hair. There are three couples in front of her in the queue between her and the person at the front of it -- Logan.\nSERVER: What can I get you?\nLOGAN: Uh, coffee with cream.\nLogan looks back at Veronica. He turns back to the woman at the counter.\nLOGAN: Actually, could I get a couple of them?\nSERVER: Sure.\nShe hands him the coffees.\nLOGAN: Thank you. Logan walks back to the end of the queue.\nLOGAN: Here. He slips one of the cups into her hand, almost surreptitiously.\nLOGAN: I hate to think of you under-decaffeinated. She smiles as she takes it.\nVERONICA: Danke. They walk away from the counter together.\nVERONICA: It's 8am. Shouldn't you be in a wet suit somewhere? He shrugs and grins.\nLOGAN: Early Poly Sci.\nVERONICA: And you're actually going?\nLOGAN: Yeah. I even bought this amazing pen that accents text in neon colours.\nVeronica gasps exaggeratedly.\nVERONICA: A highlighter!\nLOGAN: Lots of advancements since the last time I buckled down. How 'bout you?\nVERONICA: Uh, \"Violence in Early Adolescence.\"\nLOGAN: Ah. Need me to autograph your textbook?\nVERONICA: Thanks, but...\nVeronica trails off and points to her coffee.\nVERONICA: So, what do I owe you for the cup of joe?\nLOGAN: Nah, just pay-it-forward.\nLogan hesitates briefly before hurrying on nonchalantly.\nLOGAN: Hey, by the way, I'm throwing a birthday party for Parker this weekend. I was studying up; I watched My Super Sweet 16. Which reminds me, you don't know where I can get a dozen eunuchs, do you?\nVERONICA: Not offhand. I could make some calls.\nVeronica fakes a laugh to keep up the mutually casual banter in which they are indulging.\nLOGAN: Hmm. Well, if you're not busy, I know she'd really like you to be there. We both would. Think about it. Logan walks away, leaving Veronica staring after him.\nINT - MARS INVESTIGATIONS - DAY.\nThe fish are swimming happily in the tank in Keith's office. Veronica finishes feeding them and walks back to Keith's desk. She checks some papers on which she is working. Footsteps sound in the outer office and an Arab woman, Sabirah Krimani, appears at the open door.\nSABIRAH: Is Mr. Mars in?\nVERONICA: No, sorry. We've shut down for a while.\nThe woman is disappointed.\nVERONICA: You own Babylon Gardens, don't you? She nods.\nVERONICA: My dad and I get takeout there all the time. I went to high school with your daughter. Sabirah Krimani steps forward, disinterested in small talk.\nSABIRAH: Our restaurant was vandalised. Rocks through our window. They spray-painted \"Terrorist\" on our door. Is there someone who can help us? Veronica's eyes glint with determination and she smiles.\nVERONICA: I believe there is.\nINT - THE BREAK - NIGHT.\nThe Break is a busy bar with loud music playing. The most prominent sign in the bar besides the one declaring the bars name is a notice declaring Thursday nights as \"College Night.\" A young man is slumped at the bar counter. A hand pushes a pad of paper and a pen at him.\nMURPHY: Jimmy! The boy doesn't move. The bar owner, Mr. Murphy, slaps his arm to rouse him.\nMURPHY: Hey, your tab. Hey, come on. Jimmy lifts his head up.\nMURPHY: Sign it and hit the road. Jimmy grabs the pen and pad and signs it. He grabs the nearly empty glass of beer in front of him and drains it as he slides off the barstool. He pushes himself away from the bar as Murphy collects the pad.\nEXT - THE BREAK - NIGHT.\nJimmy staggers outside and crosses the road without looking. A car honks his horn, but Jimmy's slow and only action is to hold up his hands in front of his face. The screen whitens in the glare of headlights to the sound of the sickening thud as the car hits him.\nEXT - BABYLON GARDENS - NIGHT.\nFrom inside the restaurant, Sabirah turns the sign on the door from \"Come in, we're open\" to \"Sorry, we're closed.\"\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: Tomorrow I'll set the cameras. Tonight it's the old-fashioned stake-out. Veronica is in her car, parked opposite the restaurant on the other side of the street, watching the front of the building.\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: I took this case so I wouldn't have time to dwell on Parker's birthday party and now, here I am, sitting in a car with nothing but a whole lot of dwelling time on my hands. Veronica jumps slightly at the soft knock on the passenger side window made by the girl who has appeared at the side of the car. She looks over at the intruder and rolls down the window. The girl leans into the car.\nAMIRA: Veronica Mars? VERONICA: Amira. Long time, no see. AMIRA: Yeah. Like since my senior year, when you made my Pirate Points worth less. VERONICA: Wow. Good memory. The two girls share polite smiles.\nVERONICA: I heard you were at Hearst, but I haven't seen ya.\nAMIRA: Yeah, different circles, I guess. What are you doing out here?\nVERONICA: Your mom hired me to watch the place in case there are any more...incidents.\nAmira laughs in disbelief.\nAMIRA: My mom hired you? Veronica nods.\nVERONICA: Yep.\nAMIRA: Have a blast.\nAmira backs away from the car and Veronica closes the window with the touch of a button.\nINT - THE BREAK - NIGHT.\nThe bar is now empty but for Murphy, who is cashing up, and Keith who approaches the bar counter.\nKEITH: I just got off the phone with County. The kid's never going to walk again. Any idea what a nineteen-year-old was doing drinking in here?\nMURPHY: His ID said he was twenty-one.\nKEITH: Yeah, I saw it. It also said he was six three, two twenty, and blond.\nMurphy shrugs helplessly in a \"What you gonna do\" way. Keith is unimpressed.\nEXT - BABYLON GARDENS - NIGHT.\nThe door of the restaurant bursts open and a man comes out, followed by Sabirah. This is Rashad, Sabirah's husband and Amira's father. He waves at Veronica in her car across the street, beckoning her. As Veronica opens the door to get out, he shouts to her.\nRASHAD: You can go home now. We will pay for the time that you put in. Veronica strides towards them..\nRASHAD: But I can handle it myself. It was a mistake for my wife to hire you.\nSABIRAH: It was not a mistake.\nVeronica stands before them, a little uncomfortable as they argue.\nSABIRAH: You fall asleep out here in your car. You work too hard to be able to stay up all night.\nRASHAD: This is the Mars girl. Her father is the acting sheriff. Have you thought about Nasir? Besides, this is no job for a girl, a classmate of Amira's.\nAmira is also outside, watching the debate quietly.\nSABIRAH: What choice did I have? I knew you would react this way. Surprise. In the street, there's a loud shout and the sound of a fast-approaching engine. Veronica looks up and to her left to see a yellow pick-up truck bearing down on them. A couple of the occupants are standing in the back, aiming at them with sights that have lights on them. Operatic-like music swells. Shots are fired. A laser sight and a splurge of red appears on Rashad's chest as he staggers at the impact. Sabirah screams. Amira turns to run but is hit in the back. Veronica dives out of the way of the speeding vehicle, landing hard on the pavement. Veronica looks down at her coat. She's been hit by yellow paint. She glares at the departing truck. Opening credits.\nINT - BABYLON GARDENS - NIGHT.\nNow inside the restaurant, Veronica groans at the pain in her shoulder where she was hit by the paintball. Amira passes behind her, staring at her now-removed sweater in regret.\nAMIRA: Ack. Cashmere! Rashad is angry and pacing.\nRASHAD: Why is this happening?\nVERONICA: Not a great time to be Arab in America.\nRASHAD: Twenty years we've been in this country! Huh?\nHe picks up a small flag from a set on the counter and waves it..\nRASHAD: Twenty years, we've been Americans. I make Yankee Doodle Damn Dandee. He gestures wildly at a poster on the wall, under another American flag. It's an Uncle Sam poster with Rashad's face PhotoShopped in under the message \"I want you for Babylon Garden's [sic].\"\nRASHAD: And now this?\nVERONICA: The license plate was removed, but I caught a glimpse of a bumper sticker. It should be enough to go on.\nAMIRA: [sceptically] Really? Unless it was a \"Hello, my name is...\" sticker, how's that gonna do any good?\nVERONICA: The person who owns that pick-up has a child who's an honour student at Neptune Middle. Do you want me to track him down or not?\nRashad looks over at his wife and daughter helplessly before looking back at Veronica.\nINT - MARS RESIDENCE - NIGHT.\nVeronica enters the apartment. Keith is sitting at the kitchen counter reading a newspaper.\nKEITH: [with disgust] Look at these ads. Veronica shuts the door behind her and joins him at the counter.\nKEITH: \"Two for Tuesday,\" \"It's Raining Gin\"... Keith is looking at a page of advertisements for bars. Genski's promises a \"Suds 'n Study Sat\" with Mexican bottles and draft pints at $2 together with a \"Bucket 'O Beer Bonanza\"! The Sand Bar uses George Washington's portrait to advertise its \"Dollar Shots Night.\"\nKEITH: \"Dollar Shots Night\"...\nVERONICA: Let me change first. Man, you party hard.\nVeronica saunters off towards her room, ignorant or ignoring Keith's serious mood.\nKEITH: It's a college paper. Only a quarter of the students at Hearst are twenty-one. Veronica turns back to him and sags against the counter.\nVERONICA: [tiredly] I'm not sure where this rant is going.\nKEITH: A nineteen-year-old kid was drinking at a bar called The Break tonight with a gumball-level ID. He stumbled out and a car hit him. It looks like he'll never walk again.\nKeith returns his attention to the ads.\nKEITH: \"Bucket 'O Beer Bonanza\"... You have any idea if they're known for underage drinking? Veronica laughs.\nVERONICA: Famous for is more like it. It's nicknamed The Cake for how easy it is to get in but most of the campus area bars are pretty lax. Veronica clearly doesn't see this as any big deal but notes Keith glaring at her.\nVERONICA: From what I've heard, 'cause the only buckets I order come in original and extra crispy. She heads for her bedroom. Keith stares after her.\nINT - SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY.\nDeputy Sacks hands out sheets of paper to the other eleven deputies gathered in the main office. Keith is facing them, leaning back against the main counter.\nKEITH: I have it on good authority that The Break and other campus-area bars on the list you're receiving are knowingly serving underage students. I want surprise checks in every one of these bars tonight. Deputy Gills glances at the list.\nGILLS: Looks like my credit card statement. The deputies laugh and Keith smiles indulgently.\nSACKS: What's the priority level, Sheriff?\nKEITH: Well, obviously if you get a call, take it, but otherwise, I want these bars scared straight.\nThe deputies start to break away, less than enthused.\nKEITH: Gentlemen. Jim Wilson was nineteen. I want this taken seriously.\nDEPUTY: Yes, sir.\nThe other deputies mutter their acquiescence. Gills heads for Sacks to have a quiet word.\nGILLS: You used to work for him. Is he always like this? Sacks folds his arms and glances at Keith.\nSACKS: I wouldn't test him. Gills looks over at Keith himself before wandering away.\nINT - NEPTUNE MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY.\nA teacher holds her hand up in front of a class of boys and girls, aged about twelve.\nMRS. HILLS: We have a guest in honours homeroom today. Miss Mars is doing a survey about gun awareness for her college criminology course. Veronica is standing at the front of the class next to Mrs. Hills. She gives a little wave.\nMRS. HILLS: I trust you will give her your full attention as honour points are in effect. Mrs. Hills steps to the side of the room, leaving Veronica at the front of the class. One of the students raises his hand. Veronica points to him.\nRONALD: What does a criminologist do?\nVERONICA: Oh, grads usually go into work in law enforcement. I'm considering pursuing a career at the FBI.\nRONALD: [scoffing] You're a girl.\nMRS. HILLS: [sharply] Ronald.\nVERONICA: Actually, Ronald, did you know that on average, girls develop faster than boys and have higher levels of cognitive functioning, including math calculation, written language, and verbal fluency?\nRonald isn't impressed and shrugs.\nRONALD: So? Veronica smiles and points towards him.\nVERONICA: Well put, Ronald. We need fireman, too. The students in the class, particularly the girls, chuckle appreciatively.\nVERONICA: We all know guns are dangerous, but I also study the dangers and implications of the impact of toy guns, like pellet guns, BB guns, or paintball guns. Raise your hand if you have a family member who owns a pellet or BB gun. A number of the students raise their hands.\nVERONICA: Now, how about paintball guns? Four students put their hand up.\nVERONICA: Okay, now, whose family has a big, yellow pick-up truck. Mrs Hills' smile disappears as she digests this. She looks over at Veronica quizzically.\nMRS. HILLS: Miss Mars? I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand where this is going. Veronica ignores her until she gets a good look at the one child whose hand is in the air. The boy look Arabic.\nVERONICA: Yep. Me either.\nEXT - NEPTUNE STREET - DAY.\nA school bus drives off, having delivered the boy to a house outside of which stands the yellow pick-up truck. Veronica, pulled up on the other side of the road, watches him as he goes into the house. She pouts, confused. She grabs her stuff and exits the car, walking up the pathway to the house. She stops and looks around as if she's heard something but it's not until she starts moving again that we hear the distant sounds of the laughter of game-playing youths.\nVOICES: Oh, ho, ho, man! You got hit again! All right! Okay, okay, it's cool. Shoot-shoot! There you go! Yes! Yes! Veronica follows the sounds of voices to a structure at the side of the house. There's a warning sign on the door and a window at the top. She peers in. She sees two guys watching a third play a video game. On the wall next to the door, she sees paintball guns. Inside the room (which has another Danny Mo poster decorating the wall), there's a fourth boy also watching the stoned-out gameplayer.\nVOICES: Oh, God, what are you doing, man! Watch out for-! Ohhh. Intent on the game, they notice nothing until a splatter of paint hits the television screen. They react in shock, jumping up and turning around to face Veronica, now armed with a paintball gun. An Arabic-looking boy of around seventeen confronts her.\nBRETT: Yo, bitch, what up? Veronica responds by firing the gun. He jerks back as a splodge of neon green paint hits him square in the chest.\nVERONICA: Stings. I know, because you shot me last night. Brett has the grace to look abashed.\nVERONICA: I've got some bad news for you boys. I'm close with the local sheriff and he simply hates hate crimes. Self-hate in your case. Brett looks bemused. The stoned guy behind him has only just caught up with events.\nTOWELIE: Dude, she shot you.\nVERONICA: Keep up, Towlie.\nBRETT: Self-hate? What?\nVERONICA: Spray painting the front of Babylon Gardens? Ringing any bells?\nBRETT: What?\nVeronica parrots Jules in Pulp Fiction.\nVERONICA: Say what again, I dare ya. I double dare ya.\nBRETT: What?\nVeronica shoots him again, this time in the shoulder. He grabs the spot with a groan.\nBRETT: Ah, God! Someone wrote \"terrorist\" at Babylon Gardens?\nVERONICA: [a la Jules] Check out the big brain on Brett! I'll give you a hint. It was you.\nBRETT: We didn't do anything like that!\nVeronica lifts the gun and takes aim.\nBRETT: [desperately] I can prove it. Veronica lowers the gun. Cut to later. On the television screen are shots taken by a camera from the pick-up truck as the guys shoot random people in the streets.\nBRETT: Look! White people. On screen, a couple are targeted to the sound of whoops and hollars from the boys.\nBRETT: You see? Anyone's a target.\nVERONICA: So I'm straight. Your defence is that you shoot everyone, not just Arabs.\nBrett shrugs. Veronica's attention is caught by something she sees on screen.\nVERONICA: Is that Mr. Clemmons? On screen, it is indeed Van Clemmons, attacked by them as he walks towards his car.\nCLEMMONS: [on the video] Ow, ow, ow, ow.\nTOWELIE: Yeah, nailing Clemmons was sweet.\nThe two boys behind him are smirking. They all jump when Towelie is hit in the chest by a paintball. He's so out of it that it takes a couple of beats before he even reacts to the pain. The other boys laugh.\nBRETT: Do I look like someone who would spray paint \"terrorist\" on a Middle Eastern restaurant? Veronica gives him a hard look before accepting this. She still has the paintball gun at the ready.\nVERONICA: Fine. Give me the DVD. Brett bends down to collect it from the player.\nVERONICA: Anymore drive-bys and that finds its way back to the sheriff. Now. Everyone grab their Visine. You have an appointment.\nEXT - BABYLON GARDENS - DAY.\nBrett looks up sullenly as he, Towelie and one of the other boys clean the pavement of paint immediately outside the restaurant. Rashad is standing over them.\nRASHAD: Hey, you! I still see some green by the door jamb. Towelie gets up and heads for the indicated area where the fourth boy is already working. Rashad turns and looks up at Veronica who is up on a stepladder, fixing a camera.\nRASHAD: Are you sure these aren't the same vandals who did the spray painting? Veronica climbs down the stepladder.\nVERONICA: Pretty sure. She carries on past him, and Sabirah comes out of the restaurant, carrying a small cloth banner.\nSABIRAH: Are you sure we should hang one on the door again? I mean, are we asking for trouble?\nRASHAD: I won't be intimidated, Sabirah.\nShe's unconvinced and turns to Veronica, who is checking out the playback from the cameras on her computer.\nSABIRAH: What do you think? They stole the last one we put up.\nRASHAD: Don't ask her. This isn't about her.\nVeronica turns to look at the banner as Sabirah shoos her husband to shut up. Veronica returns her attention to the computer as she responds.\nVERONICA: If it was me, I'd put one up twice as big. Rashad grins, as does Veronica. On her screen, the cameras she has installed are working, showing the boys continuing in their work.\nRASHAD: You see? Two to one. Democracy in action. He takes the banner from his wife, who smiles.\nINT - NEPTUNE GRAND HOTEL, LOGAN'S SUITE - NIGHT.\nDick is sitting on the couch, his laptop on the ottoman in front of him. Logan walks around the back of the couch. He glances down at Dick as he adjusts his necklace.\nLOGAN: Hey, I gotta run some errands for the party. Thanks for all your help, by the way. Dick, oblivious to the complaint, leans back with satisfaction.\nDICK: Check it out. Two hot chicks I met on MySpace. Both in play. Both eager to meet the Dickster face-to-face. Question. And I need you to dig deep here. Which one do I invite? Logan, having put on his watch and grabbed his phone, leans down to get a better look at the screen. The page for the first girl is up. Dick adds the second page so pictures of both can be seen.\nLOGAN: Um...hmm. Lazy eye might work to your advantage.\nDICK: Ha! Trick question! Just goes to show how whipped you are. The correct answer is \"both.\"\nLOGAN: And if they both show?\nDICK: Then I do a quick heat check. Whichever's engine's running hotter gets Dick.\nLogan heads out as Dick continues to stare at the objects of his interest.\nLOGAN: You mean \"whomever's.\"\nDICK: Whatever.\nINT - SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - NIGHT.\nKeith and Deputy Gills talk quietly up at the counter in the darkened office.\nGILLS: What can I say? We hit them all, full sweeps. They were clean.\nKEITH: Deputy Gills, you don't find it strange? College towns, surprise inspections, and not one of my deputies issues a single citation?\nSacks, working at his desk, glances up at them with interest, but firmly keeping his head down.\nGILLS: Not really. Those bars do a good job of keeping the minors out. I hate to say it but the kid who got hit? He's the exception.\nKEITH: [softly sarcastic] What are the odds?\nINT - MARS RESIDENCE - DAY.\nVeronica sinks onto her desk chair and checks her computer.\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: So let's see how Babylon Gardens survived the night without me. She pulls up the video from the surveillance camera.\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: All seems well. She speeds it forward. At one point during the night, a figure is seen at the window of the restaurant. Veronica slows the playback down to normal speed.\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: Who is this guy and what's he doing skulking around? It's a young man just loitering outside the restaurant. He's wearing a sweatshirt that has the number eleven on the back and \"Sneed Batmen\" on the front. Veronica freezes the picture.\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: \"Sneed Batmen\"?\nINT - HEARST COLLEGE, FOOD COURT - DAY.\nMusic: \"Trina\" by Public Bulletin.\nLYRICS: As Trina walks, as Trina talks Trina falls in love She [?] image She thinks she'd done enough Beautiful poster is tacked above her head\nHow many times, how many rhymes Justify your feelings Sent to her at night Jambox promises that love will find a way It can't promise love will stay Trina watch it all subside Songs that you listen to are lies\nThe Food Court is busy, with all the tables in use. Veronica and Mac are occupying one of them.\nVERONICA: Does \"Sneed Batmen\" ring any bells? For some reason, it sounds familiar. Mac is staring into space and doesn't respond.\nVERONICA: Hello? Mac's eyes jerk to focus on Veronica.\nVERONICA: Sneed?\nMAC: Sorry. Bronson and I went on a hike this morning. I'm wiped.\nVERONICA: A hike? You?\nMAC: [defiantly] Yes.\nVERONICA: Morning? You?\nMAC: I wanted to see what it was like.\nVERONICA: And?\nMAC: [unenthusiatically] It's sunny.\nVERONICA: Mmm. Sounds like things are good with Bronson. Any better and he'd have you jump the fiery hoops.\nMac glares at her. She then spots something over Veronica's shoulder.\nMAC: You ready? Mac nods to behind Veronica.\nMAC: We can offer them our table. Veronica looks over her shoulder. Logan and Parker have their trays of food and are looking for somewhere to sit. Parker is giggling. Veronica is not happy but puts on a face for Mac.\nVERONICA: Sure. Mac waves them over.\nPARKER: Hey, you guys. Thanks for the table.\nMAC: It just takes me back to high school. Remember, Logan? We stood at the same lunch table and made fun of all the fat kids.\nLOGAN: I'm sorry. We went to the same high school?\nMAC: Uh, yeah. We ran over that fisherman and promised to take the secret to our graves.\nLOGAN: I remember the fisherman.\nMAC: Remember? You bet your friends you could turn me into a super hot prom date as a joke, but you ended up falling in love with me?\nLogan thinks hard for a beat and takes a deep breath as if to say he does.\nLOGAN: Nope. Lost it.\nPARKER: Please stop.\nLogan grins. Veronica, a smile fixed on her face, can take no more of the banter. She gets up from the table.\nVERONICA: Ohh. Gotta split. Sorry. Late.\nPARKER: Hey, my birthday party. You can come, right?\nVeronica takes a deep breath.\nVERONICA: You know me. If there's a birthday party, I'm wearing a pointy hat. She laughs, a laugh that disappears the moment she turns away from them. Logan and Parker sit down at the table. Mac hurries to catch up with Veronica as they take their trays to the rubbish bin.\nVERONICA: You and Logan seem chummy.\nMAC: Guess I never thought much of the guy when you two were dating. Surly thing, you know. But since he's been around so much lately, I've seen his sweet side. Probably the side you saw all the time.\nVERONICA: Oh, yeah. That side.\nHaving dumped their trays, they head out of the Food Court.\nVERONICA: So, about Parker's party. If I must go...\nMAC: You must, you must.\nINT - HEARST COLLEGE, HALLWAY - CONTINUING.\nVeronica throws her arm around Mac's shoulder. After a moment's hesitation, Mac does the same.\nVERONICA: What do you say I swing by your place early, and you hit me on the head with a hammer a couple times before we go.\nMAC: Not that I wouldn't love to finally cross that off my to-do list, I promised Parker and Logan that I'd help them set up. Wanna come?\nVERONICA: Raincheck. I'll find reinforcements elsewhere.\nEnd music: \"Trina\" by Public Bulletin.\nINT - HEARST COLLEGE, BENES HALL - DAY.\nWallace and Piz are making their way towards their room.\nPIZ: It's like the new Rocky Horror. Now at one point people throw plastic spoons at the screen. You gotta check it out. It'll-it'll change your life. Wallace, hardly enthused, tosses the football he is holding at him. Unbeknownst to either, Veronica is coming up fast behind them. She races to fall between them. She grabs both their crooked arms, although Wallace lets his arm straighten and Veronica's hand slips off. Piz keeps his arm bent and Veronica doesn't let go.\nWALLACE: Uh-oh.\nVERONICA: Relax! I'm here to invite you to a party. Saturday night, rocking good time.\nWALLACE: The catch?\nVERONICA: No catch.\nThey reach the door to their dorm room and Piz and Wallace walk forward, pausing there and facing Veronica.\nVERONICA: I just...need a couple wingmen. It's Parker's birthday party. There's strength in numbers. You soldiers up for mission: moral support?\nWALLACE: Okay, cool. I'm in. But I think Piz has to go to-\nPIZ: No. Piz is in. It...it sounds like fun. I mean, I...maybe we could go pre-gaming before and you could by the room and we could...\nAs Wallace looks on Piz sadly, Veronica isn't listening. She's spotted a guy in a \"Sneed Batmen\" sweatshirt who passes them.\nVERONICA: Cool. Okay, uh...sorry, gotta boogie. She races off to follow the guy. Piz looks confused. He watches her go for a moment before opening the door into their room.\nWALLACE: I thought you were going to Yoyo Taco on Saturday. He follows Piz into the room.\nINT - HEARST COLLEGE, BENES HALL, WALLACE AND PIZ'S DORM ROOM - CONTINUING.\nPIZ: Yo La Tengo. Yeah. But, you know, this sounds more fun.\nWallace, having slammed the door shut, shakes his head and sinks down onto the small red couch.\nPIZ: What?\nWALLACE: You're like one of those guys who stands behind the players at the poker table and pretends he's playing.\nPIZ: Sorry, I've never been to Vegas, so what exactly...\nWALLACE: Look. Every once in a while, you gotta go all in.\nPIZ: Right. Will do.\nWALLACE: Excellent.\nPIZ: I don't know what that means, though.\nWALLACE: It means we're going out tonight. You're going to talk to some girl who knows you're alive. Wait, actually, that's not what it means, but it's a start.\nPiz gives a bemused snort.\nINT - HEARST COLLEGE, BENES HALL - DAY.\nVeronica catches up with the guy in the \"Sneed Batmen\" sweatshirt.\nVERONICA: Sorry to bother you. \"Sneed Batmen,\" what is that?\nSNEED BATMEN GUY: Sneed Hall. It's the chemistry building. The Batmen are the intramural softball team.\nThey reach the door to his room. Veronica leans against the wall and puts on her dumb girl act.\nVERONICA: Oh. Um...this is...embarrassing but I sort of flirted with number eleven the other day in the library. You wouldn't happen to know his name?\nSNEED BATMEN GUY: Sure. Jason Cohen.\nThe guy goes into his room and Veronica pushes herself off the wall.\nEXT - ZETA EPSILON FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT.\nThe Saturn pulls to a stop.\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: I found out Jason Cohen lives at the Zeta Epsilon house. A Jewish fraternity. Curious. Veronica looks over at the house. There's a large tree next to it and Veronica sees the flash of a camera from the upper branches, level with the first floor (second floor for Yanks) of the house.\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: What the hell? Veronica grabs her own camera and trains it on the tree, using the lens to get a better look. A sudden scream at another flash and the addition of more light from the room he is stalking, startles the man in the tree. He scampers down, grabs his bicycle, and pedals furiously away from the scene.\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: Okay. Peeping Tom in a tree takes off on a bike. I feel like I stumbled into a Benny Hill sketch. Veronica, still watching through the camera lens, hears the door of the house open. She swings the camera around to see Jason, his shirt off revealing a fetching vest, standing at the door, searching for the stalker. A hand appears on his shoulder and a girl comes into view. It's Amira. Veronica gets out of the car and walks towards them.\nVERONICA: Uh, Amira. You mind telling me what's going on here.\nAMIRA: Better question. Why the hell are you here?\nVERONICA: I'm here because I have surveillance footage of Jason skulking around your parents' restaurant last night after closing.\nAMIRA: He wasn't skulking. Jason's my boyfriend.\nAmira looks heavenward.\nAMIRA: Oh, I'm gonna kill Nasir.\nVERONICA: Who?\nAMIRA: Nasir? He works at the restaurant. His student visa expired and my parents agreed to give him a job.\nShe sighs and folds her arms.\nAMIRA: I was supposed to marry the guy. Jason looks down at her in surprise.\nJASON: Really.\nAMIRA: Don't ask. Those pictures will literally kill my dad.\nVERONICA: Are they X-rated?\nAMIRA: It's not the nudity. It's my co-star, the Jew.\nJason gives Veronica a lop-sided grin.\nAMIRA: However long it takes to get those photos developed and pedal over to my dad's house, that's how long I will be until I'm disowned.\nVERONICA: There's only two one-hour photo places open this late. And Nasir's on a bike. I'll see what I can do.\nAmira and Jason look relieved. Veronica spins around and heads back to her car.\nINT - CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT.\nVeronica enters the store, more like a supermarket. She spots Nasir who is in Arab dress as he waits by the magazine rack, flicking through one of the magazines. He doesn't notice her. Veronica goes to the one-hour photo counter. A guy is busy at the machine. Veronica clears her throat to get his attention. He turns to face her, wearing a slight manic grin.\nVERONICA: Hi, um, my boyfriend... She looks over her shoulder deliberately at Nasir.\nVERONICA: ...is a tad embarrassed to pick up the photos we just dropped off. There are a few special-moments-with-special-friends type shots. Men! It's all rah-rah-rah until you find yourself in an all night phot-mat. The rubbery-faced clerk's visage turns increasingly tragic.\nVERONICA: Um, how much do we owe you? The clerk peers out at Nasir, not quite believing the relationship.\nONE-HOUR PHOTO CLERK: That's your boyfriend?\nVERONICA: Yeah. It's like I'm dating a young Omar Sharif. Desert fever, what are you going to do. Um, are they ready?\nONE-HOUR PHOTO CLERK: Uh,um, I'm on the last one. I've had some problems with the machine jamming.\nVERONICA: Okay.\nThe clerk checks the machine and then watches Veronica as she walks over to Nasir. Veronica stops right in front of him.\nVERONICA: Sorry. Do you have the time. Nasir looks down at her with disapproving disdain.\nNASIR: 11:15.\nVeronica pauses a moment, smiling, then runs her hand down Nasir's arm, ending with a pat.\nVERONICA: [softly] Thank you. Nasir is a little disgusted, but doesn't react as Veronica walks away from him, back to the counter. The clerk, who has been watching, shakes his head at the interesting pairings life throws up. Veronica reaches the counter, getting out some cash which she places on the counter.\nVERONICA: Arab men. So macho. With a chuckle, she grabs the photos from the counter and heads towards the exit, calling out to Nasir as she goes.\nVERONICA: Nasir! Startled, he looks up and responds to a little wave from her.\nVERONICA: See you back at the apartment. Don't be late! Veronica blows him a kiss and leaves. Nasir stares after her, his hand still held up in the wave. He drops his hand and walks over to the counter. The clerk watches him with increasing consternation.\nNASIR: My photos. Are they done?\nONE-HOUR PHOTO CLERK: Your girlfriend just picked them up.\nNASIR: Girlfriend? I don't know that woman. [with increasing aggression] You gave her my pictures?\nONE-HOUR PHOTO CLERK: Sir! Count to ten, please. I am not the enemy.\nNasir makes to run after Veronica.\nONE-HOUR PHOTO CLERK: I still have a few of the prints that were only half developed when the machine jammed. Nasir swings between to racing after Veronica or staying for photos.\nINT - THE BREAK - NIGHT.\nMusic: \"Hold On to You\" by the Waking Hours. Wallace and Piz are sitting at the bar, drinking beer and watching a girl play billiards. The guy playing with her hands her cash as she wins the game. Wallace starts to search his own pockets.\nWALLACE: Hey, it's worth losing twenty bucks just to talk to her.\nPIZ: We came here for me, remember?\nWALLACE: Yeah, that was before I saw her.\nPiz plants a firm hand on Wallace's shoulder, forcing him down on the stool.\nPIZ: Oh, no you don't. No. Piz gets up off his stool to head for the girl, pointing at Wallace on route.\nPIZ: Judas. Piz arrives at the billiards table and slaps notes on it with a flourish.\nPIZ: I got twenty bucks that says you can whip my ass and make me like it.\nMIRANDA: Well, I do like a confident man.\nShe reaches down close to Piz's groin to grab the triangle for setting up the balls, although it takes Piz a split-second to realise that. Wallace laughs from his observation post at the bar. End music: \"Hold On to You\" by the Waking Hours.\nINT - HEARST COLLEGE, AMIRA'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT.\nLike all the rooms, Amira's has a whiteboard on the door on which someone has written \"I can't wait till its all over - summer time - beaches.\" She opens the door to Veronica. She smiles on seeing her. Veronica holds up the pictures.\nVERONICA: Look what I found. Amira is delighted them, taking them with an excited sigh of relief.\nAMIRA: Thank you, Veronica! Ooh. She beckons Veronica into the room with a soundless \"Come in\" and a wave, then looks through the snaps.\nAMIRA: Ooh.\nVERONICA: I must say, your spurned suiter? He may be crazy, but...\nVeronica waves the heat from her face.\nVERONICA: Oh, my.\nAMIRA: If I didn't mind being treated as property, he might be tempting.\nThere's a firm knock at the door. A little surprised, Amira opens it.\nRASHAD: [furious] Explain this! He's holding out a half-developed picture of Amira and Jason.\nRASHAD: Now! Amira is still standing, frozen. Veronica, behind her, also stays silent.\nRASHAD: Nasir says that this boy lives in a Jewish fraternity. Is he a Jew? Amira drops her eyes and says nothing.\nRASHAD: Being with this boy is what has caused of all this. The threats, the vandalism. The community has obviously found out and turned against us!\nVERONICA: When you say \"community,\" do you mean Jewish or Arab?\nRASHAD: Either. Both. I don't know.\nRashad points at Veronica.\nRASHAD: The restaurant is no longer your concern. You're fired. Leave! Veronica walks towards the door.\nVERONICA: I work for your wife. If she wants me fired, she can give me a call. Veronica walks away from them, Rashad not happy that she's being defiant.\nINT - THE BREAK - NIGHT.\nMr. Murphy is in his office in the back, sitting at his desk counting out bills. Keith arrives.\nKEITH: Mr. Murphy. One of my deputies told me you wanted a private audience. I was in the neighbourhood.\nMURPHY: You know why people enjoy going to bars, Sheriff?\nKeith stares down at him impassively.\nMURPHY: They can drink at home. People want to relax. Let their hair down. That's not easy to do when every ten minutes uniformed deputies are showing up and harassing them. The funny thing is I always backed the badge. In fact I usually buy an especially large amount of sheriff's department raffle tickets every year. Sheriff Lamb, God rest his soul, really appreciated his relationship with local businesses. Murphy gets up from the desk and walks around to the front of it to join Keith.\nMURPHY: So how many raffle tickets do you think The Break should buy this year, Sheriff? You know, just to, uh, make sure that we keep working together. Ten bucks a pop? Maybe five hundred tickets?\nKEITH: We won't be having a raffle this year, Mr. Murphy. The hospital is having a pancake breakfast. Perhaps you could better serve the community by giving to them.\nMurphy follows Keith out of the office.\nMURPHY: You sure you're thinking this all the way through, Sheriff? Keith pauses at some photographs on the wall. One picture gets his attention. It's a picture of the 2006 baseball or softball team, Excessive Force. The team appears to be made up of deputies, as Sacks and Gills are among the players.\nMURPHY: Your boys really enjoy those new uniforms every year, tournament fees taken care of, post-game pitchers of beer on the house. It's like I'm one of the team. Keith looks from the photo to Murphy, but before he can respond, his attention is diverted by the sound of a girl's laugh. He looks up to see the girl with Wallace. He heads for them. Piz sees him coming and urgently slaps Wallace, who is finishing the remains of his bottle of beer.\nKEITH: Wallace? Wallace is still laughing with the girl. Piz is trying to hide unnoticed behind him.\nWALLACE: Ah, man! Wallace finally looks over and the laughter dies in his throat.\nWALLACE: Mr. Mars.\nKEITH: Last time I saw you, you were nineteen, and that was...just a couple weeks ago.\nMURPHY: I ID'd these boys myself. You can check it. If they're not legit, I'll shut this place down right now.\nKeith is clearly sceptical.\nKEITH: Wallace. Stosh. Piz gives him a nervous grin.\nKEITH: Mind if I see those IDs of yours. They get them out and hand them over sheepishly. Keith examines them and immediately recognises the work.\nKEITH: I guess I don't have to ask where you got these.\nINT - MARS RESIDENCE - DAY.\nHalf-awake, Veronica walks from her bedroom to the kitchen. She wakes up fast when she sees Piz and Wallace's fake IDs taped to the refrigerator.\nKEITH: You recognise the work? Keith appears behind her from his bedroom. Veronica looks at him and sighs.\nKEITH: Out of thirty-seven citations yours truly wrote in six campus-area bars last night, no fake ID could hold a candle to your standards. You may not want to believe this, honey, but there are mistakes you can't take back. What if they'd gotten drunk and stumbled into the street like Jim Wilson. Would you want to explain that to their parents? Veronica doesn't say anything, but sighs again as Keith leaves the apartment. Her cell phone rings..\nVERONICA: Hello?\nEXT - BABYLON GARDENS - CONTINUING.\nSabirah is distraught. Nasir is behind her, cleaning \"Terrorists Go Home\" off the window.\nSABIRAH: It's happened again.\nINT - MARS RESIDENCE - CONTINUING.\nVERONICA: I'll check the camera. I'll be right over.\nINT - BABYLON GARDENS - DAY.\nA picture of a young man spray painting the window is held out and passed to Sabirah. She looks at it closely, then shrugs.\nSABIRAH: I've never seen this man. Veronica takes the picture back.\nVERONICA: No problem. I can track him. I just wanted to see if you knew who he was first.\nEXT - BABYLON GARDENS - DAY.\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: Fortunately, the vandal took the bait.\nVeronica exits. Nasir, still cleaning, stops to stare at her. She sees him and smiles. Nasir glares at her.\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: One Arabic scroll with a tracer stitched inside.\nEXT - NEPTUNE STREETS - DAY.\nVeronica follows the sound of the tracer until she is led to the scroll which is in a trash can. She looks around. She's in one of the poorer parts of Neptuen and notes the house nearby. As she ponders, a Ford van pulls up. The driver leans out. It's the same guy as in the picture.\nDERRICK: Can I help you find something? Veronica smiles. She reaches into her bag as she walks towards him.\nVERONICA: Look what I've got. She pulls out the envelope with the picture in it.\nVERONICA: It's a surveillance photo from Babylon Gardens. Shows you painting \"Terrorist\" on their building. By now Derrick, wearing a patriotic T-shirt, is out of the van.\nDERRICK: Well, you ain't a cop. So my response is gonna have to be \"So the hell what?\"\nVERONICA: Why'd you do it?\nDERRICK: If you have to ask that then you ain't been paying attention.\nVERONICA: That's it? You're just another closed-minded redneck who thinks it's his patriotic duty to harass innocent people?\nDERRICK: Not quite.\nHe walks away from her to the back of the van. Veronica follows.\nVERONICA: I know where you live now. In about five minutes, I'll know your name. The family you're harassing is gonna press charges.\nDERRICK'S BROTHER: [offscreen] Derrick, what have you done now?\nVeronica rounds the back of the van to the other side. She sees Derrick's wheel-chair bound older brother on the lift letting him down from the van.\nDERRICK: This girl here wants to know why I spray painted \"terrorist\" on that towel-head restaurant.\nDERRICK'S BROTHER: You really think Babylon Gardens is a terrorist front?\nDERRICK: As a matter of fact, I do.\nDerrick walks quickly past his brother to the front of the van.\nDERRICK'S BROTHER: Sorry about my little brother. He's been pretty worked up since I came home like this. Veronica nods. Derrick, having grabbed a sheet of paper from the van, strides back to Veronica.\nDERRICK: One of the dudes who works there. Passing these out by the mall. It's a black and white cartoon. Over the shape of the country of Iraq is the name in block capitals. One American soldier stands in front of the I with his gun raised. A second enters the I, as if it were the start of an enclosed conveyer belt. A man in Arabic dress, with his face covered, stands behind the A and Q, going \"Hee Hee!\" From the Q, a coffin draped with the American flag exits the word to join another coffin already expelled.\nDERRICK: I followed him back to the restaurant on his bike. Iraqis laughing at dead Americans? If that ain't terrorist propaganda, then I don't know what it. Derrick, firmly unapologetic, heads back to his brother.\nINT - BABYLON GARDENS - DAY.\nThe restaurant is quite busy as Veronica enters.\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: Generally the satisfaction of nailing someone for a crime like this is its own reward. So where's the sugar rush of sweet justice I should be feeling right now? Veronica joins Rashad and Sabirah at one of the tables.\nSABIRAH: Hello.\nRASHAD: Hi.\nThey lean forward to hear her report.\nVERONICA: So, his name is Derrick Karr. He admitted to vandalising your restaurant after he was handed this. She pulls the cartoon out of her bag and holds it up to them. Sabirah takes it and they both stare down at it.\nVERONICA: By Nasir. He was distributing them outside the mall. Derrick followed him back here. Rashad and Sabirah exchange a sad glance.\nVERONICA: Derrick's brother was shot up in Iraq.\nRASHAD: His brother was a soldier?\nVERONICA: Yes. But he had no idea what Derrick had done.\nVeronica takes a deep breath.\nVERONICA: I did some checking. Derrick's on probation for stealing cars. If you press charges, it'll most likely mean some jail time for him.\nRASHAD: I want to meet this man.\nINT - HEARST COLLEGE, BENES HALL - DAY.\nKeith walks down the corridor, attracting furtive glances from passing students. He arrives at the door to Wallace and Piz's room. He pauses to consider the front of the latest Lampoon cover. Entitled \"Mars Attacks!\" it depicts Wallace and Piz being caught by a finger-waving Keith at The Break, with Keith's head being twice the size of his body. Keith knocks on the door. Piz opens it. Wallace is behind him, playing with a mini-basketball.\nPIZ: Uh, Mr., uh, Sheriff Mars!\nKEITH: Hello, Stosh. What do you say we head out. Have a few beers.\nPiz stares at him in shock for a moment before smiling and pointing at him.\nPIZ: It's one of those trick questions, isn't it?\nKEITH: I've got some new IDs for you.\nHe holds up a couple of cards.\nKEITH: Wallace! Wallace joins Piz at the door and they take the proffered IDs. They take a moment to look at them.\nPIZ: This picture is Jon Bon Jovi.\nKEITH: Yes. It is.\nWALLACE: Biggie Smalls? We don't really all look alike, Mr. Mars.\nKEITH: I know that, Wallace. Now, let's go out and get our drink on.\nINT - THE BREAK - NIGHT.\nMusic: \"The Hard Light\" by Mere Mortals.\nLYRICS: I'm on a wire I'm on a star I got a feeling you don't know where you are Here she comes now She got the word She wrote the note that you never heard Come on We're all done Who's in your head, who's in my song?\nBeer fills a glass from a pitcher. Wallace slides the glass along the bar to Piz who picks it up unenthusiastically.\nPIZ: Non-alcoholic beer. All the peeing, none of the fun.\nWALLACE: Quit complaining. One night of this and we're off the hook.\nPIZ: Plus, if things work out with Miranda, this could be one of those cool first-time-we-met stories.\nWALLACE: What about it is cool? And by the way, you invited her to join us at Logan's party. Your lack of pimp juice is going to cost you, son.\nFurther discourse is forestalled by the arrival of Deputy Gills.\nGILLS: All right. Let's have all you finest minds of So. Cal. put your IDs in the air...\nGIRL: Oh, come on.\nGILLS: And wave them around like you just don't care.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe bar's customers do as told and hold up their IDs. Gills walks along the length of the bar, barely looking at them. He gets to Wallace and Piz. Piz's card gives him a moment's pause. He looks at Wallace's and then back at Piz's, metaphorically rolling his eyes.\nGILLS: Thank you. And goodnight. This waste of time has been brought to you by the temporary sheriff of Balboa County. Gills leaves the bar. Wallace picks up the walkie-talkie on his lap.\nWALLACE: Did you get that, Mr. Mars?\nEnd music: \"The Hard Light\" by Mere Mortals.\nEXT - THE BREAK - CONTINUING.\nKeith is parked outside.\nKEITH: Got it. He switches off the walkie-talkie and watches Deputy Gills as he walks away from the bar.\nINT - SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY.\nKeith has the deputies gathered together again.\nKEITH: Last night, I ordered another sweep of the bars. Smith, Jones, Taylor, Gills. Clean out your lockers, you're fired.\nGILLS: You're firing us? You're the substitute teacher. We were hired by Don Lamb. I know these guys better than you do, Keith. You try to pull this stunt, we all walk.\nKEITH: Fair enough.\nKeith points.\nKEITH: There's the door. Sacks and the other deputies don't make a move.\nGILLS: You don't have the stones--\nKEITH: Leave your badge on the desk and get the hell out of my station.\nGills opens his mouth to argue, but as he looks around he can see that he doesn't have the support he thought he had. He takes off his badge and walks towards the desk on the way out.\nEXT - KARR RESIDENCE - DAY.\nDerrick opens the door.\nDERRICK: You. He's not pleased to see Veronica.\nVERONICA: I've got some people who want to meet you. She indicated the Krimanis, standing behind her.\nVERONICA: Rashad, Sabirah Krimani. This is Derrick Karr. They own Babylon Gardens.\nRASHAD: I wanted to meet you. Talk to you.\nDERRICK: Lucky me.\nDerrick starts to shut the door in their faces.\nVERONICA: Hey, if they report you, it's off to jail you go.\nDERRICK: So, I end up in jail. My brother ends up in a wheelchair and these foreigners are free to spit on America and everything it stands for.\nRASHAD: What it stands for? Do you even know what it stands for?\nDerrick prepares for a lecture with ill grace.\nRASHAD: Saying you love America is easy. It's easy until someone spray paints \"terrorist\" on your door. It's easy until you are handed a flyer that mocks the sacrifice of your brother. We all came from somewhere else. We all are trying to make it. In America, whatever you stand for you're supposed to get a fair shot. That is what your brother was fighting for. In case you wanted to know. Derrick glares at him, unmoved.\nDERRICK: So turn me in, Ali Baba. It makes no difference to me. Derrick slams the door shut. Veronica sighs heavily. She gets out her phone.\nVERONICA: He'll be in jail in an hour. Veronica starts to dial.\nRASHAD: No, no. Don't, don't turn him in. I suspect that our troubles with Mr. Karr are over. I'm glad that I had the chance to speak with the man.\nVERONICA: You sure?\nRashad nods.\nVERONICA: Okay. Veronica leads them away from the door. Sabirah puts her arm around her husband.\nSABIRAH: I'm so proud of you. Your words were so inspirational. I was wondering. Do they apply to your daughter as well? Rashad sighs.\nRASHAD: I guess I should meet the boy.\nSABIRAH: And what do we do about Nasir?\nRASHAD: Well, he didn't break any laws handing out the flyer and I support his right to exercise free speech. But that doesn't mean that I have to support him or shelter him. That cartoon pissed me off. It was un-American.\nINT - BABYLON GARDENS - DAY.\nNasir is working in the kitchen.\nINS AGENT: Nasir Ben Hafayid. Nasir looks up to see two men in suits enter the kitchen. The first man holds up his badge.\nINS AGENT: You're in this country on an expired I-20 student visa. The agent cuffs Nasir.\nINS AGENT: In accordance with INS 214 any statement you make can be used in a court of law, immigration or administrative proceeding. Nasir is led away.\nINT - MARS RESIDENCE - NIGHT.\nKeith is pouring the contents of a large saucepan into a colander. Veronica arrives.\nKEITH: Hey, honey. Just in time. Hungry?\nVERONICA: Nope, but the food's free.\nVeronica gets plates from the cupboard.\nKEITH: Wallace called. He and Piz are going to meet you at the party. Said you'd understand.\nVERONICA: [horrified] They're ditching me?\nKEITH: I warned them you wouldn't understand. Score one for Dad. By the way, you didn't tell me I made the front page of the Lampoon.\nHaving laid the plates, Veronica sinks onto the stool.\nKEITH: This had to have been tough on you the last couple of days, having your old man back as sheriff.\nVERONICA: Actually, it's been tough on me knowing I let you down. I'm sorry about those IDs. I vow to use the Mars powers for good rather than evil from now on.\nKEITH: There's never a stenographer around when you need one.\nVeronica wrinkles her brow at her father.\nINT - NEPTUNE GRAND HOTEL - NIGHT.\nVeronica boards one of the lifts/elevators.\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: Things I'd rather do than attend this party solo. Seven minutes of heaven with Scott Peterson...\nDICK: Hold the door!\nVERONICA VOICEOVER: Ride the space elevator with Dick...\nDick catches the door before it shuts and gets into the lift.\nDICK: Always the lady. You came. Good for you. Thought something like this would be unbelievably awkward.\nVERONICA: Your fly's open.\nDICK: I know. Party ritual.\nVeronica frowns and looks over at him. He's got a hip flask and takes a long swig. Veronica holds out her hand for it. Surprised, he gives it to her. She looks at the open flask for a moment, her need for Dutch courage battling the idea of taking a drink from Dick. Dutch courage wins but not before she wipes the mouth of the flask on her dress.\nDICK: Veronica Mars! What's that line about the beginning of some sort of friendship? Veronica throws back her head for a long drink.\nINT - NEPTUNE GRAND HOTEL, LOGAN'S SUITE - NIGHT.\nMusic: \"The Time of Times\" by Badly Drawn Boy.\nLYRICS: Oh, sweet morning Is your head not right Did you hear my warning This is the time of times And your head feels like your body Your mind is close behind There's a teardrop on your shoulder That says this is the time of times It's the time of times again This is the time of times It's the time of times again Oh, sweet morning And your head's not right Did you hear my warning This is the time of times\nMac looks around the party, a worried look on her face. She sees Veronica and Dick enter the suite.\nDICK: Later. Dick passes Veronica to head into the party. Mac heads for Veronica.\nVERONICA: Why are you looking at me like that?\nMAC: Sorry. I was afraid you were trying to get back at Logan somehow by coming as Dick's date.\nVERONICA: Ew. Yeah, nothing says \"I'm over you\" like dating down.\nVeronica looks around. She gasps.\nVERONICA: Couch opening! She grabs Mac's hand and they run to the empty couch on which they collapse with relief.\nVERONICA: Okay. This couch is our social foxhole for the next sixty minutes of battle. Defend it at all costs. Veronica spots Wallace and Piz. Coming towards them too is Max.\nMAX: Hey, Veronica. Veronica smiles and then peers around his body to see Wallace and Piz.\nMAX: And friend.\nVERONICA: Sorry, right, uh, Max, this is my friend, Mac. Mac, Max.\nVeronica jumps up from her seat.\nVERONICA: Where are my manners? Sit, defend, decide which one of you's changing their name. I'll be right back. Veronica races to Wallace and Piz.\nWALLACE: Hey, you made it.\nPIZ: Hey.\nVERONICA: Hey, bozos. We had plans!\nOver on the couch, Max is now sitting on the couch next to Mac and the two of them are smiling shyly.\nWALLACE: Your dad didn't give you the message?\nVERONICA: You were supposed to be my wing men. What mission could be more important than that?\nMiranda arrives, holding out drinks for both Piz and Wallace.\nMIRANDA: Here you go, boys. Miranda arrives, holding out drinks for both Piz and Wallace.\nVERONICA: [quietly] I see. Battle of the bulge.\nWALLACE: Veronica Mars. Miranda Apfel.\nMIRANDA: Hey.\nVERONICA: Hi.\nElsewhere in the room, Dick is talking to the first of his hot MySpace invitees, a girl called Lisa.\nLISA: I loved the quote you have up on your MySpace page. What was it again?\nDICK: \"The Dude abides.\" I don't know about you but I take comfort in that.\nLisa giggles.\nLISA: What else do you take comfort in? Before he has to think of an answer, he sees the second MySpace girl has arrived.\nDICK: Drinks. Be right back. He leaves her and heads for the other girl. Logan starts tapping on a glass, bringing the room to order.\nLOGAN: Can I, uh, get everyone's attention for one minute. Parker advances to the centre of the room. Veronica turns to watch.\nLOGAN: Now I had this whole \"My Super Sweet Nineteen\" thing planned for tonight, but, uh, it turns out the hotel has a policy on Bengal tiger rides. He and Parker grin at each other.\nLOGAN: There is one ludicrous thing I was able to pull off that helps makes up for it. One of the hotel room service waiters arrives, pushing a trolley on which is a large box from a bakery. Everyone in the room, except Veronica, claps and whistles.\nPARKER: You remembered! Oh, my God. Logan moves around to join her in front of the box. The lid is lifted to reveal a large cake. One side of it is taken up with the message \"Happy birthday Parker.\" The other features a photo of the two of them in icing. Also on the table are a couple of gifts on one of which burns two candles. Parker laughs in delight and puts her hand affectionately on Logan's face. Veronica watches. End music: \"The Time of Times\" by Badly Drawn Boy. Music: \"And I Was a Boy from School\" by Hot Chip.\nLYRICS: And I was a boy from school Helplessly helping all the rules And there was a boy at school Hopelessly wrestling all his fools And then there was a girl at school Blaming all the words she learned from home Nothing could keep her a child Long hours don't you know we try We try but we didn't have long We try but we don't belong We try but we didn't have long We try but we don't belong Now I meet you on the street Harmlessly breaking rules, we meet Lives are found and loves are lost Say goodbye to nothing everything caused Now I find you on my street Breaking rules hopelessly we meet Lives are found but loves are lost\nElsewhere, Dick is working on hot MySpace girl #2.\nDICK: You're kidding!\nHOT MYSPACE GIRL #2: My dad does half the team's taxes. We should go to a game sometime.\nShe takes a step closer towards him.\nHOT MYSPACE GIRL #2: You can spend halftime in my private box.\nDICK: Awesome! Would you give me a few minutes? I have some party responsibilities to attend to.\nDick starts to move away, unaware that Lisa has just joined Hot MySpace Girl #2.\nLISA: Hey there. Dick turns to see his two dates standing side by side. He is a little stunned.\nLISA: Isn't he yummy?\nHOT MYSPACE GIRL #2: I know. You just want to...eat him up.\nDick looks from one to the other and lets out a bemused chuckle. Back at the trolley, Parker is serving cake. Veronica approaches. Parker gazes at her and lets out a deep breath.\nPARKER: Thank you.\nVERONICA: Me? You're the one dishing out cake.\nPARKER: I was worried...that things were going to be weird and you're just...a class act.\nVERONICA: I'm happy for you guys. I've never seen him...on a cake like this.\nParker giggles.\nVERONICA: Feel free to just hack in anywhere.\nPARKER: Okay.\nParker hands her a plate with a piece of cake on it. Veronica moves away before she notices that she's unfortunately got the piece with Logan's face. She looks up at the sound of Max's laughter.\nMAX: [offscreen] That's brilliant! Veronica watches them as she eats her cake. Mac giggles.\nMAX: An online purity test. So basically you got people to detail their s*x lives.\nMAC: And be scored accordingly, then I sold their sexual secrets to their peers for ten bucks a pop.\nMAX: I like how you think.\nMAC: Veronica busted me, but kept quiet. We've been friends ever since.\nAs Veronica watches Max and Mac getting on so well, Logan comes up from behind to stand next to her.\nLOGAN: Checking out the talent? He laughs and takes a sip of his drink.\nVERONICA: How is it you have so many friends? You don't even like people.\nLOGAN: And yet they adore me.\nThey start walking the room together.\nLOGAN: I girded myself for seeing with a date tonight, you know, proof you weren't pining away.\nVERONICA: All the periodically good ones were taken and I pine for no man.\nVeronica puts down the now empty plate.\nLOGAN: Hmm. Well maybe you should try branching out. I mean, who knows, maybe there's a consistently good one here tonight. On the couch, Max and Mac continue to get on like a house on fire.\nMAC: So you sell tests, sorry, study guides.\nMAX: Yeah, it's not easy. Undergrad courses change quarter to quarter, visiting professors switch up curriculums, RTAs to bribe. It's exhausting.\nMAC: Tell me you're a business major.\nMAX: Philosophy. No lie. I think therefore I am.\nThey laugh.\nMAX: Okay. Seriously, did...did my friends hire you. Mac stares at him quizzically. Elsewhere Veronica is approached by an unwelcome guest.\nROCK-A-BILLY LOSER: Hey, the host says you're a big-time swing dancer. Veronica glances over at Logan, who is watching and smirking. He holds up his drink in salute. Veronica laughs uncomfortably. Logan's loving it until his attention is pulled away by an excited Dick.\nDICK: Dude, you're not going to believe this. Hottie internet chicks found out about each other, talked it over, and they're into it.\nLOGAN: Into it?\nDICK: Doublemint, baby!\nLOGAN: Are they becoming twins?\nDICK: What?

Concentrating on filling the ice bucket, he doesn't hear the high heeled shoe slide a stopper under the door, jamming it closed, until it's done.

I-I've heard your show. Wallace shakes his head at Piz's lack of interest as Miranda sidles close up to Piz.\nMIRANDA: Maybe you could dedicate something to me?\nPIZ: Absolutely, even though it's a talk show. I could dedicate a segment on campus neighbourhood zones for you.\nThey are interrupted by the sudden arrival of Veronica who flies into Piz's arms.\nVERONICA: There you are! She gives him a big hug and whispers in his ear.\nVERONICA: Sorry, this is a break glass in case of emergency situation. I need you to pretend to be my boyfriend. Piz keeps a hold of her while he considers this. Wallace watches with some concern. Piz and Veronica break.\nPIZ: Oh, sorry. You're right, babe. Bad boyfriend. Fresh drink coming up, okay.

And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.\nRachel: I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...\nMonica: Ok, so you've done some good work! (pause) What about your carry-ons?\nRachel: Oh, well. Everything that I need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.\nMonica: Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you! (they hug)\nChandler: Where's your passport?\nRachel: It should be right next to my plane ticket.\nChandler: Well, it's not.\nRachel: What?

Why isn't she staying with you guys?\nMonica: Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.\nErica: Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!\nRoss: Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...\nMonica: Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.\nErica (standing up): I'll be right back.\nRoss: Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.\nMonica: Oh, I know. I know.

This is packing?\nChandler: We're taking a break!\nMonica: From?\nChandler: Jumping on the bed?\nMonica: All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!\nRoss: You got it! (Monica leaves, Ross closes the door). All right, she's right, we gotta get serious.

Maybe Richard!\nChandler: Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky!

Where's Mike?\nPhoebe: Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.\nRoss: Yeah? Yeah, where is it?\nPhoebe: Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.\nRoss: Rock on!\nPhoebe (watching the food on the table): Wow, this is quite a spread! (pause) What is all this stuff?\nMonica: Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.\nJoey: (entering the room) Hey.\nChandler: Hey.\nRoss: Hey, where's Rach?\nJoey: Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.\nRoss: Great.\nJoey: Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?\nMonica: Yeah.\n(Rachel enters the room)\nEverybody: Hey Rach, hey you.\nRoss: Here she is!\nRachel (crying): Hi you guys!\nJoey: What did I just say?\nRachel: No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.\nMonica: Come here, I'll make you a drink.\nRoss: Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?\nChandler: I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. (Ross and Joey looks puzzled) I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!\nJoey (to Ross): You know, I had a chance to stop her too!\nRoss: Yeah?\nJoey: Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row?

You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!\nRachel: I'm gonna miss you so much.\nPhoebe: I know.\nRachel: You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here (they go into the guest room).\nRoss: Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?\nJoey: Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.\n[Scene: Guest room. Rachel and Phoebe are sitting on the bed.]\nRachel: Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.\nPhoebe: Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, (she takes something out from her pocket) but I do have something for you.\nRachel: Oh, oh. (she's holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it). What is this?\nPhoebe: It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!\nRachel: I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!\n[Scene: Monica's apartment. The living room.]\nMonica: Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.\nChandler: Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!\nMonica: What are you talking about? These aren't mine.\nChandler: Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!\nMonica: That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.\nChandler: Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?\nMonica: Rachel used to live in that room.\nChandler: Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! (he looks excited)\nMonica: Joey's bare ass!\nChandler: (he doesn't look excited anymore). Well played.\n(Phoebe and Rachel enter the living room.)\nRachel: I love you Phoebe.\nPhoebe: I love you too. (they hug) Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!

Monica?\nMonica: Yeah?\nRachel: Can you come here with me for a minute?\nMonica: Sure.\nPhoebe: (to Monica) Are you wearing waterproof mascara?\nMonica: No.\nPhoebe: Oh, you're so screwed. (Monica goes into the guest room)\nRoss: (to Phoebe) Hey. What was that all about?\nPhoebe: She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.\nRoss: Are you kidding? Oh my God...\nPhoebe: Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.\nRoss: Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. (pause) Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.\n[Scene: The guest bedroom. Rachel and Monica are talking to each other.]\nRachel: Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...\nMonica: I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.\nRachel: (starts crying and speaking at the same time, making it almost impossible to understand what she's saying) I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...\nMonica: (having the same problem) You're the best friend I ever had.\nRachel: (says something that cannot be understood)\nMonica: What?\nRachel: I... I... I... (again saying something that cannot be understood)\nMonica: That is so sweet. (they hug)\n[Scene: Back to the living room. Monica and Rachel enter and hug each other. The guys see this.]\nRoss: (to Joey) Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.\nChandler: Uh, Rach?\nRoss: Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.\nJoey: I really made you think about that thing uh?\nChandler: (to Rachel) Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)\nRachel: (laughs) Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.\nChandler: No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.\nRachel: Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...\nChandler: Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?\nRachel: Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.\nChandler: Pheebs!\nPhoebe: (from the other side of the room) Yeah!\nChandler: I think these are yours.\nPhoebe: These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.\nRachel: (to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?\nChandler: Sure. (to Phoebe) You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?\nPhoebe: Where do you think Mike really is? (she giggles, Chandler looks aghast)\n[Scene: The guest bedroom. Chandler and Rachel.]\nRachel: Oh honey...\nChandler: Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.\nRachel: (all mushy) Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. (they hug)\nChandler: Ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.\nRachel: Okay. Oh...\n(Chandler blows raspberry again)\nRachel: Oh!\nChandler: I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: Monica's living room. We look outside to the balcony where Rachel is saying goodbye to Joey.]\nMonica: (to Ross) So, I guess you're next. You're ready?\nRoss: I don't think so.\nChandler: Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.\nMonica: You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.\nChandler: That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.\nRoss: God! I can't believe she saved me for last. (looking out to the balcony) Why are they taking so long?\nPhoebe: I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.\n(Rachel and Joey hug, and Rachel turns to enter the apartment through the side window again. At that moment Joey tries to climb over the edge of the balcony.)\nAll: No, no, no, no!\n(Rachel rushes back and pulls Joey back onto the balcony, and takes him inside.)\nRoss: Okay, here we go...\nRachel: Oh... (holding Ross's shoulder) Well...\nRoss: Yeah...\nRachel: I think I'm gonna take off. (pats Ross on his back, but he looks very surprised)\nRoss: Huh?\nRachel: Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.\n(She leaves the apartment and they all stare at Ross)\nRoss: What? I don't get a goodbye?\nJoey: (still very emotional) Lucky b*st*rd!\n[Scene: Monica's apartment continued... Phoebe, Chandler, Monica and Joey are sitting down and Ross is pacing up and down.]\nRoss: Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.\nMonica: Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.\nRoss: Well, it needs to be plicit.\nJoey: All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?\nRoss: No, I don't think so.\nPhoebe: You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.\nMonica: Yeah. Mine too.\nChandler: Mine was a humdinger\nRoss: (annoyed) O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? (Joey gives Ross a hug) NOT FROM YOU! (Joey lets go)\nPhoebe: Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.\nMonica: And say what? \"You owe me a goodbye\", I mean, he's got more pride than that.\nRoss: THE HELL I DO!\n(Ross takes big steps leaving for Joey and Rachel's apartment, where Rachel is going through her papers.)\nRoss: I don't get a goodbye?\nRachel: What?\nRoss: (talking agitated and angry) Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.\nRachel: Ross...\nRoss: Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises) IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. (He leaves the apartment. Rachel looks kind of desperate.)\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. The others are still there.]\nMonica: I hope Ross isn't too upset.\nJoey: I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.\nPhoebe: Tell me about it.\nChandler: Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.\nPhoebe: All right, I think I'm gonna head out.\nMonica: Uh, where do you think you're going?\nPhoebe: I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.\nMonica: We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.\nChandler: Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.\nJoey: Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. (he mimes hitting his head with his fist)\nMonica: Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.\nChandler: (to Joey) You couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)\nMonica: Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?\nPhoebe and Joey: Yeah.\nMonica: Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.\nChandler: Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.\nMonica: You did? How?\nChandler: Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.\nMonica: Oh my God! Let me see. (they all look at the pictures)\nJoey: Who's that dirty old lady?\nChandler: Monica's grandmother.\nMonica: Nana liked it rough!\n(Erica, the pregnant girl, enters)\nErica: Hi!\nAll: Hey!\nJoey: Come on here, have a seat.\nPhoebe: How was your night?\nErica: Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh... (she looks likes she is in pain, holding her belly) Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.\nMonica: Erica, are you okay?\nErica: Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.\nMonica: Oh my God!\nChandler: Relax! We just get her some antacids.\nMonica: She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.\nChandler: Oh my God!\nPhoebe: Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.\nMonica: All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh! (she's hyperventilating)\nChandler: Honey, it's gonna be okay.\nErica: You can do this. Just breathe.\nMonica: Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.\nErica: (in pain) Ooh! Are you sure?\nMonica: Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.\n(there's a lot of supportive cheers from all. Erica, Monica and Chandler leave.)\nJoey: Chandler, wait, wait, wait...\nChandler: What?\nJoey: If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.\n[Scene: Ross's apartment. Rachel bursts in.]\nRachel: You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?\nRoss: That's what it seemed like.\nRachel: I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.\nRoss: Fine, then why didn't you say something?\nRachel: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!\nRoss: Rach!\nRachel: What?\nRoss: You keep, you keep... You can't...\nRachel: WHAT?\n(Ross walks over to her and starts to kiss her passionately. After a while Rachel backs out. She thinks a while and starts kissing him back.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment.]\nJoey: A little more.\nPhoebe: Okay. (she starts to stuff styrofoam peanuts down the front of Joey's pants.)\nJoey: A little more, a little more. (she stuffs some more down his pants and Joey's assesses the how many there already are in there.) A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.\nPhoebe: All right, ready?\nJoey: Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.\nPhoebe: All right, here it goes...\n(she knees him in the crotch. He jumps up a bit)\nJoey: (in pain) Doesn't work...

        "prompt_0": "[PREVIOUSLY_ON]\nIhab: This act will be remembered as the first great act of defiance.\n(crowd chanting)\nJamal: Ihab Rashid is behind all this.\nSamira: I'm done wishing for change.\nI am making it happen.\nJamal: The wedding night is very special. It's important to be pure.\nMolly: It's not safe for you to be there.\nBarry: It's not safe for anyone there.\n(thumping)\nJamal: Run them down!\nLeila: Go!\nJamal: Tomorrow, there will be only pigeons in the square.\nBarry: What is it you want me to do?\nFauzi: I want you to get your hands dirty, to go against your family.\nBarry: I asked Fauzi Nidal to set up a meeting with Ihab Rashid.\nJamal: The man who would have all our heads?\nBarry: You can go down in history as one more brutal dictator, or you can be remembered as the leader who had the courage to listen to his people.\nWho do you want to be?\nIhab: Jamal has asked me to gather you, the leaders of the various factions who fill the Plaza, to meet with his American brother. This is the second time the Palace has come to me. The agitation in the Plaza, the galvanizing of the people, ooh, has them running scared. It's poker. Right now we have the winning hand. Why negotiate? Hmm? Nobody negotiated with Mubarak. No, no, no, no, no, no. When this Amriki walks in, I'm going to tell him exactly what it will take for us to clear the Plaza: his brother's resignation. Jamal Al Fayeed... he can, uh, take his blood money, go to... go to Paris. (laughter) Or go to London. Spend the rest of his days writing his memoirs.\nFarah: But what if he's actually willing to offer us something?\nIhab: No. His father betrayed my father. I'm not about to let him do the same thing to me. The only offer we will take is for Jamal Al Fayeed to leave Abbudin.\nFauzi: You sure about this?\nBarry: I'm sure of one thing. A narcissist with a messiah complex is not about to negotiate with me. Look, I'm betting Ihab told everyone in earshot that an Al Fayeed asked to sit down with him. He said yes so quickly, 'cause he wants to tell me where to go in front of an audience, but now he's gonna have to explain why he's sitting at the table alone. For my plan to work, I have to take him down a notch. Make the call.\nSamira: Father, where are you? Everyone's here, and they're... Okay. Okay. It's my father.\nIhab: You are late. What do you mean you are not coming?! That is bullshit!\n(chuckles)\n(engine stops)\n(Barry sighs)\nBarry: Thank you, my friend.\nFauzi: You know, I'm worried for you, Bassam.\nBarry: (chuckles) Been a while since anyone called me that.\nFauzi: You know this game you're playing, it's a dangerous game.\nBarry: I don't see another option.\nI have to clear the Plaza before Tariq does.\nJohn: The garage meet. Classic. This is insane. Why set a meet with Ihab so you can stand him up?\nBarry: Ihab's having his moment. He was never gonna bargain. So I had to take the wind out of his sails. Ihab's a boy. I want to see his father, the man who almost made peace with my father. I was here, Tucker, okay? I saw it. The people adored him. I need an hour with Sheik Rashid.\nJohn: So, you want to use Sheik Rashid to do an end run around Ihab? I mean, what... what happened to the nice family doctor from Pasadena?\nBarry: Don't screw me around, John. The U.S. brokered Sheik Rashid's asylum 20 years ago. I need to talk to him, and you know where he is.\nJohn: Does your brother even know you're here?\nBarry: I didn't say anything, because he'd never give me this much rope.\nJohn: Well, if you want to hang yourself with it, be my guest. Don't expect me to build the gallows.\nBarry: Tucker, I'm just trying to keep America's ass from landing on the wrong side of history.\nJohn: Uh-huh. Which doesn't involve turning you into another Daniel Pearl. My job is to protect American citizens, not serve them up. You end up dead in the desert in a trail that leads back to the U.S. Embassy...\nBarry: What do you want? In return, what do you want? An inside seat? A heads up on what's happening as it happens? (John sighs)\nJohn: Are you offering to spy on your brother?\nBarry: I have 24 hours. You have less.\nTariq: I need to speak to the president.\nSecretary: Uh... But he-he isn't... Shall I leave him a, um, message?\nLeila: Who drowned your puppy?\nTariq: Have you seen your husband?\nLeila: I'm not his keeper.\nTariq: At least tell me why he ordered me to stand down. I was about to send two brigades to the Plaza, and all of a sudden, he changes his mind with no explanation. He won't take my calls. He's cancelled his meetings for the day.\nLeila: The president isn't required to consult with his wife on every decision he makes.\nTariq: But as his wife, you should know. If Jamal isn't prepared to defend the regime, there are others who will.\nLeila: I hope, for your sake, you're not threatening my husband.\nTariq: On the contrary, I'm trying to protect him.\n(crowd clamoring over video)\n(rapid gunfire over video)\nIhab: Now these Al Fayeeds, they want to give us platitudes.\nLeila: He's a parrot.\nHis mouth moves, but other people's words come out. La Boétie, Guevara and his father, the Sheik.\nIhab: As men and women of...\nLeila: But you, you are in the position to make your own history.\nJamal: Start with a compliment, end with an ask. What do you want?\nLeila: Yesterday in the Plaza, they nearly killed you.\nJamal: You exaggerate.\nLeila: No, I was there, Jamal. Three weeks, and the people are already questioning your leadership. Now is the time to be firm, to show them that you are in control. Why are you holding back Tariq?\nJamal: Why? For you.\nLeila: For me?\nJamal: If I move against the Plaza, ten times as many will rise up against me, against my family. This is certain, Leila. So what do I do? I wait until tomorrow. Maybe these clouds will bring a storm. Or maybe something will happen to clear them.\nLeila: Is this you talking? Or is it Bassam? Maybe Ihab is not the only parrot in this country.\nJamal: Don't make the mistake of getting between me and my brother.\nMolly: Reema, what are you doing?\nReema: I was just straightening up.\nMolly: Hold on. Let me see what's in your pocket.\nReema: I'll be in the servants' quarters until the police arrive.\nMolly: Just wait. First tell me why you need Vicodin.\nReema: Not me. My brother Salam.\nMolly: What's wrong with him? Reema...\nReema: He broke his arm. He was fixing the roof and he fell.\nMolly: Well, if his arm is broken, he needs a doctor to set it. You have to take him to the hospital.\nReema: No hospital.\nMolly: Why not?\nReema: Please, ma'am.\nMolly: Okay, tell you what... You take me to see your brother, and this stays between us.\nReema: You will tell no one?\nMolly: No.\nAhmed: Where's the fire?\nNusrat: You smell like tequila. I have to help your grandma with seating arrangements, okay?\nAhmed: Baby, it's been a month and we still haven't... I didn't get married to take care of my own needs!\n(door slams)\nJamal: Mother, this is really beautiful.\nAmira: Not nearly as beautiful as your daughter-in-law.\nJamal: Yes, Ahmed is a lucky man.\nIs this my grandson I feel in there? Bassam is waiting for me.\nAmira: Your father would be so happy to see his two sons working together like this.\nJamal: He would have been.\nAmira: Are you all right, Nusrat? The ambassador is deaf in his left ear, so I'm going to put you on his right side.\nJamal: So... when am I sitting down with this asshole?\nBarry: I'm still working out the details.\nJamal: What details? He shows up when and where we say!\nBarry: Yeah, it's not... it's not quite as simple as that.\nJamal: It is simple. Who's the president, me or him?\n(groans)\nWhat aren't you telling me?\nBarry: Nothing. He's just, uh... the guy's playing hard to get.\nJamal: Hard to get? Maybe he will play nicer with electrodes on his balls.\nBarry: Can you please just give me a little more time?\nJamal: How much time do you think I have? I've already got Leila crawling up my ass. While you are out buying flowers for this shitball, I'm starting to look like some pussy who can't pull the trigger.\nBarry: Jamal, I'm working on it.\nJamal: Working on it? Well, stop working on it and get it done.\n(crowd clamoring)\nIhab: Abbudin!\nCrowd: Abbudin!\nIhab: He humiliated me.\nMohammed: Relax, relax.\nIhab: No, no, no, no, no! I'm not going to relax.\nHe can't do this. It makes me look like a fool. That was the point, wasn't it?\nMohammed: Take the mic, paint him as the liar he is!\nIhab: Oh, and look like a child who dropped his ice cream, huh? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What is the game he's playing?\nSamira: Same game as you are. You were only there to tell him off to his face.\nIhab: You... you knew all along Bassam was going to blow me off.\nSamira: What?! No! No!\nIhab: You set the location, set the time.\nSamira: Ihab, stop! You're letting your anger get the best of you at a time when the people need your leadership. People are trusting you with their lives. People I know! My friends!\nIhab: You don't think I know that, little girl? Hmm? I am not here by accident.\nCrowd (chanting): Free Abbudin! Free Abbudin! Free Abbudin! Free Abbudin!\nIhab: Abbudin!\nBarry: Jamal's given me 24 hours to see if I can clear the Plaza peacefully.\nMolly: What are you gonna do?\nBarry: Tucker is reaching out to Ihab's father, the Sheik, to try and arrange a meeting. Before my father launched the attack on Ma'an, he and the Sheik sat down for peace talks. Rashid was prepared to negotiate a peaceful solution.\nMolly: Yeah, and then he bombed the Palace.\nBarry: An army barracks. And it was his followers, not him. Look, 20 years ago, Rashid was prepared to negotiate with my father. Despite what happened, me sitting down with him now is the only hope we have to stop this blowing up in our faces.\nMolly: Who's going with you?\nBarry: I don't know all the details yet, okay? Tucker's gonna call me back. Until then, I'm going to go for a run, okay?\nMolly: So it's a suicide mission.\nBarry: That's blowing it out of proportion. And Molly, really, I don't have another choice here.\nMolly: Of course you have another choice. You also have two kids and a wife. I mean... you're gonna get yourself killed, Barry.\nBarry: Honey, we're not at home listening to this on NPR, we're in it. And I can do something my father couldn't... I can end this peacefully.\nMolly: That's Jamal's job, not yours. Why are you putting your life on this line for this?\nBarry: 'Cause my name's not Smith or Jones!\n(Molly scoffs)\nMolly: If I didn't know you better, I'd say you were starting to get off on this.\nAhmed: Hakim, I know Nusrat is here.\nHakim: Now is not a good time. She's upset.\nAhmed: Which is why she should be with her husband and not run to her parents like a child!\nWe had a thing this morning, now she's not returning my calls.\nHakim: I swear I'll talk sense into her. You have my word. Do have any idea what position you are putting our family in? Everything we have, it's all from Al Fayeeds!\nNusrat: I want a divorce.\nHakim: Don't be stupid. Why did you agree to marry Ahmed if you don't love him?\nSofia: Tell him.\nHakim: Tell me what? Tell me what?\nNusrat: It's not Ahmed. It's Jamal.\n(phone vibrating)\nBarry: Yeah.\nJohn: Barry, it's Tucker.\nThe person you wanted me to reach out to agreed to meet.\nBarry: Okay. I'll go back and tell Molly...\nJohn: You can call Molly from the road. I'm about to jump in the car. Meet me outside the gate.\nBarry: I'm on my way. All right, guys, that's it for the day.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJohn: Thank you for arranging this meeting with your father. Namir Rashid... Bassam Al Fayeed.\nNamir: Okay, come with me. Oh, no, no... you stay here.\nJohn: No, no, no, no, that wasn't the arrangement.\nNamir: I told my father we should kill him right here, but this is his wish. Turn around, Al Fayeed.\nBarry: It's okay.\nNamir: Do it.\nIhab (recorded): When this, uh, Amriki walks in here, I'm going to tell him exactly what it will take for us to clear the Plaza: his brother's resignation.\nTariq: Our security forces track Ihab Rashid's movements. Imagine their surprise and my embarrassment upon learning he was meeting with your brother.\nJamal: Bassam is working for me. He is meeting Ihab Rashid on my orders.\nTariq: Bassam's been nowhere near Ihab in the last 24 hours.\nJamal: That is wrong. That is wrong! I spoke to Bassam right after their meeting. He looked me in the eyes and told me they are ironing out details.\nTariq: Then he lied to you! He's had no contact with Ihab. As a matter of fact, Bassam ditched his security. He is nowhere to be found.\nLeila: This is why you refuse to clear the Plaza? Bassam... doesn't keep his promises.\nJamal: How the hell would you know?\nBarry (recorded): Hi, you've reached Barry Al Fayeed. Please leave your name and...\nTariq: Sir, at least allow me to move my forces into position.\n(Jamal sighs)\nJamal: Fine.\nBut they stand down until I give the order.\n(coughing)\nSheik Rashid: My lungs...\n(clears throat)\nA souvenir of the day your father gassed Ma'an. You met my son, Namir.\nBarry: Yeah, he, uh... he drove me from the border. The hood kind of limited the conversation.\nSheik Rashid: You understand our precautions.\nBarry: Yes.\nSheik Rashid: I have always been curious about Khaled's American son.\n(gunshot)\nMan: Death to the Al Fayeed!\n(grunts) Death to the Al Fayeed! Death to the Al Fayeeds!\nSheik Rashid: I apologize for his actions, but his anger is understandable. His family was wiped out by yours. Bassam Al Fayeed, yesterday you were my enemy, but today you are my guest.\nBarry: Sheik Rashid, I need to talk to you about...\nSheik Rashid: That's not the way it's done. First, we eat.\nHakim: Mr. President, you are too kind, taking time away from important issues of state to deal with a personal matter.\nLeila: To what do we owe this pleasure?\nHakim: Marriage... it's a complicated proposition, and Nusrat has always been... fragile. Overly emotional. My wife and I are to blame. We coddled her.\nJamal: Cut to the chase.\nHakim: We ask for nothing, just a quick and quiet dissolution of the marriage.\nLeila: Divorce? On what grounds? Tell me, Hakim. We have welcomed your daughter to this family as one of our own. Ahmed is my son. I demand to know what this is about.\nHakim: Please, ma'am, are the details really important?\n(Jamal groans)\nJamal: Will you wait for me outside?\nHakim: Sure.\n(door closes)\nJamal: I will fix this.\nLeila: You'd better.\nWe can't afford another humiliation.\nJamal: I said I will fix this.\n(gunshot)\nYour turn.\nHakim: I'm no match for you.\nJamal (chuckles): Yeah. That's true. So, tell me, Hakim, what is this nonsense about a divorce? Your daughter has everything a woman could want. Why you don't talk sense to her?\nHakim: Believe me, Mr. President, I have tried.\nJamal: \"Tried.\" Well, not hard enough. My father gave you the telecommunication franchise in this country. Now, your family has everything it has because my family gave it to you.\nHakim: And I'm forever in your debt.\nJamal: Then act like it.\nHakim: Please, I beg you. There is no talking sense with a sleepwalker. She's in a doctor's care. He prescribes therapy, medication. My daughter is weak, and your son did his best.\nJamal: \"Did his best\"? Are you saying this is Ahmed's fault?\nHakim: No, of course not.\nJamal: Then what are you saying? What reason did she give?\n(chuckles)\nHakim: I swear, she will go to the grave with her secret.\nJamal: Tell me what she told you.\nHakim: Uh, it doesn't matter.\nJamal: You know what, you are right.\nIt doesn't matter.\n(muffled screaming)\nThere will be no divorce, Hakim.\n(Hakim groaning)\nYour whore of a daughter is going to crawl back into my son's bed! She will bear him children. As many as he wants.\nHakim: Mr. President, please! Please, sir!\n(gunshot)\n(screaming)\nMolly: It's not just his arm.\nHe fractured multiple ribs when he fell. His pulse is racing and weak. He's anxious. (sighs) Reema, with this kind of injury, he could be bleeding on the inside. It's okay, it's okay. We're gonna get you to a hospital.\nReema: I said no hospital.\nMolly: He wasn't fixing a roof, was he?\nReema: He was in the Plaza. When the president's motorcade came, people, they start pushing. He is innocent, but the camera, they saw him. If he seeks help now, they'll arrest him.\nMolly: He'll die if he doesn't.\nReema: Better to die here than live through what they will do to him. His friends in the Plaza, they tagged a street sign with \"free Abbudin\" and were arrested. When their father went to the police, begged for his children, he was told to make new ones. Salam is my only family. Please, help us.\nEmt: What's his name?\n(indistinct radio transmission)\nReema: Salam.\nSalam Halabi.\nMolly: Radial fracture, multiple broken ribs, suspected hemothorax from intercostal hemorrhaging. We need to throw in a chest tube.\nEmt: I'm sorry, but you can't take this man. He is wanted by the authorities. We have to alert the police...\nMolly: He'll die if you wait.\nEmt: Before we admit him to the hospital. Then he'll die.\nMolly: No, he won't. I won't let him.\nEmt: And who are you?\nMolly: Dr. Molly Al Fayeed.\nEmt: We were just following the law. A thousand pardons.\nMolly: You don't... you don't need to apologize to me. Just get him to the hospital. You know what, why don't I come with you and make sure no one else makes the same mistake.\nNamir: Bless Allah for protecting us and for all that we have.\nSheik Rashid: Alhamdulillah.\nAll: Alhamdulillah.\nSheik Rashid: I see you are anxious to talk.\nBarry: Yes.\nSheik Rashid: Walk with me.\n(Sheik Rashid coughs)\nYou made a long trip to avoid the more obvious choice.\nBarry: Ihab doesn't want to talk. He wants his turn, and that's not going to happen.\n(Sheik Rashid laughs)\nSheik Rashid: You must be worried.\nOtherwise, you are not here.\nBarry: I'm worried about the price we'll have to pay for either side to win. There's a book I-I read about apartheid in South Africa. A white man says about the blacks, \"my greatest fear\" \"is that by the time we have come to love,\" \"they will have come to hate.\"\nSheik Rashid: Have you come to love?\nBarry: I've come to talk. You and I have more in common than anyone else in this. We're both exiled... for different reasons... by force or by choice. But we both have the advantage of an outsider's perspective.\nSheik Rashid: You came back. Why?\nBarry: To try and keep my brother from making my father's mistakes. Finish with my brother what you started with my father. Negotiate a political solution.\nSheik Rashid: This is a young man's fight.\nBarry: And I need an old man to be my partner. Someone who wants nothing for himself.\nSheik Rashid: You think that's me?\nBarry: Well, I think we both have a second chance here to make this right. You and I both know history. If we don't try, then your son or my brother and so many people along with them will be consumed by this. Imprisoned, exiled... or dead within a year.\nSheik Rashid: Death doesn't scare me... Bassam Al Fayeed. I've seen too much of it.\n(Sheik Rashid coughs)\nBarry: I don't believe you. w After 20 years, you're still alive.\nI'm a doctor. I believe that life itself is hope. And I think that you do, too.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJohn: You didn't close the deal.\nBarry: Thought it was going in the right direction.\nHe... just said he needed to sleep on it. But when he woke up...\nJohn: Well, you may have failed, but, uh, the reach... It was impressive. Get in. I'll take you back to the Palace.\n(crowd clamoring over video)\n(rapid gunfire over video)\nJamal: General... (sighs)\nClear the Plaza.\n(crowd clamoring) (whistle blowing)\nIhab: They're moving into the Plaza.\nMohammed: After your speech, there's a van waiting for you.\nSamira: Ihab.\nSo, when they start shooting, you won't be standing with the people?\n(whistle blowing)\nCrowd (chanting): Free Abbudin! Free Abbudin!\n(chanting, clamoring continues)\n(helicopter hovering overhead)\nFauzi: Samira.\nLet's go before it's too late.\nSamira: I'm not leaving.\nFauzi: You would die for him?\nSamira: Ihab may be trying to replace one tyranny with another. But the people... they won't let him. And I'm standing here with them.\nFauzi: I'll stand with you.\nLeila: Thank you for coming.\nSofia: How can you do this? You're feeding her to the wolves.\nHakim: It's not like we have a choice.\nSofia: She's our daughter.\nAmira: Hakim. What happened to you?\nHakim: It's nothing. A hunting accident.\nAmira: And yet you're here. What one does for family. Nusrat.\nLeila: Beautiful as ever. It's all for you. Everything here... Is all for you.\nAhmed: Nusrat.\nNusrat: Everything's going to be okay.\nAhmed: Come. Let's greet everyone.\nNusrat: Okay.\nLeila: Enjoy the party.\n(Jamal sighs)\nJamal: Look at the newlyweds.\nLeila: What a persuasive man.\n(both sighing)\nBarry: You were right.\nWhy did I think I could come here and do something my father couldn't? Thank you... for putting your life on hold for me. Being here with me.\nMolly: I think I really needed to hear that.\nCrowd (chanting): Free Abbudin! Free Abbudin!\nIhab: Raise your phones! Record this moment in history! As long as we have a camera, the revolution continues!\n(crowd cheering)\nAnd if... if we are the first martyrs to liberate Abbudin, then so be it!\n(crowd cheering)\nI stand with you, my brothers and sisters.\nCrowd (chanting): Free Abbudin!\nIhab: I stand with you, united... united... unite...\n(crowd quiets)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(applause)\nSheik Rashid: Brothers... and sisters.\n20 years in exile, but I have come home. (crowd cheering)\nTariq: Your brother is back.\nJamal: Excuse me. Liar. You told me you were going to meet Ihab Rashid. I trusted you. You are my blood, and you betrayed me.\nMolly: Jamal.\nJamal: No, Molly. If your husband is a traitor, I need to know.\nMolly: He's not a traitor.\nTariq: He deceived the president. Threatened our national security.\nJohn: Mr. President. General. Uh, you need to see something.\nSheik Rashid: Willing to put aside the atrocities of the past, to join our cause. I demand to sit down with president Jamal Al Fayeed. (crowd cheering)\nJamal: He demands?\nSheik Rashid: Free Abbudin!\nCrowd: Free Abbudin! Free Abbudin! Free Abbudin!\n(chanting continues)\nBarry: This is it.\nYou can finish something our father couldn't. Pardon the Sheik and sit down with him.\nTariq: This is insane. Our soldiers are in place, awaiting your order.\nBarry: Then stand them down. Jamal, you can end this without firing a shot. This is what you wanted.\nJamal: Is it?\n(breathes deeply)\n(chanting continues over TV)\nGeneral, tell your men to stand down.\nTariq: But, Mr. President...\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The text is a summary of the events leading up to the liberation of Abbudin, a fictional country in the Middle East. The text begins with the assassination of the president's father, who was a leader of the Abbudin revolution. The president's brother, Jamal, is forced to flee the country and goes into exile. Meanwhile, the president's wife, Molly, is kidnapped by the rebels and held hostage. The president's cousin, Tariq, is appointed as the new leader of the country and begins to negotiate with the rebels. The president's son, Barry, joins the military and becomes a key player in the conflict. The president eventually decides to meet with the rebels and negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict. However, the rebels demand the pardon of the Sheik Rashid, a rebel leader, and the president's brother, Jamal, who is also a rebel. The president agrees to meet with the Sheik and Jamal, but his military advisors are skeptical of the plan. Ultimately, the president decides to stand down his military and meet with the rebels, which leads to the liberation of Abbudin.</s>The invention provides a method for preparing a high-purity nano-silicon"

Hot, perfect s*x requires shaved legs.\nGeorge: Okay.\n(Richard, and Derek walk up to the nurse's station where Erica is standing)\nRichard: Erica Hahn...first day.\nErica: Oh, first day indeed, and a mountain of paperwork to prove it.\nRichard: Derek Shepherd, you know Erica Hahn.\nDerek: You're the new Burke.\n(Mark walks up)\nRichard: And this is Dr. Mark Sloan, head of plastics. Erica Hahn.\nMark: Ah, the new Burke.\nDerek: Welcome. Excuse us.\n(Mark and Derek step aside)\nErica: Interesting guys, and by \"interesting\" I mean ridiculously attractive. Do you hire on looks alone, or is actual skill a factor?\nRichard: Good to have you here, Erica.\nErica: Good to be here, Richard.\n(Derek and Mark)\nMark: What exactly is a gentlemen's evening?\nDerek: I don't know. It's an evening with gentlemen.\nMark: And strippers?\nDerek: No, I don't...I don't think the chief meant strippers.\nMark: Sure sounds like strippers. Dr. Bailey? What's the first thing that comes to mind when I say the words \"gentlemen's evening\"?\nBailey: Tassels. Shiny, sequined tassels and $1 bills.\nMark: See? Strippers.\nDerek: There will be no strippers. I'm almost positive.\nMark: So you don't know what this thing is either?\nDerek: No, but you're in?\nMark: Why not? I like to be surprised.\n(Cristina and Meredith are at a nurse's station)\nCristina: Okay. Oh, heads-up. Mr.Incredible,12:00.\n(Derek walks by)\nDerek: Hi.\nMeredith: Hi.\nCristina: What the hell was that about?\nMeredith: That was about a date we have later in the on call room. It's nothing.\nCristina: Well, you sure seem to be losing sleep over a whole lot of \"nothing.\n(Meredith and Cristina enter the ambulance bay)\nCristina: This is it...Hahn is in the hospital, freakin' Izzie is on her service again. I'm gonna ride this trauma train straight back into cardio.\nCallie: Okay, what do we got?\nMeredith: Uh, two ambulances, multiple traumas.\nAlex: Any chance you need a resident's help, Dr. Torres?\nCallie: As long as you want to smash bones into dust while people cry.\nAlex: Sweet. What do you got?\nCristina: Chest pain, tamponade, ruptured aorta?\nAmbulance Driver: Uh, more like a clown car. Jackie Escott, 25 years old, dislocated shoulder, lac to her thigh, vital signs are stable. And Helena Boyd, 26 years old...also stable with obvious nasal fracture, facial lacs and a chunk of missing scalp.\nHelena: She ripped out my hair.\nJackie: She ripped out my shoulder!\nHelena: You ripped out your own shoulder when you were trying to push me off of the platform!\nFiancé 1: Who let go of the dress? Did anybody let go of the dress?\nFiancé 2: Hang in there, honey. Don't let her psych you out, all right?\nCallie: Okay, what the hell's all this?\nJudge: It's a store contest. I'm the judge. Last one to let go of the dress...\nHelena: Wins the wedding of my dreams.\nJackie: Of my dreams.\nCallie: All right, enough. You two are injured, okay? You need to get your priorities straight and let go of the...let go...let go of the dress so we can treat you. All right, let go now. Now.\nHelena: Yeah, that's not gonna happen.\nCallie: All right. Fine. Let's move.\nCristina: Oh, please let this be something good, something cardio good. Please.\nAmbulance Driver 2: 33-year-old male discovered unconscious but stable having survived a 12,000-foot free fall.\nCristina: A what?\nAmbulance Driver: His parachute didn't open.\nCristina: Wait, he fell 12,000 feet without a parachute? Thank you.\n(In the ER)\nBailey: What's his name?\nRick: Rick. I'm Rick Jacobs.\nBailey: He's talking?\nCristina: You'd think after 12,000 feet, he'd have at least a punctured lung.\n(A woman runs up)\nSally: Where is he? Where are you? Oh, my god. There you are. How is he? How is he? Is he okay? Is he dying?\nRick: No, I'm not dying, Sally.\nBailey: Okay, ma'am, you need to calm down.\nMeredith: Is this your wife?\nRick: My skydiving instructor.\nBailey: Well, ma'am...\nSally: I watched the whole thing. I...I couldn't do anything. I was just...I was just in the clouds floating,\nwatching while he...while he...while he...you...you fell to your death. His chute didn't open.\nBailey: Ma'am, okay, we need to do our jobs, and you're making that difficult by hovering over the patient. Please have a seat and breathe.\n(Richard enters)\nRichard: I heard we have a skydiver who fell 12,000 feet.\nRick: That'd be me.\nRichard: Uh, hello.\nRick: Hi.\nRichard: He's talking?\nBailey: Clearly he's in shock, can't feel the extent of his injuries.\nDerek: Let's get him down for a C.T.\nMeredith: Cristina, where are you going?\nCristina: Multiple injuries means multiple surgeries. I'm going to get me some cardio.\n(ER)\nCallie: Okay, do you see that you're bleeding all over the dress?\nJackie: It's not about the dress.\nAlex: I can't, uh, I can't...there's too much blood down here. Which one of your legs is bleeding?\nHelena: I don't know. I can't really feel anything anymore.\nMark: I hear you have a broken nose down here. What's with the dress?\nJackie: It's not about the dress.\nCallie: Can't they...can't they just split the prize?\nJudge: I offered. I offered that 14 hours ago.\nJackie: It is a $100,000 wedding package, and I am not splitting it with anyone.\nGeorge: Oh, you're bleeding on your dress.\nEveryone: It's not about the dress!\nCallie: Uh, uh, I'm gonna have to stabilize that shoulder somehow.\nAlex: I'll go grab a sling.\n(Mark and Callie step aside)\nMark: Well, this is cozy.\nCallie: This is hell. I assigned O'Malley to you to keep him away from me, and now our patients are connected to each other.\nMark: You're not looking at this like the opportunity it is.\nCallie: Meaning?\nMark: Meaning he's an intern. It's, like, half my job, torturing interns.\nCallie: Thanks. That's...that's almost sweet. But torturing George is not gonna make any of this any better. Torture him how, exactly?\n(Izzie is with Mr. Arnold)\nMr. Arnold: My hands always get so sweaty in hospitals. It's the weirdest thing.\nIzzie: It's pretty common, actually. If it makes you feel any better, Dr. Hahn has done this procedure hundreds of times.\nMr. Arnold: And she's really gonna thread a catheter up my leg, all the way to my heart?\nIzzie: Trust me, you are in excellent hands.\nMr. Arnold: But, um, I...I'll be out, right?\nIzzie: Oh, yeah, you'll be asleep. You won't remember a thing.\nMr. Arnold: Ivory-billed woodpecker.\nIzzie: I'm sorry?\nMr. Arnold: Ivory-billed woodpecker...that's what's getting me through this. I'm a, uh, lifelong birdwatcher. And when I get through this, I am finally going to scout the ivory-billed woodpecker.\nIt is so rare. You know, we...we thought it was extinct. But it's not. It lives in Arkansas...in this one little patch of swamp. Do you have any idea how incredible it is to see a bird like that in person?\nIzzie: I'm sorry.\n(Cristina enters)\nIzzie: Uh, I'll be just one second. Why are you hovering?\nCristina: Guess what just came into the pit. No, no, don't guess. I'll tell you. Skydiver. Skydiver whose chute didn't open, who fell 12,000 feet and landed in some shrubbery.\nIzzie: Poor guy. He probably broke every bone in his body.\nCristina: No, the point is not poor guy. The point is amazing surgery. And it could be yours for the low, low price of a humdrum, everyday cardio cath.\nIzzie: Yeah, forget it. I'm not giving up Hahn's service.\nCristina: Hey, hey, Izzie, you know what? Cardio is my thing.\nIzzie: No. I like this patient, I like Hahn, and I like cardio.\nCristina: No, you are...you are flirting with cardio. I am married to cardio. You will marry general surgery or, you know, okay, perhaps neuro. But you, you are nowhere near hard-core enough to commit to cardio.\nIzzie: So you are telling me to stop flirting with your husband. I get it. That's cute. But if you're gonna ask me for a favor, insulting my personal life is probably not a great tactic.\nCristina: No, no, no, wait. I am not talking about your s*x life. I could not care less about your s*x life.\nIt's a skydiver, Izzie. Skydiver.\nIzzie: Oh, yeah. Sounds really cool. Enjoy it.\n(CT scan room for Rick)\nRichard: If his intestines look like I think they will, that's gonna take first priority.\nDerek: He could have delayed paralysis.\nBailey: This is not a contest, gentlemen. But since a perfed bowel could kill the guy whether or not his spine's in working order, my money's on the chief going first.\n(Cristina enters)\nCristina: Hey, what'd I miss? Any cardiothoracic concerns? I'd be happy to page Dr. Hahn.\nRichard: Scan's coming up.\nBailey: Here it is. Wait for it. Wait.\nCristina: Wait.\nMeredith: Oh, that can't be right, can it?\nBailey: I'm not seeing any free fluid, any intraperitoneal gases.\nDerek: Does anybody see anything?\nRichard: There! Right there. A hematoma...\nCristina: In the right lower quadrant.\nMeredith: It's the appendix.\nBailey: We're saying this guy fell 12,000 feet, and basically all he needs is an appendectomy?\n(Alex enters the closet where Lexie is sitting on the floor)\nAlex: You're charting... in a closet.\nLexie: I get a lot of work done in here. It's quiet and nice.\nAlex: And a closet.\nLexie: Look...when I'm out there roaming the floors, okay, I am the other Grey that Dr. Yang likes to humiliate and kick around. And...and in here, I'm...I'm not. You know, in...in here, I'm...it's just...it's...it's my place, okay?\nAlex: It's...it's a closet. You know, every intern class has its runt of the litter. You keep this up, this year it's gonna be you. Get up.\nLexie: Oh, sorry. You probably need to get in here.\nAlex: No, grab...grab a sling from the box and come with me.\nLexie: With you?\nAlex: Well, if you'd rather sit like a loser in a closet doing charts, you can. Or you can come help me on ortho today. Your choice.\n(ER)\nJackie: No way. No frickin' way.\nCalie: It's the only solution if neither of you will let go of the dress.\nMark: It's very simple. Dr. Torres needs to treat Jackie's shoulder and leg, so, Jackie, you need a proxy.\nHelena: What?\nFiancé 2: Think about it, babe. This gives you an advantage. You get to rest your hand and come back refreshed. Give me the dress. I'll be the proxy.\nFiancé 1: No way. This isn't fair. You think this is fair?\nMark: Dr. O'Malley's the proxy.\nGeorge: What?\nMark: He'll hold on to the dress.\nGeorge: Hold the dress? You just want me to...stand here and hold a dress?\nMark: No one ever said internship was easy.\nFiancé 1: Dude, you're job kinda sucks, huh?\nJackie: Hello? Watch the shoulder.\n(Alex and Lexie enter)\nAlex: Oh, check it out. Bambi's a bridesmaid.\nCallie: You're right. This did cheer me up.\n(Trauma room)\nBailey: You've got no lung injuries, no spinal injuries, no broken bones. You're just a lucky man.\nRick: Holy crap.\nBailey: The only thing we found was a little bleeding in your lower abdomen.\nMeredith: Which means we have to remove your appendix.\nRick: How's that even possible?\nBailey: Uh, the body's an amazing thing. You know, sometimes these things, they just happen.\nSally: If you had died... God.\nRick: I didn't though. I lived. It's just the most amazing feeling. I feel like I could do anything right now. I mean, anything in the world because I faced death and I...I survived.\nMeredith: It changes a person.\nRick: It does. It so does. Sally...Sal, I have to...I want to, um...\nSally: Don't worry. The minute...the minute we get out of here, I am so destroying that video. You will never have to...to relive that horrible...in fact, where's your helmet? I'm gonna destroy that video right now.\nRick: Sally. Sal...wait.\nCristina: Did she say \"video\"?\n(Mr. Arnold's surgery)\nErica: The trick is to envision the artery like a spaghetti noodle...pliable, but not too fragile.\nRichard: Good morning.\nErica: Oh, this is an unexpected surprise, chief. You need something?\nRichard: Oh, first day. Just wanted to see how you were settling in.\nErica: You see that?\nIzzie: It's a blockage, left main coronary artery. It's totally closed off.\nErica: There's no way I'm getting a stent in there. We're gonna have to open him up.\nIzzie: B.P.'S dropping to 58 over 20.\nRichard: His heart's racing.\nErica: And his temp's rising. Muscles are rigid. All right, let's bring him off anesthesia and start him on 100% o-2. He's got malignant hypothermia.\nIzzie: So he's allergic to the anesthesia?\nRichard: He'll never be able to endure the cabg.\nIzzie: So what are our options?\n(MR. Arnold's room after he wakes up)\nMr. Arnold: That's just, uh...I mean, it sounds like you're telling me...you're not actually telling me I'm... I'm gonna die?\nErica: The blockage we found in your heart needs surgery, extensive surgery. Angioplasty won't work. And since you're allergic to the anesthesia...\nMr. Arnold: So I'll just, uh...I'll be like this. I'll be sick...and exhausted...and like this...until one day when I'll...just, uh...die. It would've been wonderful...to see that bird. It would've been wonderful.\n(ER)\nMark: You're crowding me, O'Malley.\nFiancé 2: Hey, hey, I think he just let go. You just let go of the dress, didn't you?\nGeorge: No.\nJudge: I wish to god he had.\nFiancé 1: I swear, if you let go and lose this contest after my Jackie almost died to win it\nFiancé 2: Dude, a busted shoulder does not mean she almost died. Okay?\nFiancé 1: Whatever. I'm watching you.\nHelena: I know you all think this is stupid. If I were you, I would think this is really stupid.\nMark: I've never been married myself, so I'm not one to judge, but George here knows all about what it takes. Don't you, O'Malley?\nHelena: You're married? For how long?\nGeorge: Not very long.\nHelena: Newlyweds, congratulations.\nGeorge: Thanks.\n(Trauma room)\nCallie: Now, Jackie, Dr. Karev and I are gonna do this on the count of three, okay?\nJackie: I should totally win over that Helena girl. I am way more injured than she is. I should just win by default.\nCallie: One...two...three.\nJackie: Is it in?\nAlex: It popped back out.\nCallie: She's gonna need surgery.\nJackie: Hey, no. I gotta get back to my dress. Just wrap some bandages around it or something.\nCallie: You would rather hold on to a dress with a dislocated shoulder than let me repair it in surgery for you right now?\nJackie: I can have surgery anytime. I can only win this wedding once.\n(ER)\nCristina: So what, he just stands there and holds a dress?\nMeredith: I know. I thought it was gonna be more exciting, too.\nCristina: A monkey could hold a dress.\nGeorge: Actually, this is a lot harder than it looks.\nHelena: Don't let them get to you. Tune them out, all of them. It's the only way to get through it.\nFiancé 2: Sweetie, he's your competition. Don't help him.\nJudge: You ever give morphine to people who aren't patients?\nCristina: This kinda blows.\nAlex: It's more fun when you heckle.\nMeredith: Don't heckle, George.\nCristina: Yeah, whatever. I got something way better than this.\nAlex: Something that tops O'Malley playing bride?\nCristina: Skydiver video.\n(Cristina, Alex, Izzie and Meredith are in an office)\nIzzie: What are we doing?\nAlex: Video from the helmet of a skydiver without a chute.\nIzzie: You guys are sick.\nCristina: Oh, it's not a snuff film. The guy survives.\nAlex: Holy...\nCristina: Oh, is he...oh, no, he's going for it. He's going for the chute. Oh, and it doesn't open.\nMeredith: Now he's flailing.\nAlex: He's going for his second chute.\nIzzie: Oh, jeez.\nCristina: Oh, also doesn't open.\nIzzie: You'd think there'd be more screaming.\nMeredith: Oh, ok how close the ground is getting.\nAlex: What's he doing now?\nCristina: Peeing his pants.\nMeredith: Is he saying something? Turn it up.\nRick: God, I wish would've told you. I am so in love with you. I love you. I love you. I love you, Sally. I...\nAll: Ohh!\nIzzie: Who's sally?\nMeredith: His skydiving instructor.\nIzzie: Sad.\nCristina: Hey, what are you even doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in surgery?\nIzzie: The guy is allergic to anesthesia. The surgery was canceled.\n(Meredith and Cristina are in an exam room)\nMeredith: I drowned. I was sinking...I died. And you know what I realized? I realized how stupid\nall of my issues are.\nCristina: I'm waiting for how this applies to me.\nMeredith: It doesn't.\nCristina: Of course not.\nMeredith: Well, that man fell, and all he wanted was one last chance to tell sall how he felt about her. And I got one last chance. I got my chance. And what have I done with it?\nCristina: You know, being aware of your crap and actually overcoming your crap are two very different things.\nMeredith: I know.\nCristina: Okay, found it.\n(Cristina is in the hall with Erica)\nCristina: Dr. Hahn, I know how you can do the surgery on the patient who is allergic to anesthesia.\nErica: Well, no anesthesia means no ventilator. No ventilator means no cabg. Not a whole lot of wiggle room there.\nCristina: You can operate on him while he's awake.\nErica: Yang...\nCristina: You can use a high thoracic epidural to numb him from the chest down. Let him breathe on his own the entire time. I mean, they pulled it off in India last month, and then again in...\n(Izzie walks up)\nIzzie: Dr. Hahn, you wanted to sign the discharge papers for Mr. Arnold?\nErica: Not quite yet.\n(Mr. Arnold's room)\nMr. Arnold: Wide awake? You want me to let you slice open my chest while I'm wide awake?\nErica: It is your best option.\nMr. Arnold: Uh, how...how long would I have to be lying there, uh, on the table with my chest open, uh, like that?\nErica: The surgery can take up to five or six hours. Maybe more.\nMr. Arnold: Uh, six hours...awake...with you operating on my heart. I...\nIzzie: The ivory-billed woodpecker.\nErica: What?\nCristina: What?\nIzzie: The ivory-billed woodpecker. Mr. Arnold, you want to live to see it, don't you? This is your only chance.\nMr. Arnold: Ivory-billed woodpecker.\nErica: Excellent. Stevens, we will scrub in as soon as an OR is free.\nIzzie: Uh, but the surgery was Cristina's idea.\nErica: Either you want in or you don't. Which is it?\nIzzie: I do.\nCristina: Uh, but...\nErica: I'm sure there'll be standing room in the gallery, Yang. Stevens, book the OR.\nDerek: Uh, chief.\nRichard: Awake open-heart surgery?\nDerek: I want to talk to you about tonight.\nRichard: Have you heard about this awake open-heart surgery?\nDerek: I've invited Sloan and, um, well, I'm wondering what I should tell him to expect.\nRichard: Mm, tell him to expect a good time.\nDerek: Okay, so what is that, poker, cigars, whiskey? I mean, what kind of things?\nRichard: A good time, Shep.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Jackie's room)\nJackie: You know? You have no idea the kind of stamina it takes to stand in a display window for two days. It's the hardest thing I've ever done, like, ever.\nCallie: You're risking permanent damage to your shoulder over a contest.\nLexie: What does your dress look like?\nJackie: Strapless, sweetheart neckline, crystal beading...so pretty.\nLexie: But you're gonna wear your hair down, though, right? You know, to cover the hunchback?\nJackie: The what?\nLexie: Oh, it's just, since you're ignoring Dr .Torres' advice about getting the surgery, you know, your shoulder is probably gonna be pretty swollen and purple...you know, kind of like a hunchback? But your hair should totally cover it. I mean, probably, with the right veil.\nJackie: You didn't tell me that. How soon can we have the surgery?\n(Mark and Derek are in the hall with Erica)\nMark: Dr. Hahn, I heard a crazy rumor about you.\nErica: That I'm performing open-heart surgery on a man who's wide awake?\nMark: That's the rumor.\nErica: That's the truth.\nDerek: Well, I perform awake brain surgery all the time.\nErica and Mark: Not the same thing.\nMark: You ever heard of a gentlemen's evening?\nErica: I'm sorry?\nDerek: The chief is hosting a gentlemen's evening.\nMark: We're pretty sure it doesn't involve p0rn, but, you know, we want to be sure.\nErica: Right. Are you two a couple?\nMark and Derek: No.\nErica: Just checking.\nDerek: Why would she ask that?\nMark: I don't know. I'm...I'm worried about this gentlemen's thing.\n(ER)\nIzzie: George...you got a second?\nGeorge: Seriously? One sec.\nIzzie: Hi. We're gonna have to push back our perfect evening tonight. Not by much...a few hours, I think.\nGeorge: Sure.\nIzzie: Okay. I'm about to scrub in on an awake open-heart surgery.\nGeorge: A what?\nIzzie: Awake. The patient's gonna be wide awake while we operate on his heart.\nHelena: That is intense.\nIzzie: It is. It is intense. It's...you know, Cristina would be all over this. She would be studying and quizzing herself, and all I can think about is...is the poor guy. You know, he's really nervous already, and...I'm not hard-core. I'm not hard-core enough for this.\nGeorge: Yes, you are. What, you're just...you're just not like Cristina. You're hard-core. You're hard-core like Izzie. Did that just sound dirty? 'Cause that's not how I meant it.\nFiancé 2: Mean it, man.\nGeorge: Shut...go kick ass in the surgery, and then we'll have our night, and it will be perfect.\nIzzie: Oh, I have not shaved my legs yet.\nGeorge: Go be hard-core Izzie. Go.\nIzzie: Okay, got it. Going Thank you.\nGeorge: Bye.\nFiancé 2: She's hot, man.\nHelena: Is she your wife?\nGeorge: I don't know you well enough to have this conversation.\n(Erica enters Richard's office)\nErica: Chief, you paged?\nRichard: Close the door. You had the nerve to tell a patient you would perform awake open-heart surgery without running it past me?\nErica: Did Burke run every surgery past you?\nRichard: Erica, I know you're new here...\nErica: No.\nRichard: But we run...\nErica: I just want to know what the rules are. Every surgery Burke booked, he ran it up the flagpole first? And what about pretty and prettier? They run all their surgeries past you?\nRichard: Wait, you're talking about Shepherd and Sloan?\nErica: I am talking about your male attendings. You know, the ones you invited to your gentlemen's evening? Guess you don't know a guy till you work for him. I mean, who knew you were running some kind of old boys' club?\nRichard: No, that is not it. What we were...\nErica: You realize that an evening to which the male attendings are invited and the women are not...you realize that that's a lot like when law firms used to have country club weekends and failed to invite the black socialites?\nErica: Good talk. I gotta prep for my surgery.\n(Meredith and Derek are in bed)\nMeredith: Remember when I was dead? Before I went in that water, everything was so...complicated and hard. And then you pulled me out of the water. And I came back to life. For a moment, everything was so clear...as if the water had washed everything clean. Do you remember that?\nDerek: I do.\nMeredith: Me, too.\n(Izzie lays down on a OR bed and sees what it would be like to be operated on while awake)\n(ER)\nGeorge: I don't know how you guys did this for two days.\nHelena: Believe me, I would be at city hall tomorrow if that were an option.\nGeorge: It is an option. You could just...let go.\nHelena: You let go.\nGeorge: You let go, and it's no big deal. It's a wedding. I let go, and I have to face the wrath of Dr. Sloan.\nHelena: My mom manages a grocery store, and ever since I got engaged, she's been putting herself into serious debt over hand-engraved place cards and chocolate fountains. It's her dream. My wedding is her dream. This is so important to her. This is what she's been living for since I can remember, since...my dad left. My perfect night. So...I can do this. I can do this for her...because she's done a lot for me.\n(Jackie collapses)\nGeorge: Get me a crash cart right now.\n(Helena's surgery)\nGeorge: Must have happened when she fell this morning, which means she was bleeding all day. She seemed just fine.\nRichard: She must have been feeling some major pain.\nGeorge: Yeah, holding on to that dress, that wasn't easy for her. It was humiliating. It was...but when someone's trying to break you, it gives you drive, gives you strength. Holding on to that dress for hours...I mean, days...you know, just...and in public, refusing to buckle, refusing to be...thats hard-core. I mean, in its own way, that's seriously hard-core.\nRichard: Rumor has it that Sloan was busy hazing one of his interns today. I take it you didn't buckle.\nGeorge: No, sir.\nRichard: Good man, O'Malley.\n(Mr. Arnolds OR)\nMr. Arnold: Uh, I can't feel anything from the neck down. It's almost like the rest of me just...doesn't exist.\nIzzie: Okay, the sound you're about to hear, that's the saw.\nMr. Arnold: That...that's not a pretty sound. I brought you some music. Just listen to this and tune it all out.\nMr. Arnold: And...and...and that smell. That...that smell is not...\nIzzie: That's the cautery. I...I know it's hard, but you'll get used to it. In a moment or two, you won't even notice it. I promise.\n(Rick's OR)\nBailey: He jumped out of that plane. No one forced him to do it. Fell 12,000 feet. People chasing death down, then trying to cheat it. Doesn't make any kind of sense to me.\nMeredith: There's a clarity thing. When you cross over the edge, there's a moment when everything...just melts away, and you're fearless. I get it. I understand wanting to feel like that.\n(Jackie's recovery room)\nCallie: You're awake.\nJackie: Did I win?\nCallie: You should know that your surgery went very well.\nJackie: But who won? Is she still holding on?\nAlex: Helena collapsed. She's in surgery.\nJackie: So...so I won? She...she collapsed, which...which means I won, right? Where...where's the judge?\nCallie: You...the woman that you stood next to for two days almost died. Okay, you've just woken up from surgery, and all that you can think about is if you won a stupid contest? Don't you get it? You...you shouldn't have to fight this hard for a wedding. You fight for a marriage, and sometimes even that is a lost cause. Sometimes you have to know when to let go. So just let go already, all right? Just frickin' let go.\nJackie: Yeah, but...did I win?\n(Cristina is in the gallery with Derek)\nCristina: Izzie stuck a picture of a bird on an empty saline bag and put it in his eyeline.\nDerek: That's smart. I wouldn't have thought of that.\nCristina: Yeah.\nDerek: She doesn't let me take care of her. It's not my job anymore. She won't let me.\nCristina: I'm taking care of her.\nMr. Arnold: You're, uh...you're, uh you're looking at my heart? You're looking at my...\nactual heart?\nErica: Better than that, Mr. Arnold, we're fixing it. And, uh, all...all those people, uh, up there in the observation deck, they're...they're, uh, looking at it, too?\nIzzie: They are.\nMr. Arnold: People watching me. People watching me instead of, uh...it's...it's so weird, uh, to be the one being watched. It...it's so weird.\nErica: How you doing there, Mr. Arnold? You need anything?\nMr. Arnold: Uh, uh, it's...it's cold, uh, co-cold in here. Uh, I...I need to cover up. Uh, uh, c-cover me up. Uh, okay? Um, cov-cover me up. C-cov-cover me up.\nIzzie: Yeah, we're gonna...we're...we're gonna cover your legs with more blankets right now.\nMr. Arnold: Oh, c-cov-cover me up. Okay? Okay, cover...cover me up.\nIzzie: His heart rate's up to 168.\nErica: Damn it.\nMr. Arnold: You know, uh, ev-everybody's watching, uh, and...and, uh, I...I need to be covered up. I...I need...I...I can't stay like this. I can't stay like this. You need...need...I...I can' I can't. No, stop right now. Just...just stop the surgery. Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Okay, I...I mean it. Get your hands out of me. Please stop!\nErica: Mr. Arnold, I need you to calm down so that your heart can calm down.\nIzzie: Okay, hey, Mr. Arnold. Mr. Arnold, oh. Look at me. Good. Okay. Now I want you to focus on... on the observation deck, okay? Pretend that it's a tree line or a shoreline or something...something with birds. Those aren't people up there watching you, those are birds...your birds...and you're watching them. So tell me, Mr. Arnold, about the birds. Tell me. Tell me about the birds.\nMr. Arnold: I...I can't.\nIzzie: You can. How about her? That woman in...in the far left? What kind of bird would she be?\nMr. Arnold: Okay, okay, uh, uh, I guess, um, uh, she...she has a long neck. Uh, so she'd...she'd be an ibis, some kind of ibis.\nIzzie: Okay, good. Great. Great. Who's next?\nMr. Arnold: Uh, okay. That one (refers to Cristina), uh, doing...doing that little, uh, dance with her fingers. Um, she's a...she...she's the purple sandpiper. Uh, yeah, those are tough little birds. Those are survivors. And, um, and him (refers to Derek), uh, with the, uh, the...the sad eyes, uh-huh, he would...he's a, uh, a thrush, a black-headed nightingale thrush. And...and the tall one standing there, (refers to Richard), uh, watching over everything, over, uh, everyone...uh uh, he doesn't miss a thing. He's a...a great blue heron. No question.\n(George is in the hallway)\nCallie: Hey, how's, uh, how's, uh, how's your bride? Did she, uh, pull through okay?\nGeorge: Yeah.\nCallie: Please tell me that you let go first. I absolutely cannot handle my bride winning that way. What?\nGeorge: Oh, nothing. Just, uh... I just didn't know if we...we'd ever be able to...talk again.\nCallie: I'm letting go. I have to...let go.\n(Callie walks away and George enters Helena's room)\nFiancé 2: Why didn't you tell anybody you were hurting?\nHelena: You would've made me let go.\nFiancé 2: Hell yeah, I would've.\nHelena: I guess I lost anyway.\nGeorge: No, actually, I let go first.\nHelena: You did?\nGeorge: Someone had to catch you.\nJudge: Here, a 100 grand. Have a nice life.\nHelena: We won. Oh, my god. I can't believe I'm crying over this. We did this. We actually did this.\nFiancé 2: No, sweetie, you did it. This was all you.\n(Meredith is in Rick's room)\nRick: I know this sounds ridiculous, but I'm a little disappointed. I mean, I survived a 12,000-foot freefall, and this is gonna be my only scar?\nMeredith: It goes away.\nRick: The scar?\nMeredith: The feeling. That feeling that you have right now, today, that feeling like you can do anything, that clarity, it goes away. And you go right back to being the coward who can't tell the person you love how you feel. I saw your video.\nRick: You saw the...ok. But you're not gonna let Sally see it, right? You're not gonna let her know what I said?\nMeredith: Like I said...it goes away. It's going away right now. You have to tell her how you feel, right now while you still can.\nRick: She is just so incredible, I mean, at everything she does. She's way out of my league. You don't understand. There is no way that she could possibly feel the same way that...\nMeredith: Well, if she doesn't feel the same way, then you move on. But if you never find out how she feels, then that won't be your only scar.\n(Meredith leaves and Sally enters)\n(Mark and Derek are at Derek's waiting for Richard to arrive)\nMark: He doesn't have any secret fetishes, right? He really...he doesn't strike me as a fetish kind of guy.\n(Richard arrives)\nDerek: Hey, Richard, you gotta tell us what this evening is about. You've been obtuse, it's been fun but, you know, we're getting a little freaked out now. What's a gentlemen's evening?\nRichard: It's an evening with no ladies, just gentlemen.\nMark: That's it?\nRichard: Well, yeah.\n(Erica walks up)\nErica: Pretty boys living in the woods. This is very charming. Or sad. I'm not sure which.\nMark: What happened to no ladies?\nDerek: Yeah.\nRichard: Plans change.\n(Seattle scenes)\n(Lexie and Alex are outside the hospital)\nLexie: What are you doing tonight?\nAlex: As in, uh...\nLexie: What are you doing tonight?\nAlex: Look, uh...I'm not a nice guy. I don't date. I don't call the next day. I...I'm not looking for a relationship 'cause I'm never good at 'em. And honestly, I'm kinda hung up on somebody else. So...the only thing you're ever gonna get from me is s*x. That's it. And, uh, that's never enough for girls like you.\n(Alex walks away)\nMVO: Deep down, everyone wants to believe they can be hard-core.\n(The gentleman's evening is playing Monopoly)\nMVO: But being hard-core isn't just about being tough.\nRichard: Oh, this is just unfair!\nErica: In your face, banker. Park place is mine. Give it up. Come on. Yeah, oh, with a hotel! I think you owe him money.\n(Izzie and George are in bed)\nMVO: It's about acceptance.\nIzzie: George. (Crying) I'm exhausted. Every bone...and every muscle in my body...aches. And I don't think I can do this. I don't...it's not that I don't want to, because I do. I really, really do. It's just that I...I just spent six and a half hours on my feet in surgery, and I can barely hold myself up, and I'm just so tired. this is...this is like a...a rare bird, George. You know, I mean, the first time that we're together since...since we were together, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I don't want to waste it. I don't want to waste it on a night that I'm too exhausted to enjoy it because I want to enjoy our rare bird, George. I need to enjoy our rare bird.\nGeorge: Me, too. I...and oh, my hand is just...oh, it's just killing me from holding that dress. So maybe to...maybe tonight's not the perfect night. Maybe a perfect night is...another night.\nIzzie: Really?\nGeorge: Yeah, yeah. Do you want to maybe, uh...go to sleep?\nIzzie: Yeah. Oh, thanks.\nGeorge: Okay. Did you only shave one of your legs?\nIzzie: I know. I'm sorry.\nGeorge: No, no, I was just wondering. It's cool. It's...it's okay. Sorry. It's...it's...\nIzzie: Oh, my god. I can't do it.\n(Meredith and Cristina are in bed)\nMVO: Sometimes you have to give yourself permission to not be hard-core for once.\nMeredith: Maybe I should take a sleeping pill.\nCristina: Oh, no. Don't do that. You'll just get strung out and turn into a bad afterschool special. We'll just sleep, and...you'll sleep.\nMeredith: I can't stop, Cristina. I just can't stop seeing Derek. And it's not about the s*x. It's not...about the s*x. It's about that moment afterward...when the world stops. It just feels so safe...so safe. I'm not ready to give that up. Does that make me sad and weak and pathetic?\nCristina: A little bit.\nMeredith: What do I do?\nCristina: I don't know.\nMVO: You don't have to be tough every minute of every day. It's okay to let down your guard. In fact, there are moments when it's the best thing you could possibly do\n(Meredith hears noises from outside her room and goes to investigate. She walks out to see Alex and Lexie together)...as long as you choose your moments wisely.\n(She slams the door and goes back inside)\nLexie: Alex, please tell me that you don't live with Meredith Grey.\n(Meredith looks shocked in her room)\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Angel and Darla on the bed kissing and ripping each others clothes off\nAngel: \"You know I would never do that.\" Angel wakes beside Darla and jerks upright in bed.\nAngel: \"Get dressed and get out, because the next time I see you I will have to kill you.\"\nShaman: \"I can not help you. No one can. This is not meant to be known.\"\nDarla rubbing her pregnant belly: \"Well, I guess there's only one thing left to do. Time to go visit daddy.\" Rome 1771 Some rats scurry along an underground sewer tunnel. Angelus runs by. He looks behind him and sees a group of monks carrying torches coming his way. Turns a corner, only to see other torch carrying groups of monks down a couple other branches. Angelus comes up on a sewer grate. He pulls the center grating loose, steps through, then wedges it back in place behind him. As he turns, he stumbles, tumbles down the slanting tunnel, crashes through another grate and lands on the floor of some underground chamber lit by torches. He is surrounded by monks with crossbows aimed at him. A pair of double doors swing open behind him, letting in bright sunlight. Angelus throws himself to the ground out of the direct light surrounded by a thin cloud of smoke. A rider brings his horse to a stop just inside the doors and dismounts. One of the monks leads the horse away as the rider makes his way over to a red robbed priest, while Angelus is picks himself up from the floor.\nHoltz: \"Mille grazie, Monsignore. Sono nel vostro debito.\"\nSubtitles: \"Thank you, Monsignor. I am in your debt.\"\nMonsignor (st): \"No, this animal murdered your family. (Points at Angelus) Hold the beast!\" Chains wrap around Angelus upper arms and chest.\nHoltz steps closer to Angelus: \"Monsignor Rivalli, performed the ceremony when Caroline and I were wed. You remember Caroline?\"\nAngelus: \"Pretty lass. Hearty screamer.\"\nHoltz: \"The good monsignor has since then been excommunicated. The order he founded, Inquisitore, adheres to the old beliefs. They're traditionalists and quite good at their work. Let's get started, shall we?\" Holtz takes a sharp hook and some knives from one of the monks. We see the hook digging into the side of Angelus' neck, hear some cloth ripping.\nAngelus: \"Ah. Aah!\" We see the sun rise and set while hearing Angelus' screams in the background. The monsignor is walking cross the room, reading a book. Holtz is sitting on a bench, drinking from a cup. We hear some monks recite in the background and Angelus gasping in pain.\nHoltz: \"You lost me in North Africa. I knew you'd come back to Europe, but *Rome* Angelus? (Gets up and walks around Angelus, suspended from the ceiling by chains around his wrists) Why in Gods name would you come to the seat of all that's holy?\"\nAngelus: \"Darla - she loves the Sistine chapel.\"\nHoltz: \"Michelangelo?\"\nAngelus: \"Not him. She's mad about Botticelli's frescos. (Groans) The Temptation of Christ is her favorite - probably because of the leper. (Sighs) What do you want, Holtz?\" Holtz picks up a three-pronged claw and looks at it.\nHoltz: \"I don't want anything. My family is gone. I don't trust you to give me Darla, although I *will* find her, you know that. My only desire here - is to discover if a thing such as yourself can be made to pay for its sins. (Holtz digs the claw-thingy in somewhere below Angelus waist (off screen) and Angelus groans in pain) You're a demon. It is your nature to maim and kill. But you were also once a man. If we beat and burn the demon out of your living flesh, will there be anything left? (Holtz digs the claw in again and Angelus groans in pain) Anything at all? I doubt it. But I'm willing to spend the next fortnight of my life finding out. - In either event - you have no soul, you can not be saved.\" A flaming arrow streaks across the room and buries itself in one of the monks.\nDarla: \"Sorry it took me so long darling.\" Darla is standing in a tunnel opening, holding a crossbow loaded with another flaming arrow. There are other vampires with her.\nDarla: \"Kill them.\" Darla fires her flaming bolt, hitting Holtz in the shoulder. The vampires streak past her and attack the monks. Several vampires get staked by the monks during the fight, but that doesn't slow the rest of them down. Monsignor confronts Darla with a cross held in front of him.\nMonsignor: \"Vai' all inferno, demonio lordo! (caption) Go to hell foul demon!\" Darla pushes the cross aside, then sends the Monsignor flying into a wall.\nDarla: \"No, grazie, padre.\" The double doors that Holtz rode in through is pulled down and a horse and carriage driven by a blanket shrouded vampire trot in. Darla unclips Angelus chains. Two other vampires catch him under the arms and drop him onto the back of the cart. Holtz tries to get up. Darla knocks him across the chin, then joins a groaning Angelus on the cart.\nAngelus: \"Darlin'?\"\nDarla: \"What?\"\nAngelus: \"Shouldn't we be killing Holtz?\"\nDarla: \"I know, but it's just so much fun ruining his life. He's like family now.\" Angelus pulls Darla into a kiss as a vampire covers them with a tarp. The wagon heads out into the sunlight, with the blanket shrouded vamp at the reins. A public bus (Downtown LA - Hollywood) pulls over to the side of a dark and deserted street in LA.\nDarla: \"Right here is fine. (To bus driver) Thanks for the lift. That didn't take long at all. (Gets off the bus) And they say there is no public transportation in LA.\" The bus driver turns slowly and looks towards the back of the bus. Three passengers are slumped in their seats with twin puncture wounds visible on their necks. Four other people are huddled down in the back of the bus. Bus driver fumbles out his radio: \"Help! We got a code twelve on the 5-8 line! We need help here now, for god's sake. Now!\" Darla walks away across the street. Intro Cordy is arranging some flowers in a vase down in the basement of the Hyperion. Angel walks into the training area and sees that there are several vases of them scattered around the room.\nAngel: \"What's this?\"\nCordy: \"Oh, it's just so dark and lifeless down here, I thought I'd brighten it up a little for you. (Angel picks up one of the vases) You can't exactly go out and enjoy the sunny fields of nature, but that doesn't mean we can't bring a little bloom into your darkness.\"\nAngel: \"They're fake.\"\nCordy: \"Yeah. You put something real in this hellhole and it die (snaps her fingers) like that.\" Angel puts the flowers down, looking at Cordy.\nCordy: \"Thank you, Cordelia?\"\nAngel: \"You know, I've been around a long time...\"\nCordy: \"Which reminds me. Next birthday, you think we could skip the two-hundred and fifty odd candles on the cake and the inevitable fire marshal and just go and just go with a little song?\"\nAngel: \"And I've never known anyone like you.\"\nCordy: \"Well, duh! Times a wasting, big guy. Can we do it? (Takes on a stance) Hi-yeah!\"\nAngel chuckling: \"Okay. Last time we were working on not pulling your punches and your kicks. Right? Don't worry about me. (Cordy hits him and he deflects the punch with his arm) That's good. (Cordy swipes at him again) Good! Where is your weight? (Angel looks down) Balls of your feet?\" Cordy swings and hits him across the face full force.\nCordy: \"Oops! Oh god, you said that... (Angel straightens back up, smiling) Are you okay?\"\nAngel: \"I'm a vampire. You can't hurt me. Good.\" Angel turns away from her and makes a face, gingerly feeling his nose.\nCordy: \"You're off your game. It's because of the prophecy Wes and Gunn are trying to get their hands on. You think the end is coming.\" Angel turns back to face her: \"The end is not coming. Someone is always uncovering some ancient scroll, and they're always saying the same thing: that something terrible is coming. Do you know how many of these things I've seen in my very long life?\"\nCordy: \"Four?\"\nAngel: \"Three. But there's nothing to worry about.\"\nCordy: \"Then way are Gunn and Wesley breaking and entering right now?\"\nAngel: \"Breaking and entering is such a negative term. They are simply retrieving some missing pieces from the Nyazian Scroll. Just to make sure...\"\nCordy: \"That the end is coming. - Well, all we can do is live each moment to the fullest and be grateful that we didn't throw too much money at the NASDAQ.\" Angel blinking his eyes and lifting a hand towards his face: \"Am I swelling?\" Camera sweeps over some big houses, surrounded by big gardens on a sunny plateau with some mountains in the background. Pans past some old oil paintings and statuary to show Wes, dressed in black, sneaking up on the window and look into the window from outside. Wes motions and Gunn walks up beside him.\nWes: \"Step one: Dobermans are happily gnawing on the steak. Alarm and vid lines are disabled (pulls out a scanner and looks at its display) no infrared. Caught a break there. Step two: we cut a hole in the glass, snake in the mini-cam and scan the interior.\" Gunn walks over to look in the glass door while Wes pulls glasscutter with a suction cup out of his duffel bag and attaches it to the window.\nWes: \"If it's all clear, we disable the locks and bolts on the side door thus completing... (Gunn tries the door and it swings open) ...step three.\" Wes closes up his duffel and moves over to follow Gunn inside, then hurries back to detach the suction cup from the window and stow it in his bag while Gunn waits for him inside. Wes hurries in and motions for Gunn to close the patio door. They open the doors into an adjacent room, in which all sorts of things are on display. Gunn looks around and whistles.\nWes: \"Can you believe this?\"\nGunn looking around: \"Some guys collect old cars, some guys collect...\" Gunn flinches back as he spots a misshapen, one-eyed demon head in a glass case. Then he and Wes lean in for a closer look.\nGunn: \"It's like - the eye follows you wherever you go.\" Wes walks over to a bottle sitting on a pedestal, pulls out the stopper and takes a sniff before closing it again.\nWes: \"Alright. If you were the priceless remnants of the lost Nyazian Scroll, where would you be?\"\nGunn: \"If I was priceless - I'd be in the vault.\"\nWes: \"The vault? Your snitch never said anything about a vault!\"\nGunn: \"I got a bad feeling about this.\"\nWes: \"We figure something out. It's just a - vault.\"\nGunn: \"Actually my bad feeling is more about the man standing behind you with the large revolver.\" Wes turns to see a guy standing in the door aiming a gun at them.\nMan: \"Move and I'll kill you. The man edges into the room and reaches for the telephone with one hand while still aiming the gun at them with the other.\nWes: \"I hope you're calling the police.\"\nMan: \"You bet I am.\"\nWes: \"Good. You can explain to them why you keep so much GHB on hand. (Wes walks over to the bottle on the pedestal) You know, Rohypnol, the date rape drug.\"\nMan: \"What?\"\nWes indicates the bottle: \"Muslok Trancing Amalgam. Under the microscope it's virtually indistinguishable from GHB.\" The man slowly puts the receiver back down.\nMan: \"Alright. I won't call the police.\"\nWes: \"I'm glad we understand each other.\"\nMan: \"Until after I kill you.\"\nWes: \"Oh.\" Gunn picks up four red glass balls out of a bowl on another stand.\nGunn: \"Hey, these worth a lot?\"\nMan: \"Yes. They're Cyopian conjuring spheres.\"\nGunn: \"How much? Four figures each? Five? (Starts to juggle two of the balls with one hand) More?\"\nMan: \"Stop that!\"\nGunn: \"Put the weapon down.\" When the man hesitates, Gunn lets one of the balls drop and it shatters with a liquid splash as it hits the floor.\nGunn: \"Kind of delicate. (Juggles the remaining three with both hands) Look, we're not thieves, we're investigators. Now, we need to look at your Nyazian Scrolls. Put the weapon down, because - I'm getting kind of tired here.\"\nMan: \"Alright!\" Man puts the revolver down on a glass case and Wes retrieves it. Gunn drops another ball (the owner lets out a fearful gasp) only to bounce it off his foot and catch it again.\nGunn: \"I always wanna give them a big finish. Fred comes down the basement stairs of the Hyperion.\nCordy: \"Ow. That doesn't feel right.\"\nAngel: \"Just relax. You have to bend.\"\nCordy: \"I don't bend there. - Okay. Now that's downright unnatural.\"\nAngel: \"I know it feels strange, but if an attacker comes at you from behind, you wanna be able to shift all your weight immediately to your other foot so you can spin and kick. Here, you try it.\" Cordy spins and kicks up against Angel's chest. Angel catches her, one arm around her leg another around her waist to keep her from falling.\nAngel: \"Whoa! Easy. Alright. That's alright. (Lowers her leg and lets go of her) That's better. We'll keep - working on it. Okay. That's probably enough for today.\"\nCordy: \"Yeah, well, we could do more of it, but then I'd have to ice every bone in my body. See you.\" Cordy walks towards the stairs, one hand pressed against the small of her back.\nCordy: \"Hey, Fred.\"\nFred: \"Hey! - Kye-rumption.\"\nCordy walking up the stairs: \"Well - back at you.\"\nAngel: \"What did you say?\"\nFred: \"Kye-rumption. It's the one nice word I remember from the Pylean hell dimension.\"\nAngel: \"What's it mean?\"\nFred: \"It's when two great heroes meet on the field of battle and recognize their mutual fate. It's also a kind of grog made out of the ox dung but that's archaic.\"\nAngel: \"Oh, ah, that's interesting.\"\nFred: \"When I see you and Cordelia sparring Kye-rumption always comes to mind.\"\nAngel after a beat: \"Me and Cordelia.\"\nFred: \"I know. She's such a hero, with the visions and the courage. It's only natural that you and she would be drawn to one another. - Oh! Plastic flowers! (Hurries over to one of the vases) My favorite! They never fade, you know.\"\nAngel: \"Oh, whoa, wait a minute. There's nothing going on between me and Cordelia.\"\nFred: \"Nothing but Moira.\"\nAngel: \"Who's Moira?\"\nFred: \"Moira is the gut physical attraction between two larger than life souls.\"\nAngel: \"Ha. No, there is no attraction. Cordelia is a friend. Someone I work with. That's all.\"\nFred grinning: \"See? You're being chivalrous. Because you 're a hero, just like her. You got Kye-rumption!\"\nAngel: \"Stop using that word!\"\nWes: \"What's going on down here?\"\nAngel: \"Nothing.\"\nWes: \"I believe Fred's been through enough recently without people shouting at her.\"\nFred: \"He didn't mean anything by it.\" Wes just stands there, looking at the floor.\nAngel: \"Is there something you wanted?\"\nWes: \"Yes. (Looks at Fred) Gunn and I were hoping you could give us a hand with the Nyazian Prohecies. We need someone who can do the math.\"\nFred: \"Sure!\" Fred starts up the stairs.\nWes looks around: \"Who gave you all the flowers?\"\nAngel: \"Nobody.\" Gunn is throwing darts at a board in the office at the Hyperion. Wes is sitting at the desk, writing. Fred is sitting beside him, working on the laptop. Cordy is at her own desk.\nGunn: \"So, how are you doing there, Fred?\"\nFred: \"Oh, it's a simple equation, really. The ancient Roman calendar has fourteen hundred and sixty-four days in a four-year cycle. The Etruscan, Sumerian, and Druidian each have their own cycles. You work forward from the presumed day of the prophecy under each calendar, factoring in our own three hundred and sixty-five day calendar and accounting for a three day discrepancy for every four years and...\" Angel walks into the lobby, he sees Cordy sitting at her desk and stops before anyone notices he's there.\nFred: \"Oh. - That can't be right. - Unless the world ended last March.\"\nGunn: \"So, are we talking Armageddon - or bad house number? (Sits down in the chair in front of Wes desk) Is it a bad event - or a bad guy?\"\nWes: \"It's not clear on that. It predicts the arrival or arising of the Tro-clan, the person or being that brings about the ruination of mankind.\"\nGunn: \"So it's a two for one. Isn't that nice.\"\nWes: \"And I'm not sure on the translation. Ruination may in fact mean purification.\"\nGunn: \"Purification? So this Tro-clan is a good thing?\"\nWes: \"I doubt that. But it's purification in Aramaic, ruination in ancient Greek and in the lost Ga-shundi language it means both.\"\nCordy: \"And you don't want to make the same mistake twice.\" Cordy looks up from her desk at Wes, who looks down at his papers.\nWes: \"No.\"\nFred: \"What mistake?\"\nWes: \"There was another prophecy a while back. It seemed to be about Angel and contained the word 'Shanshu' which I thought meant to die and I - sort of told Angel...\"\nCordy: \"...that we was going to die.\"\nFred: \"Oh, no.\"\nWes: \"Then I found out it also meant to live. It meant to die and to live.\"\nFred: \"So - which is it?\"\nWes: \"Both. In his case it meant that some day the vampire in him might die, but the human in him might live.\" Angel is standing at a corner in the lobby, listening.\nFred: \"That he would be like a normal man?\" Angel slowly lifts his head and looks at Cordy working at her desk.\nWes: \"Yes.\"\nFred: \"Wow. What would we do if that happened?\"\nCordy: \"I'd buy him some plaid shirts and take him to the beach. The boy needs some color.\" Fred goes back to typing on the laptop.\nFred: \"There. That came out better. - Oh. No it didn't. It's still very preliminary, but - if these calculations are correct, this bad thing should already be here. (Looks around) Well, I-I guess not right here, but - here in LA.\" Angel walks into the reception area and sits down.\nFred: \"Let me run these numbers again.\"\nCordy: \"Hey.\"\nAngel: \"Hey.\"\nCordy after a while: \"Why are you looking at me like that?\"\nAngel: \"Ah, no reason.\" After a moment Cordy gets up and walks past Angel to pour a cup of coffee.\nCordy: \"Okay. It's getting creepy now.\"\nAngel: \"I was just thinking about things. - People. You know. How they relate. Take you and me for instance. We're very different. *Very* different. Obviously (points at Cordy) human (points at himself) vampire. (points a Cordy) Woman (points at himself) man...pire.\"\nCordy: \"Has someone been putting vodka in your blood?\"\nAngel laughs: \"See? You're funny! And I, well I get off a good one every once in a while, but you...\"\nCordy, sipping her coffee: \"Angel, are you trying to say you love me?\"\nAngel: \"What?\"\nCordy: \"I love you too.\"\nAngel: \"You do? When did this...\" Cordy yells towards Wes open office door: \"Angel loves me. I love him.\"\nAngel: \"Oh, my god!\"\nCordy: \"You guys love us and we love you.\"\nFred, Wes and Gunn chorus: \"We love you Angel.\"\nCordy: \"They were all saying it earlier. Just in case this prophecy comes true and we all die. - You're not gonna wanna hug, are you?\" Angel clears his throat and sits back shaking his head: \"No.\" Cordy goes back to her desk: \"God knows we've been through a lot together.\"\nAngel: \"That's really all I was trying to say, that we've been through so much together, you and me, as *friends.* You've seen the - good, - and the not so good.\"\nCordy: \"Just like you have in me. And for the record: the good I've seen far outweighs the bad.\"\nAngel after a beat: \"Thanks. You, too.\"\nCordy: \"Hey, what are friends for?\"\nDarla: \"If you ask me, they're for knocking you up and leaving you high and dry.\" Angel spins around to see a very pregnant Darla standing on the top landing leading down into the lobby from outside.\nDarla: \"Hello, lover. Long time no see.\" Break\nAngel: \"Darla.\"\nCordy: \"Darla?\"\nWes: \"Darla!\"\nFred: \"Who's Darla?\"\nGunn: \"Angel's old flame from way back.\"\nFred: \"Not the one that died?\"\nGunn: \"Yeah. No, not that one. The other one that died and came back to life. She's a vampire.\"\nFred: \"Y'all have a chart or something?\"\nGunn: \"In the files. I'll get it for you later.\"\nAngel: \"Well, when did this happen?\"\nDarla comes down the steps: \"You know *exactly* when it happened.\"\nCordy: \"Angel - did - you and Darla...?\"\nAngel: \"Uh...\" Cordy turns to look at him.\nAngel: \"This is impossible.\"\nDarla: \"Tell me about it - daddy!\"\nCordy: \"You slept with her?\"\nAngel: \"Vampires can't have children. Wesley?\"\nWes: \"Ah, no, he's right. It's not possible.\"\nCordy: \"That's not what I asked.\"\nDarla: \"You know we can't. I know we can't. But - we did.\"\nFred: \"I wonder if this might not be that bad thing we were expecting.\"\nDarla: \"What did you do to me?\" She hits Angel across the face and he stumbles back against the weapons cabinet behind him. Cordy steps between Angel and Darla: \"Stop that!\"\nAngel: \"It's okay. It's alright. I'm okay.\"\nCordy: \"You'll hurt her! Haven't you done enough? (Turns to Darla) Here, sit down. You should get off your feet.\" Cordy leads Darla over to the round settee, then looks back at the others.\nCordy: \"Can we get her some water?\" Fred turns to go get it.\nAngel: \"Cordy that's *Darla.* Maybe you don't want to...\"\nCordy: \"Did you or did you not look me in the eye and say that you would *never* do a thing like this with her?\"\nDarla: \"Oh, he lied? What a surprise.\" Fred carrying a glass of water: \"Hi. I'm Fred. Is water okay, or did you want some blood?\" Darla takes the water as Wes gently pulls Fred back away from Darla.\nAngel: \"Cordy. I'm sorry - I lied. It was just - it was a very dark time.\"\nCordy: \"Oh! You used her to make *you* feel better during *your* dark time. Well, that makes it *all* heroic.\"\nAngel: \"It wasn't like that. It just - happened. It wasn't like I went *evil* or anything, I just...\"\nCordy: \"You just went male. (brushes the hair out of Darla's face) Have you been to a doctor.\"\nDarla gives her a look: \"No. But I have been to every shaman and seer in the Western Hemisphere.\"\nWes: \"And what did they say?\"\nDarla: \"They don't know what it is. They don't know what it means. Nothing like this has ever happened.\"\nAngel: \"Maybe it's an hysterical pregnancy.\"\nDarla: \"You wanna feel it kick?\"\nCordy: \"Does it kick a lot?\"\nDarla: \"Like crazy.\"\nAngel: \"well, now wouldn't that be the first sign of... (Cordy gives him a look) ...hysteria?\"\nCordy: \"What can we do for you?\"\nDarla: \"Well, you can get you little gang of supernatural detectives to find out what the hell is happening to me and how to stop it.\"\nCordy looking at Darla: \"Are you gonna take some responsibility here? (Looks up at Angel) Angel?\"\nAngel: \"Oh, me? - Of course I am. - Wes, lets get on this right now.\"\nWes: \"What do you suggest?\"\nAngel: \"I suggest you use your books and find out what's going on. What, do I have to think of everything?\" Wes picks up a book from the counter and opens it.\nWes: \"Oh, here it is.\" Darla straightens up in her seat and Angel walks over to Wes.\nWes: \"It says 'I have absolutely no idea what's going on.' (Closes the book) We should talk to the host.\"\nLorne: \"Oh, this is all wrong.\" The camera pulls back and we see that he is looking at two people holding up a modern painting.\nLorne: \"Try it on the back wall. Far away from where folks might be eating.\"\nMuses: \"Violence abounds, violence restrain, this space a sanctuary was and shall be again.\"\nLorne: \"That's great girls. - Hey, Arnie, why 're you charging me twelve hundred over the estimate here?\"\nArnie: \"Had to run a separate two twelve to the security box. Double insulation everywhere in the building. Plus, we had a run on Kek bile and Bin-der glands. And you know what you said: 'This club's my baby. I want top drawer through out.\"\nAngel: \"Lorne! You here? - You got to help me. We got (looks back at the others filing in behind him) kind of a situation on our hands.\"\nMuses: \"Mmm, Angel.\"\nCordy: \"And here we have three more of Angel's chippies. You girls are on the pill I hope.\"\nMuses: \"Mmm.\" Angel smiles and waves at them then walks over to lean in close to Lorne.\nAngel: \"What are they doing here?\"\nLorne: \"They're here to help recast the sanctuary spell to prevent violence in the club. And this time I'm covering demons *and* humans. I'm opening the club again. I know I was blue for a pretty long time. If it'd gone on much longer I would have turned aquamarine. (Lorne is the only one laughing) And now that the ice is broken (turns to Darla) what happened here?\"\nDarla: \"What's it look like?\"\nCordy: \"Angel boned her.\"\nAngel: \"Just once. Just the one night. Ah, just the two or three one times that one night...\"\nFred: \"Is Angel gonna sing?\"\nGunn: \"Oh!\"\nWes: \"I suppose he has to.\"\nCordy: \"She's carrying the baby!\" Darla grabs Lorne by the lapels, pulls herself in close and starts to sing: \"Oh, Danny boy... What the hell's inside me?\"\nLorne: \"Oh, no, no, no. We're way past singing, mes enfants. This is a brand new day here. (To the club at large) Alright every body, that's a wrap! (People and demons start filing out) We'll finish the spell tomorrow. We got a little crisis brewing. Thanks for coming! Check's in the mail! Get the hell out.\"\nMuses, speaking in turn: \"Bye Angel, come see us soon. Mmm...\"\nCordy: \"Men!\"\nLorne: \"This is way beyond my ken - and my Barbie and *all* my action figures. If it's alive...\"\nDarla: \"Oh, it's alive! And kicking!\"\nLorne: \"It could be anything. A child born to two vampires...\"\nGunn: \"Maybe it's some kind of 'ueber'- vamp.\"\nWes: \"The Nyazian prophecies mention a Tro-clan.\"\nFred: \"That's supposed to be here about now.\"\nLorne: \"Born out of darkness to bring darkness.\"\nAngel: \"Great. So, we're saying that my child is - the scourge of mankind?\" Darla moans.\nCordy: \"You guys are upsetting her! (To Lorne) I think she needs to lie down.\"\nLorne: \"Yeah, of course. She can have my bedroom.\" Lorne and Cordy help Darla up and start to lead her towards the back of the club. When Angel starts to follow Cordy stops him.\nCordy: \"We can handle it.\" Cordy and Lorne lead Darla into Lorne's bedroom.\nCordy: \"I think we should call a doctor.\"\nDarla: \"It'll pass. I just have to - let it.\" Darla lets herself drop onto the bed and Cordy sits down on the edge of it beside her.\nCordy: \"I'll stay with her.\"\nLorne: \"If you need anything, just holler.\"\nCordy: \"Okay.\" Lorne leaves the room.\nAngel: \"I don't accept this. These stupid prophecies, you can always interpret them a hundred ways from Sunday. How do we even know your calculations are correct?\"\nFred: \"I don't. I'm still working on them.\"\nGunn: \"Well, we do know that Darla is pregnant with something!\"\nAngel: \"That's biologically impossible.\"\nLorne: \"And mystically unfair. You've fought long and hard for good. If your destiny is to spawn something evil...\"\nAngel: \"I don't see how anything spawned by Darla and me could be good.\"\nWes: \"You know the first prophecy that said that the vampire with a soul would be pivotal in the battle between good and evil?\"\nGunn: \"That Shanshu one?\"\nWes: \"Maybe it's not you. Maybe your child is a pivotal figure. Maybe your destiny is simply to help bring to the world.\"\nAngel after a beat: \"Or to stop it.\"\nFred: \"Can I say something about destiny?- Screw destiny! If this evil thing comes we'll fight it, and we'll keep fighting it until we whoop it. 'cause destiny is just another word for inevitable and nothing's inevitable as long as you stand up, look it in the eye, and say 'your evitable!' - Well, you- you catch my drift.\"\nLorne: \"Wow. I like her so much!\"\nAngel: \"I wanna see these prophecies myself, and your calculations, Fred, and anything else we got on this.\"\nFred: \"Why don't I go back to the hotel and get everything?\"\nWes: \"Good idea. We put our heads together and figure out a way to fight this thing.\" Fred leaves and Angel turns to Lorne.\nAngel: \"How's she doing?\"\nLorne: \"Well, she's weary. The poor thing looks like she's about eighteen months pregnant. Hope they're not twins.\"\nAngel: \"Not her. Cordelia.\"\nLorne: \"Oh, ah, I sense that she's - hurt and *pissed* what with the lying and deception and ecetera. You should probably stay out of her way for a while, huh?\"\nCordy: \"How're you feeling?\"\nDarla: \"Just crazy.\"\nCordy: \"What?\"\nDarla: \"Why would anyone bring something into this world?\"\nCordy: \"I was pregnant once. (Laughs and holds out a hand) I was out to here - overnight! Mystical thing. I didn't go to term, but while it lasted, hooh! Talk about uncomfortable! Your back and legs hurt all the time and first you're sick to your stomach and you can't eat anything and then your ravenous! Are you able to eat or do you just...\"\nDarla levers herself up: \"What? Drink?\"\nCordy: \"Well, it's - really none of my business, is it? - You should rest (Cordy gets up) and I should (starts to walk towards the door) I'll just be real close by. If there is anything that you need... (Darla morphs into vampface) Anything at all...\" Cordy is about to open the door, but Darla is suddenly there, holding the door shut.\nDarla: \"I'm hungry all the time. It's weird.\"\nCordy: \"Sure. You're eating for two now. It's only natural.\"\nDarla: \"No, what's weird is - no matter how much I feed - I can't seem to get full.\" Cordy punches Darla hard across the face. Follows it up with a second punch, then pulls out a cross to ward Darla off.\nCordy: \"Pregnant or not, you're *going* to keep your distance.\" Darla bats the cross aside, grabs Cordy and throws her across the room against a table. Then she clamps a hand over Cordy's mouth to prevent her from screaming and sinks her teeth into the side of Cordy's neck. Break\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAs Darla bites her, Cordy gets hit by a vision. Darla backs away from her for a moment while we see flashes of some arcade, then lunges back in - only to get pulled back away by Angel.\nAngel: \"Get away from her!\" Angel picks Cordy up and carries over to the bed.\nAngel: \"You're gonna be alright. You're gonna be alright.\" Cordy holding the side of her neck: \"Ouch!\" Angel presses a cloth over the neck wound.\nAngel: \"Cordy, you're gonna be all right. I'll kill her for this.\"\nCordy panting: \"You're gonna have to find her first.\" Angel looks around. Darla is gone. Out in the club the others are just picking themselves back up, when Angel comes out, carrying Cordy in his arms.\nAngel: \"She bit Cordy.\"\nLorne: \"Oh, sweetie, are you alright?\"\nAngel: \"No. Where is she?\"\nWes: \"She got away.\"\nGunn: \"We tried to stop her by hitting her fists and feet with our faces, but...\"\nAngel: \"We'll take Cordy to a safe place and we'll take care of Darla.\" Hyperion, night, Cordy is lying on a bed with Angel sitting beside her.\nAngel: \"Are you feeling any better?\"\nCordy: \"Yeah. You don't have to stay with me.\"\nAngel: \"Gunn's gonna be right here.\" Cordy lifts her head to look at Gunn: \"Thanks.\"\nAngel: \"I'm not gonna keep telling you how sorry I am. I'm gonna tell you - that she'll never do it again.\"\nCordy: \"It was my fault, Angel. I felt sorry for her. She looked so helpless - like a mother. - I forgot what she really was. - I'm starting to feel the pills.\" Angel gets up and backs away from the bed as Cordy's eyes drift closed.\nAngel quietly to Gunn: \"You see Darla anywhere in range...\"\nGunn: \"I'll take care of it.\" Angel turns to go.\nCordy sits up: \"Wait! - When she bit me I had a vision. I almost forgot.\" Angel comes back and sits back down on the edge of the bed.\nAngel: \"What did you see?\"\nCordy: \"It was like no vision I ever had before. - She's so hungry. - She doesn't know how to make the hunger stop. - I think I know where she's headed.\" Angel is arming himself from the weapons cabinet.\nWes: \"I'm not speaking to you as the boss, because I know you wouldn't listen, but you shouldn't do this alone.\"\nAngel: \"I *have* to do this alone.\"\nWes: \"Angel, a normal vampire is strong, and Darla wasn't normal before this. She took down the host, Gunn, and me without even breaking stride. She's stronger than all of us right now, including you, because of what's in her.\"\nAngel: \"I know. I put it there.\" Angel turns away and hurries out.\nWes: \"Why does he think he has to do everything alone?\"\nFred: \"I think he just can't bear to have us see him do it.\"\nWes: \"Kill Darla? She did try to kill Cordy - and she's a vampire.\"\nFred: \"Who is carrying his child. The one thing he can never have, even if he lives forever.\" A busy arcade, there are kids and noise everywhere. A little blond boy stands in the middle of the confusion, looking around.\nBoy: \"Mommy? - Mommy? - Mommy?\"\nDarla: \"What's wrong, honey? Lost your mommy? (Boy nods) Let's go find her together, hm?\" The boy nods and takes her hand. Darla turns to lead him away.\nWoman: \"You're a brave woman! (Darla stops and looks over her shoulder) About to have one, taking another one out to play.\"\nDarla: \"Oh. I love children. I could just - eat them up.\" Darla and the woman smile at each other and go their separate ways. Break Cordy is sleeping on the bed, dreaming of Darla biting her and getting the vision. She jerks awake with a gasp. Gunn comes over and sits down on the edge of the bed.\nGunn: \"Hey, hey! It's alright. It's just a dream, okay? I'm right here. She can't hurt you.\"\nCordy: \"I have to talk to Wes.\" Cordy is pacing in Wes' office.\nCordy: \"It was a dream, but - it was more like a vision.\"\nWes: \"About what?\"\nCordy: \"About what's inside Darla. (Sits down) This Tro-clan thing - the prophecies say that it will be born - or it will arise?\"\nWes: \"It says both. The middle English eyrizan and the Gothic urreisan, both mean to appear, to spring up.\"\nFred: \"Angel's not answering his phone. Should I leave a message on his voice mail?\"\nCordy: \"He doesn't know how to use his voice mail. Just try his pager.\"\nWes: \"There is also a reference to the Tro-clan being boren, which is pretty plain middle English for being born, to bear.\" We hear a pager go off. Gunn checks his belt, then gets up and walks over and pulls Angel's pager out of the pocket of the coat hanging in the corner of Wes' office.\nGunn: \"Well, we found Angel's beeper.\"\nWes: \"What is it, Cordy? What is the vision trying to tell you?\"\nCordy: \"I think they're trying to tell me *why* Darla is craving younger victims.\" Darla is crouched in front of the little boy in a deserted corner of the arcade.\nBoy: \"Ma'am, I don't think my mom is back here.\"\nDarla: \"Are you sure? Did you look?\" The boy looks around.\nBoy: \"I don't see anybody.\" He turns back to see that Darla has morphed and lets out a scream. Angel runs across some of the arcade games and tackles Darla against the wall and slams the stake in his hand towards her heart. Darla puts up a hand to ward it off the stake pierces her hand until it comes out on the other side. The boy runs away screaming, straight into his mother's arms out in the crowd.\nMother: \"There you are! (Catches him up in her arms and hugs him close) Where have you been? How many times have I told you not to wander off!\" Darla tosses Angel out from the deserted section. The mother's eyes widen as Angel lands on top of some tables, over turning them. People in the crowd see Darla follow him out, still wearing her vampface and turn to run away, screaming. Darla pulls the stake out of her right palm and lets it drop as she walks towards Angel.\nDarla: \"You *so* want to play the good guy, don't you? Yeah. You're the good guy who did *this* to me.\" Hauls back and knocks Angel across the face, slamming him against one of the games.\nDarla: \"You may have the face, but you don't know the hunger! It pounds! You can't make it go away! You can't stop it!\"\nAngel: \"I'll stop it!\" He hauls back and hits Darla. The two of them fight. In the end Angel manages to grab Darla by the throat and push her up against the wall.\nDarla: \"How could you put this in me? I *hate* you!\" Darla hits him again, but Angel refuses to let go of her throat.\nDarla: \"They breathe. They breathe and pound. I don't breathe, you idiot! You can't strangle me!\" Darla laughs.\nAngel: \"I'm not gonna strangle you.\" Angel pulls her away and slams her back up against the wall, pulling out another stake.\nDarla: \"Come on! Do it! (Angel hesitates) Do it!\" Angel slowly lowers the stake and looks down at Darla's belly. We hear a heartbeat. Angel slowly steps back from Darla. Darla lunges, grabs a hold of Angel's jacket and shakes him.\nDarla: \"Do it! Do it! Make it stop!\" Angel gently restrains her, wrapping her tightly in his arms and pulling her up against his chest.\nAngel: \"No it won't, Darla. Darla, listen to me.\"\nDarla: \"Make it stop! Make it stop.\"\nAngel: \"The child. The child has a heartbeat. It has a soul.\"\nDarla flailing wildly: \"No! Not my child! No!\"\nAngel: \"Our child. Ourchild. Our child. That's why you've been craving purer and purer blood. That's why it's been driving you out of your mind. It has a soul.\" Darla collapses against Angel's chest, sobbing: \"No, it doesn't.\"\nAngel holding her: \"It does.\"\nDarla: \"It can't.\"\nAngel quietly: \"Yes, it does. It does.\" Angel helps Darla to lay back down on a bed in the Hyperion and hands her a mug.\nAngel: \"Here, drink this.\" Darla takes a gulp then makes face.\nDarla: \"Pig's blood?\"\nAngel: \"You need to keep yourself nourished. You'll get used...\" Darla throws the pug against the wall, shattering it and splashing the wall with blood.\nAngel: \"You're not alone in this anymore. We'll deal with this together.\"\nDarla: \"Gosh. I'm the luckiest vampire girl in the whole world. - Get away from me.\"\nAngel gets up: \"Try and get some sleep.\"\nDarla: \"How's Cordy? She wanna come up and visit?\" Laughs. Angel walks up to Gunn, standing in the door holding a loaded crossbow.\nAngel: \"She goes near Cordy, or Fred...\"\nGunn lifting the bow: \"I know.\"\nAngel: \"Don't underestimate her. The woman is stronger than all of us right now.\" Angel walks down into the lobby and sees Cordy and Wes leaning over an open book on the reception counter together.\nAngel: \"You're not to go near Darla for any reason without me, Gunn, and a lot of crossbows standing between you. You understand?\"\nCordy: \"Oh, yeah. And if I forget (indicates the bandage on the side of her neck) I have a nice little reminder.\"\nAngel: \"That goes for you, too, Fred.\" Fred looks up from the laptop: \"Gotcha.\" Angel goes to sit down on the settee in the middle of the lobby and Cordy walks over to him.\nCordy: \"So, I guess you're gonna be a father.\"\nAngel after a beat: \"Guess I am.\"\nCordy: \"I felt it in my dream. The same thing you did - when you found her. (Sits down beside him) It has a soul.\"\nWes: \"Well, Angel has a soul. It makes sense. As much as any of this does.\" Angel looks down at his folded hands.\nWes: \"Angel, even with a soul, she could give birth to what's spoken of in the prophecies.\"\nAngel looks at Wes: \"The thing that's coming to kill and burn us all? - I know that. - I also know the child is mine.\"\nWes: \"Right.\"\nCordy: \"Well! Another big fun day at Angel Investigations. (Gets up) What do you say we pour ourselves a good stiff...\"\nFred: \"Uh-oh.\"\nCordy: \"A good, stiff uh-oh?\"\nFred: \"Remember before when I said I thought that maybe, possibly, perhaps I might have been off in my earlier calculations? And you asked Wes if he thought if the Tro-clan was prophesied to arise or be born and he said it could be both? And we all know that the Latin for arrive is arripare, to come to land or possibly in this instance simply to come to, as from a deep sleep?\"\nAngel, Wes: \"Fred!\"\nFred: \"Right. I believe that whatever this thing is, it's arriving right about (looks down at a watch) three, two, now.\" A busy section of LA, night, people are walking past, talking. The camera sinks through the ground down into a round chamber, lit by fires in the alcoves along the wall. The ceiling is supported by a circle of pillars. A stone statue and two bowls holding more flames are set up, forming an equal triangle inside the circle of pillars. A demon walks in and stops in front of the statue.\nSahjhan: \"The weight of time is heavy on the world. And all men born must die. But there are worlds unknown, where dreamers dream and sleepers sleep, and patiently await. As pledged in Caladan by Cod-she, (Sahjhan steps back and throws some powder at the statue) One shall awaken in the first year of the final century. That one, who lived before and joined Cod-she in the great sleep. Arise, as was promised and foretold. Arise. - Arise!\" Nothing happens. The demon turns away and walks over to one of the fires and lights himself a cigarette. Turns back to watch the statue, puffing. Checks his watch. Takes another drag. Suddenly the room begins to shake and blue lighting flashes. The eyes of the statue suddenly turn into two open, human looking eyes. The statue cracks then crumbles to the ground in a cloud of dust. The demon puts out his cigarette and walks over to the figure huddled in the middle of what's left of the statue.\nSahjhan: \"Welcome to the twenty first century. (Crouches down and puts a hand on the back of the figure) Angelus is here. You'll see him soon. - You haven't used your muscles in a very long time. It will be a while before you're strong enough to...\" The figure suddenly straightens up.

Ted from 2030:...you drop everything and rush to his side only to find yourself standing there with no idea what to do or say.\nAt Marvin's funeral\nTed: This is the toughest time in Marshall's life and I feel absolutely useless. What can we do to help?\nLily: Don't look at me. This morning Marshall said, \"I have to pee.\" And I, \"Don't worry, baby, I'll do it for you.\" Halfway through the pee, I'm, like, \"This doesn't even make sense!\"\nRobin: Well, uh, I've been to a couple funerals, so I know my role: I'm Vice Girl. Whatever Marshall needs to get through this day, I got it right here.\nTed: Cigarettes, alcohol... Are these firecrackers? My God, Robin, you somehow crammed Tijuana into a purse.\nRobin, hushing: Be cool, nerds!\nLily: Marshall's mom hasn't eaten, slept or sat down since we got here. Wait! That can be my role! I'll take care of Judy!\nRobin: Yeah, but doesn't Marshall's mom hate you--the fact that you two aren't very close?\nTed, whispering: Sweet save.\nLily: Okay, yes, Judy and I aren't besties, but today, whatever she needs, I'm there. I'm on Judy duty.\nTed: \"Judy duty.\"\nBarney: She said \"doody.\"\nRobin: Really, guys? At a funeral?\nTed: Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy.\nBarney: Wait a minute! Today, we are gonna make Marshall laugh.\nRobin: How?\nBarney: Ted, what's the one thing that always cracks him up?\nTed: Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts.\nBarney: Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts, exactly! So we are gonna get our bro a four-star nad rattler. You search knees, feet, banisters, fire hydrants and diving boards, and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey sticks, golf clubs and riding crops.\nTed: What about animals?\nBarney: Uh... Claws, paws, talons, hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists. We can do this!\nMarshall: Hey, guys, sorry, uh... I left my charger back in New York, so my phone's out of juice. Does anyone have...?\nRobin: Outlet or USB?\nMarshall: Uh, outlet. Thank you. Oh...\nLily: Wow, you really do have everything in there, don't you?\nTed: You're like Mary Poppins, if her magic purse was also filled with drugs.\nRobin: \"If\"?

Grow up.\nReverend: I'm so sorry for your loss, Judy.\nJudy: Thank you, Reverend.\nReverend: Unfortunately, I can't. My daughter in Chicago just went into labor. But I'm leaving you in the capable hands of my second-in-command: my son.\nMarshall: Your son?\nReverend: Oh, you remember Trey. I'll go grab him.\nMarshall: Guys...

I can't believe my father's funeral service is being led by Trey \"The Noogie Machine\" Platt.\nTed: That guy gave you noogies? What, did he carry a stepladder?\nMarshall: He made me carry it.\nTrey: So, my dad has these questions he asks to help create a theme for the service, or whatever. Question one: \"What were your last words with the deceased?\" Lame. Question two:\nJudy: Wait... My last words with Marvin were lovely. I've been thinking about them a lot.\nMarshall's brother #1: Me, too. We went for a hike in the snow and had this amazing talk.\nMarshall's brother #2: My last day with Pop, he taught my son how to skate.\nTrey: Well, this is clearly yielding nothing. Thanks, Dad. Guess I'll have to fill the time with some jokes... again.\nJudy: \"Last words\" seems like a good theme. Marshall, do you remember the last thing your father said to you?\n[FLASHBACK]\nJudy: Bye, sweetie.\nMarshall: Bye, Mom.\nMarvin: Son, there's something I want to say before I leave.\nMarshall: Yeah, Dad?\nMarvin: Could I snag that extra pork chop for the flight?\nMarshall: I was gonna make a sandwich with that, Dad. Dad, don't they have food on the plane?\nMarvin: Yeah, but plane food is ass.\n[END OF FLASHBACK]\nMarshall: \"Plane food is ass.\" Those are the last words my father will ever say to me. Right after I denied the man a pork chop. Oh, God. Wait! I'm wrong! I'm wrong! That wasn't it! They couldn't find a cab so my dad called up from the street.\n[FLASHBACK]\nMarvin: Marshall! Looks like rain out here! I couldn't find an umbrella in your closet! You know who probably has an umbrella?\nMarshall: And then, well, see, my dad grew up in a small town, in another generation, so sometimes - totally well-meaningly - he'd say stuff like...\nMarvin: The Koreans across the hall! Hey, the Koreans are a trustworthy and generous people!\nMarshall: Dad...\nMarvin: I betcha one of the Koreans has an umbrella! Heck, they're Koreans!\n[END OF FLASHACK]\nMarshall: My dad's last words to me were a string of odd racial stereotypes.\nRobin: All that stuff was really nice!\nLily: Yeah! It's positive racism!\nMarshall: This is worse than the pork chop.\nBarney: This next clip is entitled, \"Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull\"\nTed: Let's see what happens.\nBarney: Here he comes... Oh! Oh! 'Cause he gets hit right in the nuts.\nTed: And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks.\nBarney: Fall off. Shorts just fall right off.\nMarshall: No, wait-- I'm wrong. That wasn't it. They couldn't find a cab, so I went down there.\n[FALSHBACK]\nMarshall: Hey, you were right. The Kangs did, in fact, have an umbrella.\nMarvin: Of course they did.\nJudy: Bye, sweetie.\nMarshall: Bye, Mom.\nMarvin: Hey, son, I just want to leave you with a little advice. Rent Crocodile Dundee III. I caught it on the cable last night. It totally holds up!\n[END OF FLASHBACK]\nMarshall: Crocodile Dundee III is the second-best of the Croc trilogy, so maybe I can live with that. (cell phone beeps) Oh, sorry, my phone's charged.\nMan: I, uh, I hear you're a woman who can get things.\nRobin: I've been known to locate certain objects from time to time.\nMan: I need vodka and dirty playing cards.\nRobin: I got ya.\nMarshall: Oh, my God.\nLily: What is it?\nMarshall: I have a voice mail from my dad.\nLily: You have a voice mail from your dad?\nRobin: How?\nMarshall: My phone's been out of juice, so he must've called me the day the he, uh...\nLily: Baby, are you okay?\nMarshall: I hold in my hand the last words my father will ever say to me. I'm gonna hit play.\nRobin: What's wrong?\nMarshall: What if it's worse than Crocodile Dundee III? I can't do this. I can't... My mom is about to collapse. I'm gonna...\nLily: Wait-- no, no, baby... Baby, I got it. Let me.\nRobin: You should listen to it. Just don't put too much pressure on it.\nTed: She's right. I mean, this idea that someone's last words have to be profound and meaningful? I mean, who can live up to that?\nBarney: Exactly. All those \"famous last word\" people supposedly said? They're all made up. Like that patriotic dude, Nathan Hale, from third-grade history?\n[FLASHBACK]\nNathan Hale: My I only regret is I have but one life to lose for my country.\n[END OF FLASHBACK]\nBarney: You know what his real last words were?\n[FLASHBACK]\nNathan Hale: I'm peeing my pants!\n[END OF FLASHBACK]\nBarney: True story.\nRobin: The point is, last words are overrated.\nTed: Look, think of it this way: you get to hear your dad's voice one last time.\nMarshall: I should go listen to this... alone, okay? I'll be back.\n(Marshall steps away)\nWoman: Hey, so, um, I heard you might have...\nRobin: You heard right. (whispering: ) I'm getting a reputation. So, what you need, mama? Come here.\n(Robin walk away with the woman)\nLily: Guys, listen to what just happened.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[FLASHBACK]\nLily: Judy, do you need a break? I'm happy to cook for a while.\nJudy: You think your snobby New York cooking is better than mine-- admit it! Well, go ahead, Lily, why don't you just whip up a batch of your fancy tofu sushi bagels! And choke on them!\n[END OF FLASHBACK]\nTed: Whoa. Are you okay?\nLily: Listen!\n[FLASHBACK]\n(Judy yawns)\nJudy: I'm gonna go take a nap.\n[END OF FLASHBACK]\nLily: Judy's finally sleeping and it's all because of me! Guys, I have a role: I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah!\nTed: Well, but this day is tough on you, too. You sure you can absorb all that?\nLily: Yeah! Robin gave me a little orange pill from her purse. I don't know what's in it, but things are flowin' pretty smooth right now.\nRobin: Hey, stay hydrated.\n(Marshall comes back)\nBarney: So?\nMarshall: I couldn't listen to it. Guys, this is hard.\nLily: We know, baby. But you'll always wonder, if you don't. Your dad loved you. It almost doesn't matter what he said.\nBarney: It doesn't. That's true.\nMarshall: Guys, guys, what if-- God forbid-- all of your dads died right now? What would their last words to you have been? Seriously.\nTed: I know mine. When I was in Cleveland last month, I went to visit my dad at his... post-divorce bachelor pad.\n[FLASHBACK]\nTed's dad: Been fun bro-ing out with you tonight, T-Dawg.\nTed: Yeah... so glad we can we can talk about our s*x lives now. That's totally an improvement.\nTed's dad: I hooked up with a younger woman the other week-- Donna Bromstead.\nTed: My prom date?!\nTed's dad: How far did you get, T-Dawg?\nTed: I have to go.\n[END OF FLASHBACK]\nMarshall: How would you like those to be your father's last words?\nTed: Well, they might be. Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop.\nMarshall: Lawyered. Lily?\n[FLASHBACK]\n(phone ringing)\nLily: Hello.\nLily's dad: Lily, it's Dad. Listen, I'm sort of in jail for not paying taxes for the last 25 years. ut bright side, I thought of a great new board game. \"Tax Evasion\", ages six to ten. Which is, ironically, what I might be looking at. Anyway, Pumpkin, I need $15,000.\nLily: Fooled ya. Leave a message after the beep. We'll get back to ya. Beep.\n[END OF FLASHBACK]\nMarshall: Lawyered. Robin?\n[FLASHBACK]\nRobin's dad: And so, despite the endless disappointment you've caused me, I pray that this will finally be the year you achieve something of actual significance. I'd love to stop lying to my friends about you being in a coma. Anyway, the point is, happy birthday, RJ.\n[END OF FLASHBACK]\nTed: That's awful.\nRobin: No, here's the awful part.\n[FLASHBACK]\nRobin: You remembered my birthday!\n[END OF FLASHBACK]\nMarshall: Lawyered. Now can we all just admit that last words are, in fact, a big deal?\nEveryone: Yes.\nBarney: Man, I always thought I had it rough not really knowing my dad, but... now I realize at least I'll never have to suffer like this. Our next video is called \"German Shepherd Activates Tennis Ball Cannon While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink.\"\nMarshall: Barney, please, Barney! It's... No more videos, okay? I just need a minute.\nJudy: Okay... okay, who is responsible for this? Who got Cousin Daphne drunk? She is 15 years old.\nRobin: Whoa, they grow big out here.\nBarney: And here's your phone number back.\nRobin: Judy, I...\nLily: I did it.\nJudy: What possible excuse could you have for this?\nLily: I'm from New York. We think getting minors drunk is funny.\nJudy: There's nothing funny about getting minors drunk! You should be ashamed, Lily! Ashamed! Mmm! Oh, cripes, that's tasty. Mmm! Mmm!\nLily: That salad's the first food she's eaten in two days. Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise and jelly beans, but it counts.\nTed: Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once.\nBarney: Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid.\nTed: Stupid.\nBarney: What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts.\nTed: Yes. Nothing beats the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the hit?(Barney hits Ted in the nuts) So that's it? No discussion?\nMarshall: I'm not going to listen. \"Rent Crocodile Dundee II\" are the last words that my father will ever say to me, and I think I can live with that.\nTed: Is he laughing?\nTed from 2030: Marshall really did think he could live with that. That is, until later, at the memorial service.\nJudy: My last talk with Marvin was so lovely.\nTed from 2030: The stories his mother and brothers told were so perfect.\nMarshall's brother #1: Then he picked my crying son up off the ice. He gave him a hug and said, \"Champ, it doesn't matter if you fall down once in a while.\"\nMarshall's brother #2: And as we hiked, a little deer appeared on the path. She hopped over to Dad and started eating-- right out of his hand.\nJudy: And then he kissed me and he said...\nMarshall's brother #1: \"I will always be proud of you\"\"\nMarshall's brother #2: \"Life is such a gift.\"\nJudy: \"You know something, gorgeous, I'm the luckiest man alive.\"\nBarney, his voice breaking: Lame.\nTed: These stories suck.\nRobin: Doesn't hold a candle to your Crocodile Dundee thing.\nLily: You're up next, baby.\nMarshall: I just need some air.\nLily: Baby, are you okay?\nMarshall: I have to listen to it. It's a pocket dial. It's nothing.\nLily: Hey, so it's a pocket dial. You have so many great memories with your dad. Who cares about the last one?\nBarney: She's right. Your dad was hilarious.\nMarshall: You guys don't get it, okay? None of you do. My dad was my hero. And he was my teacher. And he was my best friend. He always came through for me. And now he's just gone. And what am I left with? (scratchy electronic sounds) Thanks a lot, God! Thank you! You took my father, the greatest man that I have ever known, and you ripped him off this Earth, way too young! And he'll never get to meet our kids, Lily. (scratchy sounds continue) But we got this voice mail. Thank you so much for the voice mail! It's a great comfort! 'Cause whenever I'm starting to feel lonely or sad, or-- or you know what, or maybe a little bit cheated, at least I got the sound of his pocket to console me. How is this fair? You know, like, an entire human life and it just ends for no reason, and... and what are we left with?\n(scratchy sounds continue)\nMarvin's voice: Marshall? Oh, looks like I've been calling you for almost five minutes. How's my pocket sound? (laughing) Oh, sorry about that, buddy. Um, anyway, your mom and I had such a great time seeing you. I love you.\nLily: Looks like your dad came through one last time.\nMarshall: \"I love you.\" My father's last words to me are \"I love you.\"\nMarvin's voice: Ooh, and let me know if you find my foot cream. That fungus thing is acting up again.\nMarshall: \"I love you.\" My father's last words to me are \"I love you.\"\nEveryone: Yes. Yes, they were. We heard it. Loud and clear.\nMarshall: Bye, Pop.\nTed from 2030: So Marshall finally got up to speak. Funny thing, though...\nMarshall: Then my father said the last words that he'll ever say to me: \"Rent Crocodile Dundee III. I caught it on the cable last night and it totally holds up.\"\nTed from 2030: He decided to keep Marvin's real last words just for himself.\nJudy: Thanks.\nLily: For what?\nJudy: I know what you've been doing today. And I really needed it.\nLily: Any time.\nJudy: That dress makes you look like a Kansas City whore. Sorry, dear. Last one.\nAt Judy's\nMarshall: Oh, man. I should have rented Crocodile Dundee III.\nTed: Okay, seriously, how are you doing that?\nMarshall: Thanks. I'll be right back. And if I don't come back, well, then these are my last words to you all. I really, really, really love you guys. Now I'm going to go drop a deuce.\nTed from 2030: Last words-- it's a lot of pressure, kids.\nTed is making a phone call\nTed: Hi, Dad.\nLily is also making a phone call\nLily: Hi, Dad.\nRobin is calling her dad.\nRobin: Hi, Dad.\nBarney is calling his mother.\nBarney: Hey, Mom. I'm ready to meet my dad.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

        "prompt_0": "Pan over a mountain to a remote compound. A helicopter flies toward it. Inside are four armed guards and a prisoner in blue drab uniform with a black head covering over his/her head. Cut to helicopter flying over barbed wire fence and landing in a courtyard. Guards climb out and bring prisoner, hands and feet chained, with them. They walk into the facility, apparently some kind of jail. One soldier shows his badge and they are buzzed inside. The prisoner is brought through several locking doors. At the end of a hallway of jail cells, the prisoner's hood is released. It's Sydney. She looks at the prisoners in their cells as she is walked to the very end of the hallway and shoved into the end cell. They remove her cuffs and lock her in. Close up on Sydney's face. She looks stricken and lost.\nCut to flyover of LA by day. Cut to Lindsey followed by several NSC officers entering the JTF Center.\nLindsey: (to man on his left) If you find anything, you let me know Lauren! Pan across room to Lauren on telephone.\nLauren: I'll call you back. She hangs up telephone and falls into step with Lindsey.\nLindsey: Dixon spoken with the DCI?\nLauren: Yes.\nLindsey: Good. I want to make sure we have access to all computer accounts, emails, and correspondence seen in this office in the last two years.\nLauren: Yes, sir. I've already put a request in through Langley.\nLindsey: Who'd you talk to over there?\nLauren: Brandon. I'm on it. Lauren and Linsdey enter Dixon's office. Dixon stands behind his desk. Vaughn and Weiss stand in front of it. All turn toward Lindsey and Lauren as they enter.\nLindsey: I understand the Director of Intelligence has already conveyed his desire to transfer authority over this task force from your agency to mine. I expect you to cooperate fully.\nCut to Vaughn giving Lauren a really upset How could you do this!?' look.\nDixon (voiceover): No. Not exactly.\nCut to Lauren giving Vaughn a stubborn look and then addressing her eyes toward Dixon.\nDixon: I explained to my superiors that the decision was mine to withhold information from the NSC regarding Sydney Bristow's involvement in the Lazarey murder.\nCut to Vaughn and Weiss as they turn to assess Lindsey and Lauren's reaction to this news.\nDixon: And that the members of my staff in question were acting working under direct orders from me.\nLindsey: I see.\nDixon: My staff will remain on active duty and cooperate in any investigation\nLindsey: They're not your staff, Mr. Dixon. Not anymore.\nCut to Dixon's defiant stone face.\nLindsey (voiceover): I'm pulling your clearance until further notice.\nDixon: Mr. Lindsey, I would expect nothing less from you.\nLindsey: One of my men will escort you to a facility for questioning.\nCut to Dixon. He removes his badge and places it in a small manila envelope on his desk and walks toward Lindsey, anticipating his next statement:\nLindsey: In the meantime, you'll need to surrender all credentials and access cards Dixon hands Lindsey the envelope and walks out of the room, taking the steam out of Lindsey's sails in his speech. Vaughn gives Lauren another dirty look. She still looks defiantly back, her arms crossed. Lindsey moves to stand behind Dixon's desk to address Vaughn and Weiss.\nLindsey: Well, of course, you'll be questioned as well. Let's not make this any harder than it has to be.\nVaughn: It's too late for that. Vaughn turns to leave saying to Lauren as he walks out:\nVaughn: I need to talk to you right now\nCut to Lauren and Vaughn walking down a hallway. Vaughn is in front and Lauren is walking behind him, trying to catch up.\nLauren: Before you start, know that I did what I thought was right, given the information that I Vaughn turns back toward her and gets right in Lauren's face, obviously agitated.\nVaughn: Sydney is in Lindsey's custody because of you!\nLauren: The Lazarey murder was my assignment! Sydney murdered a Russian diplomat!\nVaughn: Okay, stop! Don't act like this is your first day on the job!\nLauren: Sydney is in NSC custody not !\nVaughn (cutting her off): No, she is in Lindsey's custody.\nLauren: You think Lindsey's unaccountable!?\nVaughn: Lauren, his operation is funded by black money. What the White House expects from him is results\nLauren: What you're suggesting is that I willfully participate in an orchestrated cover up!\nVaughn: No, but I would have hoped you'd be a person about this!\nLauren: While you clearly underestimate not only my ability to do my job but also, apparently, my humanity, you should know that not only do I believe I did the right thing, but the more you talk, the more suspicious I get! (beat) You're the one who got her out of the country, aren't you?\nCut to Vaughn. He doesn't answer, but she reads it on his face. Lauren (not as angry, more worried for Vaughn): Do you know what would happen to you if it becomes known that you helped a fugitive evade the Federal Government?\nVaughn (very snarky): I'm not concerned about myself right now Lauren sighs and looks down before looking back up with a bit of new defiance.\nLauren: If what you're suggesting is right, that to learn what happened to Sydney over the past two years Robert Lindsey intends to have surgery performed on her which will render her brain dead why would he have me write the White House brief? Vaughn looks shocked and worried by this new development.\nVaughn: What!? Lauren (more confident she's right now): He's asked me to go with him as an observer of Sydney's interrogation. This information disturbs Vaughn. Instead of being relieved, it's clear he's more worried.\nLauren (voiceover): Clearly, he's got nothing to hide Vaughn looks up to meet her eyes. It's clear he's disbelieving of her outlook on the matter.\nLauren: Michael for whatever reason, you're overreacting to this.\nCut to Vaughn. He's got that stubborn, annoyed face back in full force.\nLauren: I don't know how long I'll be gone So I guess I'll see you Lauren turns and walks away. Stay on Vaughn's face, worried, annoyed, determined. Cut to slo-mo of Jack walking across a hallway entrance leading to the main rotunda. He's staring intently at someone. He stops walking. Cut to Lindsey leaning over another agent at a desk. Pan to closeup of Lindsey's face as he realizes someone's eyes are upon him. He looks up and makes eye contact with Jack. They stare each other down for a long moment. Jack's stare is cold, and downright scary it says something akin to You mess with my daughter and I will kill you  Lindsey tries his best to stare back, but just hint of apprehension is in his expression. Jack coldly dismisses him, turns his head and walks away.\nCut to Jack walking down the hallway. Vaughn hurries behind him to catch up to him.\nVaughn: Jack, I wanna be a part of it. Vaughn falls into step with Jack. Jack (with a hint of his classic sarcasm): If I knew what you were talking about, I'd refuse anyway.\nVaughn: Come on I've thought of a half dozen scenarios to help Sydney Lindsey has to be shut down! He Jack suddenly stops and turns toward Vaughn.\nVaughn: Did your scenarios take into account that helping Sydney at this point will require breaking at least a dozen federal laws?\nVaughn (in an intense half-whisper): Just the fact that you're telling me this means you have something planned! Damn it, let me help!\nCut to Jack. He looks like he's undecided as to whether to accept Vaughn's offer. Cut back to Vaughn, looking more determined than ever.\nVaughn (still intense): If anything happens to Sydney (he shakes his head) Jack stares at Vaughn for a second, blinks, and then says:\nJack: Meet me in the parking garage in three minutes. Vaughn nods slightly as Jack walks away.\nCut to pan up of Sydney's cell. She's walking around, feeling for any crack, indent, anything she might be able to use to eventually escape. Another prisoner who can see her from his cell 90 degrees addresses her.\nPrisoner: Whatcha doin'? Sydney looks up at him, surprised.\nPrisoner: Were you lookin' for somethin'? Sydney stares at him for a moment. She's wary of him.\nSydney: Maybe The prisoner crawls to the end of his bed to speak at her through the bars of his cell.\nPrisoner (whispering): Hey if you find any I'll have some. If it's candy God, I'd love candy. Sydney looks at him almost pityingly for a moment and then gives a hint of a smile.\nPrisoner: I'm Campbell.\nSydney: Sydney. She smiles again. Campbell seems like he's a bit slow, or else is so broken from torture that he's become almost childlike.\nCampbell: Syd ney (as if trying out the sound of it) Campbell crawls along the bars to stand close to her.\nCampbell: Hey Hey Don't leave, okay? Please? Been a long time without someone to talk to Sydney just looks at him.\nCut to an overpass over a drainage canal. Pan to Jack and Vaughn on the side of a road.\nVaughn: So this contact we're meeting Former NSC? Jack gives Vaughn a sideways glance, his arms crossed.\nJack: No. He turns to look at Vaughn and then back at the road.\nVaughn: How are they gonna help us locate Sydney? Jack looks back at Vaughn.\nJack: We're waiting for Sloane. Vaughn's surprised and a bit annoyed by this news. He crosses his arms across his chest.\nVaughn: You called Sloane on this!? Jack doesn't answer, he just turns to look down the road. So does Vaughn. Cut to a black sedan driving toward them. Cut back to Jack and Vaughn.\nJack: You and I will be the prime suspects behind any intent to free Sydney from NSC custody. Sloane has agreed to make it seem as if it were the work of the Covenant. Do I trust him on this? Not necessarily. They both turn toward Sloane's car as he gets out and walks toward them, hands in his pockets.\nSloane: Gentlemen. According to my sources, Sydney is being held at Camp Williams. Off Jack's reaction, we cut to Vaughn.\nVaughn: Camp Williams is a Naval training facility, why would Lindsey take her there?\nJack: Because it's home to an unacknowledged NSC detention center used for the interrogation of suspected terrorists whose captivity the government won't admit to.\nSloane: So to help her, we'll need a tactical team. At least eight men, transportation, weapons, specialized backup I would suggest Brill.\nJack: I thought he was in Freetown?\nSloane: Oh no, not since the government fell. If he's available, Domier would know.\nJack: We'll need to get a hold of blueprints to Camp Williams Vaughn (cutting in, both men turn to look at him): The FEMA Central Office downtown. They should have a set of blueprints on file.\nJack (impressed): Good. We'll prep infiltration into the FEMA building. Meet back here in three hours.\nCut to Sloane. He suddenly looks amused by something.\nSloane: I told you, Jack We'd work together again. This statement seems to really burn Jack. He gives Sloane a look of death, and walks away, Vaughn following him. Pan over to Sloane, still amused.\nCut to a hallway in Camp Williams. Pan to Sydney, being rolled along on a stretcher, bound hand and foot. Cut to another helicopter flying towards Camp Williams. Cut to Lindsey and Lauren inside the copter. Lindsey looks out the window, Lauren surveys Lindsey as if trying to figure out which version of this man is the real truth, hers or Vaughn's.\nLindsey: Just so we're clear It's in all our best interests to make sure that no one on the Hill questions our ethics, Lauren. That's why I'm counting on you to write a thorough report chronicling our investigation to date, and our fair treatment of Sydney Bristow. Understood? Lauren stares at him.\nCut to Sydney being wheeled into what appears to be a cross between an emergency room and a torture chamber. Cut to the doctor' who looks decidedly creepy. The guards start to remove her restraints and Sydney starts to fight against them, but they keep her overpowered and transfer her to a table in the room and restrain her to it.\nCut to Lauren in the helicopter.\nLauren: But Sydney's made it very clear she doesn't remember anything.\nLindsey: But when we searched her flat in Rome, we found a coded message taped to the underside of her desk. Now, if she can decode that message, it may help us infiltrate or even take down the Covenant.\nLauren: What if she doesn't recognize the code?\nLindsey: As long as she demonstrates a willingness to cooperate, that surgery will be nothing more than a threat.\nCut to Sydney in the midst of being given electroshock by the evil doctor. The treatment stops. She takes in deep, gasping breaths. The doctor holds a sheaf of papers in front of her face.\nDoctor: Ms. Bristow, we know you know how to read this code Do you recognize your handwriting?\nSydney (panting): No I draw little hearts over my Is smiley faces sometimes\nDoctor: What you're feeling now? The pain from shock therapy? It's nothing There's another procedure neurostimulation We could use it to find out where you've been the last two years\nCut to Sydney, still panting with pain. His barb does affect her a little.\nDoctor: Decypher the text and we won't have to\nSydney: Don't bother negotiating with me! You better make sure I'm a vegetable when you're done with me The doctor turns his head and looks toward a slatted window where Lindsey stands watching, his arms crossed, not happy. Pushing a button to broadcast his voice into the room, he says:\nLindsey: Try a higher setting The doctor turns up the setting and shocks her again. Smash cut to black. End of Act One. Closeup on Sydney's shackled right hand as the evil doctor undoes the cuff after apparently more electroshock.\nDoctor: The human body is an amazing thing. A couple of hours you'll almost feel human again.\nCut to Sydney's face. Her eyes are closed, her face clammy and sweaty. She's obviously weak, in pain and exhausted. She opens her eyes and then we see a sudden determined look cross her face. The camera follows her gaze to the sheaf of papers the doctor had shoved in her face earlier. It's held together by a large paper clip.\nDoctor: You have a strong heart, though. You could survive another five six sessions. Sydney takes a sideways glance at the doctor. When his back is turned, she reaches out and palms the paper clip off the sheaf of papers.\nDoctor: That'll be a new record for both of us The doctor turns and Sydney just gives him as nasty a look as she can currently manage.\nCut to Lindsey exiting the torture area. Lauren comes up from behind him.\nLauren: I thought I was supposed to be observing? Lindsey turns around to face her and plasters a humoring smile on his face.\nLindsey: And you will as much as possible. But my interrogation of Agent Bristow includes a discussion of classified material.\nLauren: How can I report on an investigation I'm not part of?\nLindsey: We can talk about it Come on; I'll brief you on what I can Lindsey reaches out a hand to Lauren's arm as if to invite her to walk with him. She's having none of it.\nLauren: No, I'm sorry but if I'm going to chronicle our treatment of Sydney Bristow, I need to see how she's being treated. Lindsey's face immediately loses the patronizing smile and hardens.\nLindsey: How do you suppose it was that Sydney Bristow knew to flee the country before she was even aware the NSC wanted to take her into custody?\nCut to Lauren's reaction. She's definitely afraid of where Lindsey is going with this line of discussion.\nLindsey: With plane tickets? Fake passport? I doubt you want me looking into who it was that aided and abetted the escape of a wanted fugitive. Lauren looks shocked, betrayed. Her eyes are opened to Lindsey's true character for the first time. She shakes her head slightly, as if she can't believe she didn't see it before.\nLauren: That's why you asked for me. Legally, you needed a witness\nLindsey: Get to your office. You have a report to write. Lindsey turns and walks away, leaving Lauren to stare at him, wondering what the heck to do with the mess she's in.\nCut to Sydney being slammed down upon the mattress in her cell. She's gasping and her body twitches involuntarily as an aftereffect of the shock treatments.\nCampbell (whispering): Sydney they didn't give you one Sydney looks up to see Campbell holding out a wool blanket to her through the bars of his cell.\nCampbell: It's cold at night. Sydney takes the blanket.\nSydney (whispering): Thank you. She wraps the blanket around herself.\nCampbell: This is not the best place. Sydney snickers at the extreme understatement. She lies back down, this time on her stomach. Her body still twitches.\nCampbell: They wanted to know about Iran when I was there assigned. What do they wanna know about you? Sydney looks at Campbell with almost tears in her eyes but doesn't answer. Campbell (in a whispering determined voice): Don't give it to them! Sydney nods and then lies down on her side, facing away from Campbell. She opens the palm of her hand and we see she's still holding the paper clip. Her body still twitches. She touches it with her other hand and then clutches it tightly, as if it were a lifeline.\nCut to a chessboard complete with timer clocks. A black man's hand moves a piece on the board, taking a white piece. Cut up to the man's face. He's probably in his 50's, mustache, wearing a cap and a green army jacket, smoking a cigar.\nMan: That's checkmate in three moves. Do you wanna give me my 50 bucks now or do we go through the motions? I got all day.\nCut to his opponent, a young white man in his early 20's. He looks down at the board, disgusted and then pulls the money out of his pocket and throws it on the table. As the man gets up to walk away the winning man asks:\nMan: That's not tuition money, is it? The man snickers as the young man gets up and leaves. The black man starts to reset the pieces on the board. He's almost finished when we see a 100 dollar bill laid onto the center of the board.\nJack (voiceover): I'll put you in checkmate in ten moves. The man looks up at him assessingly and then answers:\nMan: Yeah if I play with my eyes closed.\nCut to wider angle. Jack sits down opposite the man; Vaughn sits in a chair to the side of Jack. Jack starts resetting the pieces on his side of the board.\nJack: Long time\nMan: Chile, '73. Should've never helped overthrow Allende.\nJack: Thomas Brill, Michael Vaughn. Vaughn and Brill make eye contact. Vaughn nods once at Brill. Brill leans back in his chair a little, assessing Vaughn. Brill (a little bit of surprise in his voice): You Bill Vaughn's kid?\nCut to Vaughn's reaction. He's surprised this man apparently knew his father.\nVaughn: Yeah, he was my father.\nBrill: He was a good man.\nVaughn: Thank you.\nJack: You interested in a high-risk extraction? Jack makes a move on the chessboard and clicks the button on his timer.\nBrill: Always. Paint me a picture.\nJack: Camp Williams Detention Center.\nBrill: Blind?\nJack: Blueprints. Sloane's designing the op.\nBrill (amused): Well, look who's putting the band back together? Vaughn gives Jack an annoyed look.\nBrill: Rules of engagement. Brill makes a move on the chessboard and pushes his timer button.\nJack: The facility is protected by two dozen DoD personnel. Lethal force is not an option.\nBrill: Well, if were going to use tranqs, I'm gonna need another 5 freelancers. It's not gonna be cheap, Jack: 250K per hire another 9 for the chopper Brill moves a piece on the chessboard and clicks his timer button.\nBrill: and for the non-lethal gunmetal? Add another 6.\nJack: Done. Meet me at this address it two hours. Jack places a business card down onto the table. He moves another piece on the chessboard.\nJack: Checkmate. Jack smiles at Brill, who looks surprised. Cut to Vaughn and Jack walking away from the table.\nVaughn (apprehensive): You just agreed to pay him 2 million dollars\nJack (unperturbed): Three.\nCut to the inside of a dark room as Jack opens a sliding metal door, shedding light into it. He hits a light switch illuminating the room and enters. Vaughn walks in behind him looking around. There's a large stockpile of automatic weapons, bombs, flak jackets, medical supplies, etc.\nVaughn: What the hell is this?\nJack: Storage. Jack drops an empty black backpack onto the table and then bends down to type in the combination on a safe. Vaughn closes the door behind them. Jack opens the door to the safe to reveal huge stacks of cellophane wrapped cash. Jack starts grabbing the cash bundles and depositing them on the table behind him in front of Vaughn, who picks up the first couple of bundles to look at them and then starts to load the money into the backpack.\nVaughn: The fact that you're letting me see this place means it's not your only one, is it? Jack deposits more money on the table and gives Vaughn a glance. Jack (with the barest hint of amusement): You're smarter than you look Vaughn half smiles and continues to load money into the backpack.\nCut to an external view of Camp Williams through the fence. Cut to a computer screen as the words I, Lauren Reed are typed onto it and stop. Cut to Lauren. She's still obviously torn and not sure what she should do. She's pretty sure now that Vaughn was right about Sydney's treatment, seeing that she isn't being allowed to view it, and that she's being blackmailed to write a whitewashed report. But at the same time, she doesn't want her husband to get in trouble. She leans her elbows on the desk and leans her mouth into her hands, closing her eyes.\nCut to Sydney's gurney pushing through a set of doors. Again, she's shackled to the gurney. As she's wheeled into the interrogation room, the doctor greets her:\nDoctor: Miss Bristow! You look better. The guards have wheeled the gurney parallel to the table.\nSydney (sarcastic): Yeah, I feel great thanks.\nDoctor: I hear you're making friends with your cellmate!\nCut to a closeup of Sydney's right hand. She's bent the paper clip out straight and uses the point to unlock the restraint on that hand. The doctor signs the transfer paperwork for the guard.\nDoctor: He's a journalist you know in the Middle East. Story is he died in a car accident. Truth is he was protecting his source. Hee hee He thought the 1st amendment would protect him The guard undoes the left shackle on Sydney's hand.\nDoctor: He's strong though, like you Sydney takes the opportunity to swing across and hit the guard in the nose with her right palm, kicking out with her foot at the other one at the foot of the gurney. She gets up and kicks out the second guard again and then ducks as the doctor swings a long metal pole at her. She kicks the doctor in the stomach, knocking him over. The 1st guard picks up a tranq gun, but Syd kicks the gurney into him, knocking the gun out of his hand. It clatters to the floor. The doctor and Sydney both jump for it. They struggle over the gun and then Sydney shoots the tranq dart into the doctor's abdomen and makes a run for it.\nCut to Sydney bolting from the room and down a corridor as an announcement blares over the loudspeaker: Code red. Prisoner loose in corridor mark three three. Initiate lockdown procedures.\nCut to Lauren, typing on her laptop. She looks up as two guards run past her window.\nGuard: I'm on it!\nCut to Sydney as she bursts through a set of doors. She's immediately brutally clotheslined by a guard with a clubbing stick. Sydney drops to the floor. Other guards come running. Syd flips the first guard, but before she can run again, she's grabbed by each arm by other guards.\nGuard #1: Hold her! Guard #1 viciously shoves his baton into Syd's stomach. Cut to Lauren running from the room into the hallway. Cut back to what she sees at the end of the hallway: The two guards holding Sydney's arms slamming her face first into the wall and then a guard from behind her yells:\nGuard: Quiet! And then he tasers Sydney in the back. Sydney screams as her legs give out from under her. As Lauren watches, the guards drag a limp and whimpering Sydney around the corner out of view. Close up on Lauren's face. She looks down and nods as if to say, Yep I knew it I've been played they are torturing her She looks back up and her face hardens with resolve. Cut to black. End of Act Two.\nCut to Sloane, sitting inside a van in front of a laptop computer. The sliding door to the van opens and Vaughn climbs inside, dressed in a workman's jumpsuit. He sits down next to Jack.\nVaughn: I found the junction box and planted the video scrambler. When you activate this (hands Jack a small item, looks like a remote car starter) it'll lock down the security system for as long as it takes for you to copy the blueprints. Any word from Brill?\nJack: He should have the team hired and equipped in time for tonight as long as we're successful and get the blueprints.\nCut to the computer screen as Sloane works.\nSloane: There we go Okay, I got us into the trunk exchange. Now every incoming and outgoing call to the FEMA building will be rerouted through this number. (to Jack) You're ready. Jack hits the button on the scrambler. (This great 70's type funk song What Do I Have To Do To Prove My Love For You? kicks in.) Cut to the front desk as the security guard watches the monitors turn to snow. Guard turns to official looking guy next to him.\nGuard: Sir, we lost picture. Official guy puts down the paper he was reading and picks up the telephone and dials a number.\nCut to Vaughn in the van as his cell phone rings.\nVaughn: Weller Security, can you hold?\nOfficial: No, I can't. This is the LA EOC. All my screens just went blank.\nVaughn: Did you reboot?\nOfficial: We're doing it now.\nVaughn: Well, I've got a man in the area; I'll send him over. Vaughn turns off the cell phone and nods to Jack. Cut to Jack as he swaggers into the FEMA building. He shows his ID badge. With a very blue-collarish almost New York accent, he says.\nJack: Yeah, I got a call. You guys down?\nOfficial: Where's Stuart?\nJack: Sick. Got a nasal infection freakin' nightmare!\nCut to Vaughn and Sloane climbing down a ladder inside a manhole. Vaughn is carrying a large briefcase.\nSloane: I've been doing this longer than you. Jack could've taken a camera in there.\nVaughn: If they sweep him a find a camera? This is all over Vaughn opens the case and pulls out a laptop and a long cable with a tiny camera lens on the end. Cut to inside the FEMA building. The security guard rounds the kiosk toward Jack.\nGuard: Federal security measures require that we make a thorough search\nJack: Hey, I'm new, but I'm not new all right? I know the protocol. Guard uses a handheld metal detector on Jack. He's clean.\nOfficial: Then you know I gotta stay with you at all times.\nJack: Right. Right. Just give me the tools and show me the way. Official hands Jack a small zippered tool folio. Cut to Vaughn starting up the laptop. Cut to Jack and Official walking toward the computer room.\nOfficial: It's right over here.\nJack: This shouldn't take too long. In the meantime, you might wanna make sure your data files are backed up.\nOfficial: I already did.\nJack: Right. Jack starts to unscrew a panel on one of the mainframe computers. Official guy sits down to watch. Cut to Vaughn, who has connected the laptop to the camera. We're seeing snow on the screen.\nSloane: Having spent a significant amount of time with your wife over the past year, I think it's safe to say that you're a lucky man. Vaughn pauses, then says:\nVaughn: Yes I am.\nSloane: I imagine that all of this is something of a strain on your relationship, hmm? Vaughn looks very annoyed but refuses to rise to Sloane's bait. He feeds the camera into a hole that wires are coming out of at the junction box.\nVaughn: Terminal twelve will take us up Vaughn gives Sloane a dirty side glance. Cut to the computer screen as the camera lens climbs higher. He looks up at Sloane.\nVaughn: Make the call.\nCut to the telephone ringing at the main kiosk. The security guard answers.\nGuard: Federal Emergency Management.\nSloane: Yeah, this is Director Blackman. I've just been pulled from a meeting with the Secretary of Defense to find out that your branch has been dark for the past thirty minutes.\nGuard: Yes, well we're working on it. My supervisor's in with the technician now Sloane (cutting him off, very pompous sounding): Whoa son, son Now I'm sure you're aware that the chances of a terrorist attack on the city of Los Angeles are extraordinarily high. And if, God forbid, something like that should befall us, I would expect that the central office tasked with the management of such an emergency would be prepared!\nCut to Vaughn as he continues to feed the camera wire up the hole.\nSloane: So, why don't you get your supervisor on the line right now? Guard picks up a walkie talkie.\nGuard: Sir, Director Blackman's on blue. You need to speak with him now Official looks annoyed and nervous.\nOfficial: I'm on my way (to Jack) You wait here. As soon as the Official leaves the room Jack starts hurriedly searching through blueprint drawers. Cut to Vaughn, still feeding the camera. Cut back to Jack still searching drawers. Focus from Jack to the security camera on the wall behind him. Suddenly a small cable comes out the bottom of it and turns in Jack's direction. Cut to the laptop screen as the camera on the cable turns and sees Jack.\nVaughn: There he is.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCut to Official, picking up telephone. He turns to security guard and says:\nOfficial: Go check on the alarm guy.\nGuard: Yes, sir. As guard gets up and leaves, Official answers phone.\nOfficial: Director Blackman\nCut to Jack searching more drawers. He finds the stack he's looking for. He starts holding them up to the camera while Vaughn snaps pictures of them.\nSloane (on phone to Official): As I'm sure you're aware, the people of Los Angeles face a myriad of disasters\nCut to Jack, holding up blueprints. Cut to guard, walking down the hallway toward where Jack is. Cut back to Jack holding up blueprints. Cut to Vaughn, studying them and taking pictures.\nSloane: No, we're not just talking about terrorism. In case you haven't noticed, we're due for another earthquake (cut to Official looking flabbergasted and can't get a word in edgewise) Plus, because of the recent forest fires, we're susceptible to mudslides.\nCut to guard, unlocking the door leading to the hallway where the room where Jack is.\nSloane: Not to mention the fact that there seems to be a riot breaking out every time the Lakers win! Jack holds up the last blueprint and Vaughn gets a copy of it. He looks up and nods at Sloane. Sloane (with a brush off tone): Just make sure you get it done. (He hangs up.)\nCut to guard as he enters the control room. Jack is just screwing in the last screw in the computer mainframe. He looks up at the guard.\nJack: That'll do it Should be back online. Jack zips up the tool case and hands it to the guard.\nGuard: Great.\nCut to the main kiosk as the monitors blink back into life. Pan up to Official, nodding with satisfaction. Jack and Guard round corner.\nJack: Take it easy. Jack starts to walk away.\nOfficial (to guard): Get Blackman. He'll wanna know we're back online right away.\nCut to Jack's look of panic at this announcement. He walks a little swifter toward the door.\nGuard: Director Blackman, please. (pause, listening) Out of the country!? I just spoke with him; he said he was in Washington! Guard looks over at Official with confusion. Official looks up at Jack suddenly with suspicion.\nOfficial (yelling at Jack): Hey! Jack has just exited the door and keeps walking briskly as the van hastily pulls up into the drive. Official and Guard rush out after Jack. Jack starts to run for the van.\nOfficial: Stop where you are! Sloane gets out of the van waving Jack toward it frantically.\nOfficial: Stop where you are! Guard draws a gun.\nGuard: Hands in the air!\nCut to Sloane, still waving Jack on, gives him a hand up into the van just as the guard takes aim and shoots. Sloane purposefully uses his body to shield Jack's and is shot in the chest, falling backward into the van. Jack looks shocked as the van screeches away. Cut to black. End of Act Three. Opens to black. Suddenly there's light as the door to Jack's Storage facility opens. Jack and Vaughn are supporting a groaning Sloane between them. Jack shoves papers from the metal table.\nJack (to Vaughn): Get him down on the table. As Vaughn gets Sloane to lie on the table, Jack grabs a wool blanket to prop up his head. Vaughn rushes to the door to close it behind them. Jack goes over to the medical supplies across the room and wheels a rolling chest of drawers up next to him.\nJack (to Vaughn): Get me 4 by 4s. Vaughn opens a cabinet to grab a handful of gauze pads. Jack opens the top drawer of the dresser to reveal medical scissors and other sterile supplies. Jack pulls out the scissors and starts cutting Sloane's T-shirt away from the gunshot wound. Sloane is moaning and grimacing.\nJack (to Sloane): Just breathe! Just breathe! As Jack moves the shirt aside to reveal the wound, Vaughn hurries over to the other side of the table.\nVaughn: Okay.\nJack: Keep pressure applied to the wound. Vaughn takes the gauze and places it over the wound and applies pressure with both hands. Jack takes a needle and starts to fill it from a small bottle.\nVaughn: What is that?\nJack: Morphine.\nSloane: No! No morphine! I'll go into anaphylactic shock!\nJack: Arvin We have to dig the bullet out.\nSloane: If you give me morphine, I'll be dead before you get to the bullet (cough) And don't get any ideas Jack puts down the needle and bottle and grabs a nylon strap that one would use as a rifle strap and starts to bind Sloane arms down to the table.\nJack: I have to do this to keep you from thrashing.\nSloane (whispering): Okay .okay. Vaughn and Jack bind Sloane to the table in two places.\nJack (to Vaughn): Gimme your belt to bite down on.\nSloane (groaning): Oh, I don't need a belt Jack (to Vaughn) Do it! Vaughn pulls off his belt and puts it between Sloane's teeth.\nJack: I need some light. Vaughn carries a spotlight over and shines it right down onto Sloane's chest. Jack puts the clamp into the wound and starts digging around for the bullet. Cut to Sloane grimacing badly and biting hard on the belt until he finally passes out from the pain.\nVaughn: He passed out.\nJack: Good. (pulling on clamp, which is presumably now holding the bullet) Almost Jack gives a final tug, and the bloody bullet is removed. He drops it into a metal container with a clang.\nCut to Sydney, lying in her cell as she starts to wake.\nCampbell (off screen): Morning\nSydney (not moving yet): Hi Sydney moans and then struggles to sit up. Cut to Campbell.\nCampbell: Think about the ocean When I don't feel good, that's what I do. My son liked boats He was six Maybe he's still six I think I think he's older now.\nSydney (almost in tears): What is your son's name? Campbell (tears crowding in his eyes): His name was Benjamin (nods) Benjamin. Sydney nods and gives him a tiny smile, empathizing with Campbell. Cut back to passed out Sloane on the table in Jack's storage facility. Cut to Jack, clamp still in gloved hand, using a needle to sew up Sloane's wound.\nVaughn: I can't believe I'm actually going to ask this, but is he gonna be all right? Cut back to Jack, wearing small oval almost half-moon type spectacles on the end of his nose and continuing to sew.\nJack: He'll recover. The bullet nearly pierced his axillary artery. Vaughn studies Jack for a moment and then says:\nVaughn: I didn't know you wore glasses ? Jack looks up over the top of his spectacles and gives Vaughn a dry look.\nJack: Only during surgery.\nVaughn: (beat) Well, I'm gonna go download the blueprints from the digital camera, but we're still gonna need security codes to get into Camp Williams.\nJack: Try Marshall. He should be able to log onto the NSC archive from his station at the rotunda.\nVaughn: That's gonna be a little tricky with all the NSC agents crawling everywhere. Jack (with a hint of pointed sarcasm): Yes If only Marshall had a well-trained CIA operative to assist him. Vaughn stares at Jack for a long moment and then a hint of a smile blooms on his face.\nVaughn: You're starting to like me again. Jack gives him a short, dry look over the top of his glasses, but says nothing. Vaughn gets up and moves to the door.\nJack: Vaughn. Vaughn turns around to face him.\nJack: With or without those codes We'll be infiltrating Camp Williams in five hours.\nCut to Lindsey as a jail gate opens and he walks through it. Lauren walks up behind him from the side and says to his back:\nLauren: Here's your draft I think you'll like it. Lindsey opens the file and begins to look it over.\nLindsey: If I was tough on you before, I apologize.\nLauren: I'm not naïve. I understand that under certain circumstances, unorthodox methods may be required but that doesn't excuse your blackmailing me by threatening to arrest my husband. Lindsey (clearly having not listened to a word Lauren has said, instead reading her report): Yeah Don't mention Vasson his reputation precedes him. And nothing about Campbell or the other prisoners, just stick with Bristow. Yeah, the rest is fine. Deliver this to Miller; he has operational control of the Rotunda while I'm here. We'll want you back in, uh (checks his watch) six hours to report on the results. Lindsey walks off and Lauren gives his back a significant pissed off look.\nCut to the NSC officers crawling over the Rotunda, peering over people's shoulders, etc. as Vaughn walks in and heads straight to Marshall's office.\nVaughn: Marshall If I needed you access class Marshall turns around. He's wearing huge horn-rimmed glasses with really thick lenses that magnify his eyes.\nMarshall: Hey, check it out look Telephoto lenses based on an owl's eye. Now, let's say you're out in the field, doing and you need to get in you just press this button and Whoa! (beat) Nice pores You exfoliate? Vaughn shakes his head.\nVaughn: Look, if I needed you to access classified documents on the NSC's computer network, could you do it?\nMarshall: Oh I don't have access. Marshall turns away, cleaning the owl-eye glasses on his shirt.\nVaughn (pointedly): I know. Marshall looks over his shoulder at Vaughn. They exchange a significant look and Vaughn nods slightly.\nMarshall (whispering): Forensic guys are monitoring the network\nVaughn: Isn't there any way to bypass that?\nMarshall: Of course it's me, but Marshall and Vaughn share another look, then Marshall goes to the end of his workbench and unearths an Xbox console. Marshall (excitement showing in his voice): I give you the codes, you're gonna bust her out, aren't ya .kick some NSC booty? Can I just say? Love Marshall grabs a small flatscreen monitor and begins connecting it to the Xbox and then grabs a keyboard down off a shelf.\nCut to Sloane, who is now awake on the same table. Jack is administering a pint of blood intravenously.\nJack: I've been trying to think of a single reason why you saved my life The only conclusion I've come to is that it would incur some feeling of debt on my part.\nSloane: As usual, Jack, you're in danger or outsmarting yourself. The US Government has pardoned me for my crimes. The international community regards me as a humanitarian. But you and Sydney still believe I am pursuing some hidden agenda. Now, whatever you may perceive that agenda to be, clearly it would be easier to attain if you were both dead, given that you're my most vocal detractors, my most capable antagonists.\nJack: Or you need us for something something you believe only we can provide.\nSloane: Well .Well, you're right about that. No humanitarian endeavor can ever fill the void left by my past crimes like the death of my wife. You and Sydney are my absolution, my penance. You're all I have left. Jack stares at Sloane.\nCut to Marshall and Vaughn in Marshall's office. Marshall is busy working on accessing the NSC network via his Xbox.\nVaughn (looking over his shoulder): Anything?\nMarshall: Just about should be\nCut to screen as Marshall types Find CampWilliams and gets back a negative reply. His face shows his shock.\nVaughn: What?\nMarshall: Well, the file that would have the access codes has been deleted.\nCut to Vaughn's reaction; it's grim.\nMarshall (in disbelief): All files pertaining to Camp Williams have been removed. The door to Marshall's office opens and they both look back quickly. It's Lauren, looking frantic.\nLauren (breathless): Michael Vaughn looks back at her with a Holy Crap, this is Bad look. Marshall is looking very unnerved and isn't sure how to react. Lauren gives a sparing glance at Marshall and then back at Vaughn as if to say to Marshall, :I need to talk to him. Vaughn is still staring at Lauren.\nMarshall: Actually I'm gonna Uh, take off cause this is definitely something I should not (beat) Pardon me Marshall gets out of his chair and bolts from the room. As Marshall leaves, Lauren says to Vaughn, distressed:\nLauren: You were right about Lindsey. I thought I could exercise some degree of control over the interrogation, but he just wanted me to write a report whitewashing the whole thing. Vaughn has slowly walked toward her until he's standing right in front of her.\nLauren: I know you're working on something. (beat) I wanna help.\nCut to MPs walking down a hallway in Camp Williams. Gates open before them as they pass. Cut to Sydney with a resigned look on her face. She assumes they're coming to get her again. She's shocked when they turn and instead open Campbell's door.\nGuard #1 (roughly): On your feet, let's go! On your feet! The guards grab him roughly and yank him to his feet.\nSydney (worried): Hey The guard elbows Campbell in the stomach and then the other punches him.\nSydney: Hey! What are you doing to him!?\nLindsey (offscreen): That all depends on you\nCut to Lindsey as he walks toward her cell and stands in front of her.\nLindsey: Help me out, Syd. One of the guards pulls out a hollow bladed knife and holds it up menacingly.\nSydney: Wait!\nLindsey: There's no time to wait. Lindsey nods toward the guard and the guard stabs Campbell in the upper leg. He drops to his knees in pain and screams.\nSydney: You son of a b****! Leave him alone! He's got nothing to do with this! You leave him alone!\nLinsday (talking over Sydney): You can stop this by deciphering the code.\nSydney: He has nothing to do with this! I will kill you for this! The guards stab Campbell in the stomach.\nSydney: Oh my God! Okay, stop..stop I'll tell you what it says. (beat, Lindsey looks at her expectantly) They're coordinates.\nLindsey: To what?\nSydney: I don't know. For the hundredth time, I don't remember anything about those two years. All I can tell you is what they are.\nLindsey: Tell me. Sydney looks over at Campbell, sobbing with pain.\nSydney (her eyes on Campbell): North 34 degrees, 09 minutes, 55.9 seconds; (her voice rising with distress) West 118 degrees, 17 minutes, 15.3 seconds! Lindsey looks toward Campbell's cell, and nods.\nLindsey: Get a team prepped. The guards drop Campbell's arms and walk away. The camera stays on Campbell, then back to Lindsey who is still looking at him.\nLindsey (to Campbell): Well done. Cut back to Campbell and then to Sydney. Campbell straightens and stands, clearly not in any pain at all. Lindsey turns and gives Sydney a significant look. Sydney suddenly realizes she's been duped.\nSydney: Oh my God Oh God Campbell comes out of the cell and faces her.\nCampbell: I'm not Campbell; I'm Shaptner. Your personality profile revealed your one major weakness: empathetic suffering is harder for you to sustain than physical torture.\nCut to Sydney, crying.\nCampbell: So thanks for carin'. Campbell turns and walks away.\nLindsey: There's just one procedure left, Agent Bristow. We'll have the neurostimulation prepped in about an hour and we'll finally know what happened to you in the last two years. Focus in on Sydney's face through the bars. She's crying and she lets out one gasping sob. Cut to black. End of Act Four.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPan up from a drill-like machine to a man's hand holding a device, to Dr. Vasson's smirking face.\nVasson: This is a cranial shunt. After I drill a hole in your skull, I'll use it to drain the water from your brain panel.\nCut to Sydney, whose head is being affixed with a metal plate across her forehead. She is trying to maintain her composure in the face of this horror. Cut to Lindsey, leaning against the wall, blank faced, watching.\nVasson: Once you're unconscious, we'll remove your skull cap and begin neurostimulation.\nCut to a military type transport truck driving down a road at night. Cut to interior of truck back where Jack, Vaughn, Brill and his team are riding. All are dressed in black.\nJack: We have an operative inside who will gain access to the security room and initiate a reverse lockdown protocol, thereby containing the bulk of the MPs in their patrol areas.\nBrill: Once entry is made, we'll proceed to the restricted cellblock where Agent Bristow is being held. (to Jack and Vaughn) Hope your man inside knows what he's doing.\nVaughn: She does.\nCut to Lauren being let into the security room by an MP.\nMP: I have Lauren Reed here to see Director Lindsey.\nMP#2: Wait here. I'll let him know you're on base. MP and MP#2 leave room, leaving Lauren alone with a lone MP across the room, watching security cameras. Lauren sits down on the counter right next to the control box and surreptitiously connects a device to the side of it and activates it.\nCut to the exterior entry to Camp Williams, still locked and being guarded by two guards.\nBrill: I hate to ask the obvious, but what's taking so long?\nJack: The override program has to be placed within five inches of the central control station. Once that happens, it'll lockdown the internal doors and open that main gate. Then we move.\nCut to the security room where Lauren is still waiting. The back door opens and in walks Shaptner (aka Campbell) now wearing a sharp three piece suit.\nShaptner (to MP#3): I'm gonna need a chopper to Fort Lewis.\nMP#3: Yes, Sir. I'll check with the duty officer. Shaptner approaches Lauren with a knowing smile on his face.\nShaptner: Lauren Reed Director Lindsey's told me all about you; says you're gonna write a stellar report for us He shakes Lauren's hand, which she returns reluctantly. Suddenly, the security monitor loses picture. Shaptner turns around to look at the snowy screen as Lauren looks worried.\nCut to the exterior of Camp Williams main gate as the access door begins to open. Brill lifts his rifle and aims.\nBrill: Okay, here we go. Brill fires tranq darts into the two guards at the gate. They drop to the ground and then the team, with face masks on, climbs down the hill and enters Camp Williams. Cut back to the control room.\nShaptner (offscreen to MP#3): What is it? MP#3 taps on the computer keyboard; nothing changes. The picture is still just snow.\nMP#3: Something's overriding the system. Shaptner heads toward the door he came into, but finds it's locked. He turns suddenly and stalks across the room at Lauren.\nShaptner: What did you do!?\nLauren: Nothing. Shaptner punches Lauren right across the face. She falls into the table she'd just been sitting on and falls to the floor, apparently unconscious.\nCut to the team, entering the restricted cellblock.\nBrill: Secure the perimeter. We can't afford to have any hostiles on this floor. Cut back to Shaptner and the MP#3 in the control room. Shaptner is trying to hotwire the door open. It works, and he enters the hallway.\nCut to Vaughn tranqing a guard as Jack runs down the narrow corridor toward the end cell where Sydney was being held.\nJack: She's not here!\nCut to Lindsey and then pan to Dr. Vasson's hand, holding a facemask. He slowly, almost sickly lovingly starts to place the mask over Sydney's nose and mouth, when the door to the room blasts open. Vaughn takes out the MP in the room, while Jack gets Lindsey right in the chest with his dart. Vaughn gets Dr. Vasson and then bends over and starts undoing the restraint on Sydney's right wrist. Jack starts undoing the restraints on her ankles. Once Sydney's hand is free, she brushes at the clamp that held her head in place, as if eager to get the heck out of there. Jack looks up and then suddenly\nJack: Sydney!\nCut to Dr. Vasson wobbling to his feet, aiming a gun right at Sydney and about to shoot. Sydney reaches for a scalpel with her freed right hand from the table beside her and whips it at him. It gets him right in the throat and he falls over. Vaughn and Jack pull Sydney up from the table as she's still coughing from the little effect she'd had from the sedative. Jack pulls his mask up so Sydney can see his face.\nJack: Sydney\nSydney: Dad! Jack helps her to her feet and puts her arm across his shoulder to help her out.\nJack: Sydney, you're all right, sweetheart. You're all right.\nCut to the team and Sydney running down a cellblock hallway. They turn a corner and suddenly at the end of the hallway appears Shaptner from around the corner, shooting at them (with a real gun as opposed to tranqs, I might add...) Team members take cover and attempt to fire back. Shaptner appears to have the upper hand when suddenly, he is shot from beside him and he collapses to the ground. The camera pans sideways until it rests on Lauren, in shock, the gun she just used dangling loosely from her fingertips as she lowers it.\nCut to a heliocopter on the landing pad and pan to the team running toward it for their escape. The pilots door swings open and there is Arvin Sloane waving the team toward him. Sydney looks back at her father in confused shock.\nJack: He's with us; get in! Sydney and the rest of the team gets on the chopper as Sloane gives them a hand up. Brill's team leaves in the same convoy truck they came in. The helicopter takes off as the truck drives away. Sydney stares listlessly out the window. Cut to Lauren sitting with Vaughn. Lauren has both her hands on her chest. She appears to be in total shock over just having killed someone. Vaughn looks on worriedly. Cut to Jack, watching Sydney with concern.\nSydney: They wanted a code deciphered That's what all this was about; a code.\nJack: Well, what was it?\nSydney: Coordinates. I gave Lindsey the wrong coordinates; I didn't know what to do. Jack puts his arm around Sydney and pulls her to rest her head on his shoulder.\nJack: You made it, Sydney (beat) You made it.

Kunerth Teleplay by Richard Goodman\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching TV, and we hear Mr. Treeger in the bathroom.]\nMr. Treeger: Ohhh, man!!\nJoey: (coming in from his bedroom) What is that?\nChandler: Treeger's snaking the shower drain.\nMr. Treeger: What in the name of hell?\nJoey: Maybe he found you flip-flop.\n(Joey sits down and changes the channel, and we see two people making out.)\nChandler: Hey!\nJoey: Whoa! Is this p0rn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.\nChandler: Do we pay for this?\nJoey: No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.\nChandler: Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone s*x.\nJoey: Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he just said.)\nMr. Treeger: (coming in from the bathroom) Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.\nChandler: Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!\nMr. Treeger: Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.\nChandler: Like finding money with naked people on it!\nMr. Treeger: Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad. (Exits.)\nJoey: (to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)\nOPENING CREDITS\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that morning. The p0rn is still on, there are three women getting ready to shave the chest of some guy. Joey and Chandler are wondering why that guy is letting them shave his chest, and Monica and Rachel are eating breakfast at the foosball table.]\nRachel: All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)\nJoey and Chandler: (stopping her) Oh no-no-no-no!\nChandler: We don't know what could make this go away.\nJoey: Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!\nChandler: And no one touches the air around the TV!\nJoey: Imagine a protective p0rn bubble if you will, okay?\nMonica: Well at least, I'm going to mute it.\nJoey and Chandler: Oh no-no-no! (Monica mutes the TV and they tentatively look behind them)\nChandler: We still have p0rn.\nJoey: Hey.\nPhoebe: (entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!\nMonica: Hi!\nRachel: Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.\nPhoebe: Yeah.\nRachel: Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica right away.)\nMonica: Okay.\nPhoebe: Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She goes over and stands in front of the TV.)\nChandler: Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.\nPhoebe: You mean like a doctor?\nJoey: Pheebs! You're blocking the p0rn! Look out!\nPhoebe: Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: Hi.\nRoss: So uh, Emily just went to the airport.\nMonica: Oh. Why didn't you take her?\nRoss: Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...\nMonica: You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free p0rn!\nRoss: (Thinks about it.) Nah.\nMonica: Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?\nRoss: Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) \"This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy...\"\nMonica: (interrupting him) No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.\nRoss: And why do you care so much?\nMonica: Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!\nRoss: You had fantasies about Emily?\nMonica: No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.\nRoss: Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?\nMonica: Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!\nRoss: Ahh.\nMonica: Do you love her?\nRoss: We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?\nMonica: You love her!\nRoss: What-what is love really?\nMonica: Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, \"I love you!\" And she's gonna say, \"I love you, too!\" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.\nRoss: I am a good kisser.\nMonica: Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... (Ross looks at her.) I've been watching too much p0rn.\n[Scene: Beth Israel Medical Center, Phoebe is at her OB-GYN doing an ultrasound, Rachel is with her. We here the baby's heartbeat.]\nRachel: Is that the heartbeat?\nThe Doctor: That's it.\nPhoebe: Oh my God!\nRachel: Oh wow! This is so cool.\n(The heartbeat changes, and we hear a different one.)\nThe Doctor: Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?\nPhoebe: Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?\nThe Doctor: No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.\nPhoebe: Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!\nThe Doctor: Doctors are wrong all the time.\nPhoebe: Well, yeah.\nRachel: Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!\nThe Doctor: Definitely. (Points out each head on the ultrasound.)\nPhoebe: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!\nThe Doctor: Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.\nPhoebe: What do you know?!\n[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there, waiting to tell Frank and Alice the news.]\nAlice: (entering) Oh-oh, Phoebe!\nPhoebe: Ooh! Hi!\nAlice: Hi! (She runs over and hugs Phoebe's stomach.) So, how did it go at the doctors?\nPhoebe: Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, \"Oh, that's nice?\"\nFrank: Yes.\nPhoebe: Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.\nAlice: Three babies?\nFrank: I finally got my band!\nAlice: We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!\nPhoebe: Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.\nFrank: Why would we be freaked?\nPhoebe: No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...\nFrank: (They're less than happy now) Oh.\nAlice: Right.\nPhoebe: No, back to happy. Back to happy!\nAlice: No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.\nFrank: Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.\nAlice: No, Frank.\nPhoebe: No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?\nFrank: Yeah, refrigerator college.\nAlice: Yeah.\nFrank: Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!\nPhoebe: You can't give up on your dream.\nFrank: No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.\n[Scene: The airport, Emily is getting ready to board her flight to London.]\nTicket Agent: (On the P.A.) This is the boarding call for Flight 009.\nRoss: Emily! (Runs up.)\nEmily: Oh my God! What are you doing here? (They hug)\nRoss: I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.\nEmily: You are so sweet. (They kiss.)\nRoss: That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. (She's holding one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.\nEmily: Me too.\nTicket Agent: This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.\nEmily: Well, that' me. (They kiss again.) Here, have this. (She gives him the candy bar.) I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway. (She starts towards the jetway.)\nRoss: (stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.\nEmily: Oh. (She's shocked and hugs him.) Thank you. (She boards the plane.)\nRoss: That's no problem.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Rachel is singing some kind of song.]\nRachel: What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.\nChandler: It's the theme from Good Will Humping.\nRachel: Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.\nJoey: Yeah right.\nRachel: No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.\nChandler: Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?\nRachel: Yes!\nJoey: Yeah, he likes p0rn.\n(Rachel starts to leave.)\nMonica: Where ya going?\nRachel: I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!\nPhoebe: Hey.\nJoey: Hey!\nMonica: How did it go with Frank and Alice?\nPhoebe: Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.\nChandler: They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.\n(Ross enters.)\nMonica: Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?\nRoss: I did.\nMonica: And well, what did she say?\nRoss: Thank you.\nMonica: Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?\nRoss: She said, \"Thank you.\" I said, \"I love you.\" And she said, \"Thank you.\"\nChandler: Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?\nJoey: Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!\nRoss: What do I do now?\nJoey: You play hard to get.\nRoss: She already lives in London.\nJoey: Then you go to Tokyo.\nChandler: All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.\nMonica: It is not over! You're over!\nChandler: What?\nMonica: You know!\nChandler: Okay. (Pause) Good one.\nMonica: It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)\nRoss: Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.\n(Joey holds his fist up, and Chandler gives him two thumbs up.)\nJoey: Way to be strong, man!\n(Ross leaves, and after the door closes, Joey gives him the loser sign.)\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Joey enter having just woken up.]\nRachel: Hey!\nChandler: Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a p0rn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.\nRachel: Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?\nChandler: Because then we would be the guys who turned off free p0rn.\nPhoebe: (entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.\nMonica: Hey!\nPhoebe: Hi!\nRachel: Well, what-what 'cha got there?\nPhoebe: Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a knife and an soda can.) Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...\nChandler: Pregnant Woman Slays Four?\nMonica: Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?\nPhoebe: No!\nMonica: Are you sure?\nPhoebe: No!\nRachel: Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.\nPhoebe: No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.\nChandler: What's the second part of your plan?\nPhoebe: My Saturn dealership.\n[Scene: Ross's bedroom, he has fallen asleep waiting for Emily to call. He is awaken by the phone.]\nRoss: (Answers the phone.) Hello?\nEmily: Ross.\nRoss: Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?\nEmily: It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.\nRoss: No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.\nEmily: Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.\nRoss: Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross is relating his recent conversation with Emily to the gang.]\nRoss: She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.\nMonica: This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.\nRoss: Well...\nMonica: Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!\nRoss: I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!\nChandler: You put your fist through the wall?\nRoss: No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!\nMonica: You have to go to London!\nRoss: What?\nMonica: Yeah, you have to go fight for her!\nJoey: Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!\nMonica: When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?\nRoss: I made fun of his accent.\nMonica: You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?\nRoss: No.\nMonica: All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!\nRoss: Really?\nMonica: Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!\nRoss: All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!\nMonica: All right.\nRoss: I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.\nMonica: Okay, good luck!\n(Ross starts to leave.)\nJoey: Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Joey, and Chandler are sitting and talking as Phoebe and Rachel enter.]\nRachel: Hey!\nPhoebe: Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!\nMonica: That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?\nRachel: Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...\nPhoebe: I'm telling it! I'm telling it!\nRachel: Okay.\nPhoebe: Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?\nChandler: A place where no one will ever get out alive?\nPhoebe: No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...\nRachel: (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!\nPhoebe: The name was my favourite part!\nRachel: Well, well I can up with it!\nPhoebe: YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.\nRachel: Well, I...\n(The phone rings and Monica answers it.)\nMonica: Hello.\nRoss: (on phone) Hey.\nMonica: Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?\n[Cut to Ross in one of those British phone booths.]\nRoss: No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!\nMonica: All right. When is, when is the next flight out?\nRoss: About four hours.\nMonica: Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.\nPhoebe: Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.\nRachel: Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.\nPhoebe: Oh, that is better.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same night. There is a knock on the door and Chandler answers it to reveal Emily standing behind it.]\nChandler: Are we in London?\nMonica: What are you doing here? You can't be here!\nEmily: I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.\n(She sets her bag down on the foosball table and Joey sees the Toblerone bar sticking out of it and gazes longingly at it.)\nEmily: What?\nJoey: (pause) Nothing. No, nothing.\nEmily: I was going to call him, but...\nMonica: Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I was right! (Points to Emily) I'm right, right?\nEmily: I'd really rather talk to him.\nMonica: Oh.\nEmily: I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?\n[Cut to London, we sit Ross sitting outside Emily's apartment. We hear Emily's phone ring with amazing clarity. Apparently, sound travels quite easily through the walls of British buildings. Anyhoo, Ross looks around for the ringing phone and in the meantime Emily's answering machine picks up and once again with amazing clarity we hear Emily say...]\nEmily: Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... (Ross has moved to the window, apparently so that he can hear better.) I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.\nRoss: (yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to New York.) I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! (Realises) You can't hear me. (Goes to make his call.)\nEmily: I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. (Answers the call waiting.) Hello.\nRoss: Hi.\nEmily: Ross, I love you!\nRoss: Ohh! Thank you.\nCLOSING CREDITS\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is still watching the p0rn as Chandler enters.]\nChandler: Hey.\nJoey: Hey.\nChandler: I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.\nJoey: Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!\nChandler: What, no, \"Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?\"\nJoey: Noo! Nothing!\nChandler: Y'know what, we have to turn off the p0rn.\nJoey: I think you're right.\n(Goes over and picks up the remote.)\nChandler: All right, ready?\nJoey: One.\nChandler: Two.\nBoth: Three.\n(Chandler turns off the p0rn and sets the remote down.)\nJoey: That's kinda nice.\nChandler: Yeah, that's kinda a relief.\nJoey: Yeah.\n(Pause.)\nChandler: You wanna see if we still have it?\nJoey: Yeah.\n(Chandler turns on the TV and...)\nChandler: FREE p0rn!!!\nJoey: Yeah!!\nChandler: We have free p0rn here!!!\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

I'm busy keeping an eye on our mercurial mother.\nAmenadiel: No, it's important. I think you might be in danger.\nLucifer: Is it the Yakuza? The Nephilim? One Million Mums?\nAmenadiel: It's Maze. She's angry with you, brother.\nLucifer: Well, is it Tuesday already? Anger is Maze's default setting, sort of baked into her demon DNA.\nAmenadiel: No, this is different, Luci. I think you really need to talk to her.\nLucifer: She'll get over it; she always does. Right now, we have bigger issues to deal with, like whether or not Mum is wasting our time.\nAmenadiel: If she believes her client has found another piece of the Flaming Sword, so do I.\nLucifer: Oh, such a loyal son. But Mum hasn't adapted to this world as well as you might think. This chap could be conning her... I think I'm gonna go make sure...\nAmenadiel: She seems to be doing just fine. Charlotte puts a briefcase on the table.\nLucifer: That's not the money, is it?\nAmenadiel: Of course not. She wouldn't bring it to the meeting.\nLucifer: Oh, no. Of course not. I mean, that would be absurd, wouldn't it?\nAmenadiel: She's just showing it to him. I mean, it's not like she's gonna hand it to him before she... Gets the piece. That's great. The guy takes the money and leaves.\nLucifer: And now she's letting him leave. Marvellous. Lucifer and Amenadiel join Charlotte.\nCharlotte: Well, that went well.\nLucifer: Oh, you think so, do you?\nCharlotte: I do. He has what we need in his safe in the back room.\nLucifer: Oh.\nCharlotte: He's going to get it right now.\nLucifer: Mum, you just handed him a briefcase full of cash with no proof whatsoever he has what we need.\nCharlotte: And?\nLucifer: You've been conned.\nCharlotte: He's a client of mine, darling. I don't think he'd be that foolhardy.\nLucifer: Oh.\nCharlotte: Well, I'm sure he'll be right back... Maybe we should go check just to be sure.\nLucifer: I think that's a good idea, don't you?\nCharlotte: Oh. Lucifer, Charlotte and Amenadiel enter in the office manager of the restaurant. The man is dead.\nCharlotte: Huh. See? He didn't con me.\nLucifer: Look, instead he's dead, and someone robbed him of what's ours... Much better. Well, the good news is, after this spectacular bungling, I happen to work with a homicide detective.\nCharlotte: If you find the killer, then you'll find our piece of the Flaming Sword.\nAmenadiel: Hey, but, Mom...\nLucifer: The challenge is... Making sure we catch the case before some other detective.\nAmenadiel: But what about...\nCharlotte: I may be able to help.\nLucifer: Really? I'm all ears. Lucifer and Charlotte leave. Maze enters in Linda's practice.\nMaze: Is everything all right here?\nLinda: Yeah, everything's fine, Maze. You can, uh, you-you can put away the knives.\nNigel: We'll be in touch, Dr. Martin... Excuse me.\nLinda: Uh, Maze. Maze. Oh, my Lord.\nMaze: Who the hell was that?\nLinda: That was the chairman of the ethics review board.\nMaze: Are you okay?\nLinda: No. No, I am not. No, Maze. No, no, no, don't, don't. That won't do any good.\nMaze: What happened?\nLinda: A couple of weeks ago, I maybe, sort of... Helped Lucifer break out of a mental institution... Using my own name. It's my fault, really.\nMaze: No, it is not your fault. It is Lucifer's fault. It's always Lucifer's fault. First, I find out he's ditching me to go to Heaven, and now he's hurting you... Look, I'm gonna fix this, Linda. And then him and I are gonna have a little talk. At the station, Lucifer is waiting. Chloe is working.\nLucifer: Hey, I should get my own desk.\nChloe: Not happening.\nLucifer: Right next to yours would probably be best.\nChloe: Definitely not happening. Why are you hovering over me?\nLucifer: I'm not hovering. I'm just spending time with my partner.\nChloe: Oh, well, since you're here, why don't you help me with this paperwork. I could really get used to this, partner.\nLucifer: Right. Yes, on second thought, maybe a desk in the far corner might...\nChloe: Mm-mm.\nLucifer: Oh! Ms. Richards.\nCharlotte: Detective Decker. Just the woman I was hoping to see.\nChloe: Well, I feel the opposite. If you'll excuse me.\nCharlotte: Hear me out. A client of mine called. He sounded very worried. I think he might be in terrible danger.\nLucifer: Oh, that's awful. Detective, we should do something.\nCharlotte: He's at a bar downtown. Would you come with me and make sure that he's okay?\nChloe: Nope.\nCharlotte: Nope?\nChloe: I'm a homicide cop. I do not go around checking on worried criminals like a nanny, Charlotte. So if we're done here...\nCharlotte: I heard... Things... On a... On-on the phone call.\nChloe: Like?\nCharlotte: Fingers... Pointing.\nChloe: You heard... Fingers pointing?\nCharlotte: Very angrily. Yes... Also, a gunshot. Sounded like he was... Dying, or, um... Melting? It's hard to tell.\nChloe: Charlotte...\nLucifer: It sounds worth our time, actually.\nChloe: Agreed. Why didn't you just lead with that? Chloe, Lucifer and Charlotte enter in the crime scene.\nChloe: The lock's damaged.\nLucifer: Is it?\nChloe: Looks like you're right. He's been dead about an hour.\nLucifer: Oh? Impressive guess, Detective. Uh, I'm assuming from the... Discoloration... Well, that wasn't a complete Dumpster fire, but now that we're finished, you can see yourself out.\nCharlotte: I'll do nothing of the sort.\nLucifer: Fine. I'll show you out, if you insist.\nCharlotte: I'm not going anywhere.\nLucifer: But the detective and I have got everything handled now.\nCharlotte: This is far too important to leave to just the two of you. I will stick around.\nLucifer: Mum.\nCharlotte: Besides, we'll get to work together. Won't that be fun? Ella is here to exam the body.\nElla: We're running tests for gunshot residue and cocaine. Should have those in, like, five minutes.\nChloe: Okay. Good... Oh, Charlotte. You're still here, huh?\nCharlotte: Well, he was my client. I thought I might be of help to the case.\nLucifer: But if not, we could always get her to shoo along and we can carry on with our business.\nChloe: No. I'm sure she could be very helpful. So tell me, why does Zeke Moore, a manager at an import/export company, have you representing him?\nCharlotte: Because I'm the best.\nChloe: At getting criminals off.\nCharlotte: Well, that's not true. I haven't slept with any of my clients.\nChloe: What? You represent the worst of the worst. So why was Zeke a client?\nCharlotte: Because he works for Bianca Ruiz.\nLucifer: What? The tequila magnate?\nChloe: Bianca's tequila empire is a front. She uses the distribution routes to sell guns, drugs, and, oh, yeah, people. So we've been after her for a long time.\nCharlotte: Who do you think did this? A rival of some sort?\nChloe: Well, that's actually a good question. Ella, what do we have?\nElla: Well, no smoking gun, but poor Zeke here got shot twice. First in the thigh... Bullet winged him... And then another went through his hand hitting him in the chest. Probably trying to defend himself. Too bad you can't catch bullets.\nLucifer: Well, he can't maybe.\nChloe: I don't think this was a professional hit. Maybe a robbery gone wrong.\nCharlotte: And idea of what was taken?\nElla: Well, trace elements point to cash, cocaine, gunpowder residue, indicating weapons... All your basic bad guy stuff. No sign of forced entry, though.\nChloe: Which means the killer either knew the combination, or he just waited for the vic to open it to strike.\nElla: Mm-hmm. Hey, I got something here. Cell phone. No dust on it, so it hasn't been there long.\nChloe: Well, Zeke had his phone on him, so this one could be the killer's. Maybe he dropped it during the fight or just didn't have time to retrieve it.\nElla: Passcode protected, of course. But the home screen is... Two eyes?\nCharlotte: Human female breasts.\nLucifer: No. That is a woman's perfectly freckled rump.\nChloe: So our lead on the killer is a pair of butt-boob-eyes. It's a great start. At the station, Daniel studies Bianca Ruiz's file. Charlotte comes.\nCharlotte: Hello, Daniel.\nDaniel: What are you doing here?\nCharlotte: Ms. Ruiz there... Is my client.\nDaniel: Well, she's a real piece of work.\nCharlotte: Trying to make me jealous?\nDaniel: What do you want from me? You seduce me, you betray me, now you're back. You have to want something, I just can't figure out what.\nCharlotte: I do want something, you're right. And I'll tell you. Just somewhere private.\nDaniel: I'm not having s*x with you here.\nCharlotte: But I need something to pass the time until we get a lead.\nDaniel: I don't understand you. All right, whatever this is between us.\nCharlotte: Well, it's simple, Daniel Espinoza... I like you. Music comes from the lab.\nElla: You guys, it's a record label. The symbol on the phone we found is the label's logo.\nLucifer: And they choose to publish this music of their own free will?\nElla: It's a vanity label. It exists only to make this one guy's music.\nChloe: Okay, well, who owns it? And can you please turn it off?\nElla: Chet Ruiz.\nCharlotte: Bianca's youngest son. Half our billing goes to keeping him out of jail.\nChloe: So Bianca's own son robbed and killed one of her most loyal soldiers?\nDaniel: The files barely mention Chet. I didn't know he was actually part of the family business.\nCharlotte: He's not. Bianca tries to keep him as far away from it all as possible.\nChloe: Maybe he started to resent that, decided to make a play?\nLucifer: And then dropped his phone, proving just how right his mother was about him.\nChloe: Well, if Chet is the killer, this could be our chance to take down Bianca, as well. Cut off the head of her entire operation. This could be huge.\nElla: Yeah. Bummer is the phone proves that Chet was in the room but doesn't definitively tie him to the murder.\nChloe: Dan, why don't you work on hacking the passcode. I'll have a chat with Chet. And, Charlotte, thank you so much for your help. But now that one of your clients is our main suspect, it's best you go.\nCharlotte: I don't think I have to go quite yet.\nChloe: Maybe not, but I think you should.\nCharlotte: Bianca's having a party today. It's the launch of her new tequila. I'm sure Chet will be there, and... I'm invited.\nChloe: Why do you want to help us now?\nCharlotte: Because we all want the same thing: to find out who robbed and killed Zeke.\nDaniel: You know, Chloe, it would be a good chance for us to go undercover. Gather some intel before they even know we're onto them.\nChloe: All right.\nLucifer: Fine. Good. It's settled. The Detective and I will go, so thank you so much for your help.\nCharlotte: I don't think so. The invitation is under my name. I will go. Perhaps Detective Espinoza should join me.\nLucifer: No. Yes, that's not happening. Uh, very well. I'll go with you...\nChloe: No, I'll go with Charlotte.\nLucifer: But, Detective...\nChloe: No more argument.\nCharlotte: Very well. But I suggest you go shopping. This isn't the kind of place you can attend in pajamas.\nLucifer: This is ridiculous.\nChloe: Pajamas?\nElla: What if Ella goes to the party? That sounds like a great idea. Oh, my God. Thank you so much for thinking of me. But you know what? I'm so busy. Lucifer enters in Linda's practice. Maze is waiting for him.\nLucifer: I have been sidelined by my own mother and the Detective. It's absurd. I won't stand for it. I am gonna find a way into that party.\nMaze: Do you always whine like this? I don't know how she puts up with it.\nLucifer: Where's Dr. Linda?\nMaze: Suspended. Because of you. Because you have been a terrible, selfish friend... To her. Now you're gonna fix it.\nLucifer: Well, gladly, once I figure a way back onto the case.\nMaze: No, Lucifer. Now!\nLucifer: But I suppose they can handle things without me for the time being. What's the plan? Daniel is on the phone at the station.\nDaniel: It'll take two hours to scan the phone... I'll come to you. I'll kill some time till it's done. See you soon. Daniel sees Amenadiel.\nDaniel: Hey, man. You looking for your brother?\nAmenadiel: Or my m... Um... Charlotte? Listen, um... Are they here? Because I haven't been able to reach them.\nDaniel: No, they took off. Couple hours ago.\nAmenadiel: Of course they did. And why would they bother to let me know?\nDaniel: I could try to call them for you.\nAmenadiel: Don't worry about it, Dan. I mean, with a brother like Lucifer, I really should be used to this, right?\nDaniel: Hey. What are you doing right now? Charlotte arrives at the party.\nCharlotte: Charlotte Richards. Have you seen my plus one? She's a tired-looking blonde. Probably dressed in something freshly-plucked from the floor. Mm-mm. Hmm? Chloe enters.\nChloe: Let's get this pajama party started. Chloe and Charlotte are talking.\nChloe: I still don't understand why you're helping us. Bianca's your client.\nCharlotte: I'm not the same woman I was when she hired me.\nChloe: Hmm. Did you have a change of heart?\nCharlotte: No, the same heart. Completely different soul, though.\nChloe: Hmm. There's Chet. I'll go talk to him.\nCharlotte: You know, that's wise. You seem more his type than me, and you're not particularly intimidating, so that should help.\nChloe: Help what?\nCharlotte: Well, in seducing him, of course.\nChloe: I'm not gonna seduce him, Charlotte.\nCharlotte: Not with that posture you're not. Fine. I'll do it.\nChloe: No. No. There's gonna be no seducing. We just need to get Chet to talk, have him incriminate himself, then we can arrest him and flip him on Bianca.\nCharlotte: You expect him to betray his own mother? One that's given him everything he's ever wanted?\nChloe: Not all kids appreciate what their parents have given them.\nCharlotte: Well, that I agree with.\nChloe: I just think with a little pressure, he'll crack. Oh, bodyguard. Maybe he's not as easy to get to as I thought.\nCharlotte: Why would an overprotective mother bring her murderous son to a tequila-fuelled party?\nChloe: Well, if her son killed Zeke, she has no idea... Okay. I've got an idea. Maze and Lucifer are talking to the chairman of the ethics review board.\nMaze: Dr. Linda Martin is an amazing therapist and an incredible woman. You can't do this to her.\nNigel: Well, I'm afraid that she brought this on herself. So, unless there's something... Specific that you can tell me, there's very little that I can do.\nMaze: Hmm. Well, how about proof of all the good she's done? Like this guy. Lucifer Morningstar.\nLucifer: Oh, that's quite flattering.\nMaze: The worst patient anyone could ask for. He is a back-stabbing, selfish, narcissistic little devil. He's greedy...\nNigel: Is there a-a point to this?\nLucifer: Yes, I'm wondering the same thing.\nMaze: The point is, despite all of that, she went out of her way to help him.\nLucifer: Yeah, she's right. The doctor has seen a side to me that I hide because it's, well, terrifying. But she accepted me nonetheless, and she's helped me through issues that I thought insurmountable.\nNigel: I appreciate the testimonial, and I will include it into the notes.\nMaze: That's it?\nNigel: Unless you have more evidence to submit.\nLucifer: Well, she's generous. As a, as a therapist, as a lover, a friend...\nNigel: Wait. You slept with your therapist.\nLucifer: What? O-only in the beginning. Then she decided that I shouldn't pay for therapy with s*x. So, such strong morals, don't you think?\nMaze: Let's go!\nLucifer: What the...? Oh, no, no, she saved my life. I mean, granted, she killed me first, but I did ask her.\nMaze: Oh, my God. Lucifer. At the party, Charlotte goes to speak with Bianca.\nBianca Ruiz: We actually have been trying to get the formula for... Charlotte. Excuse me. Oh. So glad you can make it. How are the children?\nCharlotte: They're angels. But speaking of children... What did Chet do now?\nBianca Ruiz: Run out on another tab?\nCharlotte: The police suspect him of killing Zeke Moore.\nBianca Ruiz: That's impossible.\nCharlotte: I have it from a very good source.\nBianca Ruiz: I'll get to the bottom of it. Thank you, Charlotte.\nCharlotte: As always. Of course.\nBianca Ruiz: Enjoy. Bianca is going to speak with her son.\nBianca Ruiz: What did you do?\nChet Ruiz: What could I do? You won't let me drink, my bank account's pretty low lately...\nBianca Ruiz: Zeke Moore. What did you do?\nChet Ruiz: I took care of a problem. You're welcome.\nBianca Ruiz: You don't work for me.\nChet Ruiz: But I should. Look what I can do.\nBianca Ruiz: Yeah, remove one of my best earners?\nChet Ruiz: You see, this is why you need me, Ma. I found out that Zeke was building up his own business. Smuggling up rare artifacts on the side.\nBianca Ruiz: And I was making 30%.\nChet Ruiz: Oh. Well, I would have known that if you had just given me...\nBianca Ruiz: How do the police know it was you?\nChet Ruiz: I may have... Dropped my phone.\nBianca Ruiz: Chet, what was on your phone? Let's go somewhere quieter.\nChet Ruiz: No, Mom. Mom, Mom. They go apart.\nBianca Ruiz: The whole business?\nChet Ruiz: I was just trying to learn how the financial part worked, Ma. You know, prove to you I could be a part of this.\nBianca Ruiz: So you saved it on your phone, which the police now have.\nChet Ruiz: Don't worry. I'm already taking care of it. Won't be a problem... What? Bianca Ruiz stops Chloe who was trying to leave.\nBianca Ruiz: Hello. Daniel and Amenadiel are having a drink in a bar.\nAmenadiel: Improv? Really?\nDaniel: Come on, man, you promised me you wouldn't laugh. I went through a lot this last year. And improv sort of helped me reorient myself.\nAmenadiel: How?\nDaniel: Well, it took stepping outside of myself to figure out who I really was. You know, stop defining myself by other people... Chloe. Lucifer.\nAmenadiel: I see. So you think I'm defining myself by my brother, yeah?\nDaniel: Well, I know from experience, the dude casts a pretty big-ass shadow.\nAmenadiel: Well, if there is one constant in the universe, it's that Lucifer's the favourite. No matter what I do. No matter how hard I work or how much he screws up...It's never gonna change.\nDaniel: You guys must have competed over everything, huh?\nAmenadiel: I mean, he would never admit it, right? But yeah. Yeah, everything.\nDaniel: Even women? Eh, I just noticed that you and Lucifer have a weird relationship with Charlotte Richards. I just thought maybe you guys...\nAmenadiel: No, Dan, we are not competing over Charlotte. Trust me. At least, not in the way you think. And if we are, well, obviously I lost. Because I'm here, with you. No offense.\nDaniel: Yeah, none taken. Oh, man. They couldn't crack the passcode. But, uh, for what it's worth, I like you a hell of a lot more than I like your brother. At the party, Bianca asks some questions to Chloe.\nBianca Ruiz: I know everyone here except you. What are you doing here?\nChloe: I, uh... I'm... Uh, was... I came because, well... I love your son's music. Hi, Chet. Chet, you're so good. You're amazing.\nBianca Ruiz: Oh, please. I've seen the sales. Nobody actually listens to that... Stuff.\nChloe: Oh, I listen to it, big-time. Chloe starts to sing.\nBianca Ruiz: I've heard enough.\nChloe: Yeah.\nGuard: That's enough, ma'am.\nChloe: Chet, you're so good. You're dope!\nGuard: Let's go.\nChloe: I love you. I...\nChet Ruiz: I love you more. Chloe phones Daniel.\nChloe: Dan. Hey. Look, that phone... I think it is way more important than we thought. It might be the key to taking down Bianca. Maze and Lucifer are walking in the street.\nLucifer: Great. Now that we've solved that, I can get back to the case and... Maze hits Lucifer in the belly.\nLucifer: Ooh! God! What?!\nMaze: What? You just made everything worse. Why am I surprised? Just leave. Since that's been your plan all along anyway.\nLucifer: Is that what all this has been about? Amenadiel told you about our trip back to Heaven, didn't he?\nMaze: Don't you blame him. You... She hits him again.\nLucifer: Aah!\nMaze: Should have told me.\nLucifer: Well, if you understood the full picture... She punches him in the face.\nLucifer: Oh! Stop hitting me.\nMaze: Then explain.\nLucifer: Well, I'd like to, but you have a tendency to get emotional about things. She punches him in the face again.\nLucifer: Aah! Case in point.\nMaze: So I needed to be controlled, is that it? What the hell am I, Lucifer... A pawn in some plan of yours?\nLucifer: No, I wouldn't put it like that.\nMaze: Of course you wouldn't, because that would actually require you understanding how you affect people. How you hurt them. She hits him in the nuts.\nLucifer: Oh! Aah! You seem to be the one doing the hurting at the moment.\nMaze: You don't care about anyone other than yourself. Unless they can be of use to you. Sound familiar?\nLucifer: Tread very carefully, Maze.\nMaze: You're just like your parents. They fight.\nLucifer: Aah!\nMaze: Aah!\nLucifer: Oh! Maybe... Maybe we should just take a time-out so that... You can catch your breath.\nMaze: Yeah, so you can catch your breath. And then, I'll get back to kicking your ass.\nLucifer: See, now... I had no idea that you were this mad at me.\nMaze: You were gonna leave me.\nLucifer: I would never do that.\nMaze: But you told Amenadiel and your mom that y... You were going with them to Heaven.\nLucifer: Well, I didn't say how long for. Huh? Or what I was gonna do when I got there.\nMaze: You're playing your own angle... And you didn't tell me... Because you needed me to be angry with you so you could sell your story.\nLucifer: Exactly! So, all this... Was for nothing.\nMaze: Lucifer, that's even worse. At the station, Ella, Chloe and Daniel are talking about the phone.\nElla: This phone could be the key to taking down the entire Ruiz empire.\nDaniel: Yeah, but how do we crack it if cyber couldn't even do it?\nElla: Time. That idiot didn't install a program that can remotely wipe the phone. And it's an older phone with just a four-digit code.\nDaniel: So, what, we just keep trying till we get in? How long will that take?\nElla: There are only 10,000 options. Well, actually, 9,996 now... I took a couple stabs. So, hey, making progress. I would say maybe a month.\nDaniel: Well, we can't arrest 'em till we know what's on that phone. And if they decide to make a run for it...\nChloe: All right. Let's just try to speed it up. Let's look into Chet's background, let's try and come up with number combinations that might be meaningful to him, all right? Let's go. Maze and Lucifer are at Linda's practice.\nLinda: Did you guys... Kill the chairman of the review board? Please tell me you didn't kill him. Not that he didn't deserve it, the smug, insufferable...\nLucifer: No, no. No one's dead. We did this to each other. Though... When it comes to your case, I fear I may have, um... Complicated things.\nMaze: Lucifer told him you used to screw. Among other things.\nLinda: Oh? Oh. Well, I guess that's that.\nLucifer: No, that isn't that. I want to know why she's still upset with me.\nLinda: Since I'm not currently a practicing doctor of psychiatry, I don't have to lead you on this path of realization; I can just tell you. Maze is pissed at you because you used her.\nLucifer: Sure. But for the greater good of our debauchery here in L.A.\nLinda: Did you even once think of how this affected her?\nLucifer: Of course I did. Thought about how she might ruin everything by disembowelling my mum or castrating my brother.\nLinda: I meant her feelings.\nLucifer: What?\nLinda: She thought... You abandoned her. That you didn't care how that affected her.\nLucifer: But those sort of things never bothered her be... Maze is crying.\nLucifer: Before. Oh... Mazikeen. I didn't realize... I should have realized.\nLinda: Well, my work here is done... Literally. So, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to find a very stiff martini.\nMaze: Linda... I'll take care of this. I promise.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBianca enters in Charlotte's office.\nCharlotte: Bianca. Has something happened?\nBianca Ruiz: Yes. My son robbed and killed Zeke, as you know. But then he showed me what Zeke was smuggling. And for whom. Now I have it. And I think it's very important to you, isn't it?\nCharlotte: It is.\nBianca Ruiz: Then let's make a deal. I'll give it to you if you get my son's phone from the police.\nCharlotte: That's not possible.\nBianca Ruiz: You'll find a way. Otherwise, I'll make sure that what you want... Disappears forever. Ella is trying to find the passcode of Chet's phone. Charlotte enters.\nElla: Birthday reverse. Nope. Double 69. Oddly relieved that's not it.\nCharlotte: Ms. Lopez. We haven't really had the chance to meet.\nElla: I know. I've been looking forward to a formal \"hey-ya.\"\nCharlotte: S... Uh... Uh, no, I see you're still working on the phone. I knew Chet well. Perhaps I could borrow it, maybe try some combinations?\nElla: I see through you... I know you are waiting around for my boy Dan.\nCharlotte: Oh. Caught me red-handed.\nElla: And even though most everybody is all like, \"She a shark, those dead eyes, don't trust her,\" when I look at you... I see a light.\nCharlotte: Did my bandage come undone?\nElla: So, for now, benefit of the doubt. But if you ever hurt Dan again, I'll have someone break your legs. Ella's phone rings.\nElla: Oh, that's my brother. I've been trying to get ahold of him forever. Can you watch the phone?\nCharlotte: Sure.\nElla: Thanks. See? Light. Charlotte takes the phone and she's about to leave the lab, but Chloe is here.\nChloe: Start talking. Lucifer is playing the piano, Chloe enters.\nLucifer: Ah!\nChloe: What happened to you?\nLucifer: Oh, this. It's just a little fisticuffs between friends.\nChloe: I just had a very enlightening conversation with Charlotte Richards.\nLucifer: Ah. Well, I've had my fill of enlightening conversations for today, thank you.\nChloe: Lucifer, she told me who she really is, and how you two are related.\nLucifer: I somehow doubt that.\nChloe: No, it all makes sense. Why you were so disgusted when I suggested you two had slept together. Why you act so weird around her in general.\nLucifer: She... Really told you. What did she tell you?\nChloe: That she's your father's ex.\nLucifer: Right, yes, no. That's-that's true.\nChloe: Right, yeah. I mean, the way she talked about your dad and-and what he put her through.\nLucifer: Mm-hmm. Betrayal, torture, Hell, et cetera. All true.\nChloe: Mm-hmm. I just cannot imagine raising kids with someone like that.\nLucifer: Sympathy for the Goddess, Detective?\nChloe: Why didn't you just tell me she was your step-mom?\nLucifer: Well, it didn't seem that simple to explain. I mean, how did this all come about, anyway?\nChloe: Well... I... I caught Charlotte trying to steal evidence for Bianca Ruiz.\nLucifer: What? Why would she do that?\nChloe: Well, apparently Bianca figured out that Charlotte and I were working together at the sting. Bianca threatened Charlotte's family. I mean, she threatened you if she didn't help.\nLucifer: Well, that sounds plausible, yes.\nChloe: I don't know. Something about it doesn't feel right. I don't know if I can trust her.\nLucifer: Well, I mean, I know I'm biased, but one thing's for certain, Detective: Charlotte Richards will stop at nothing to protect her children... You can trust that.\nChloe: Hmm. Charlotte is in Bianca's office.\nBianca Ruiz: Did you bring me what I asked for?\nCharlotte: Mm. As promised.\nBianca Ruiz: Make sure it's real. That it wasn't cloned. A guy takes the phone.\nBianca Ruiz: To the things a mother will do for her children.\nCharlotte: I'll drink to that. Chloe and Lucifer are listening to the conversation.\nBianca Ruiz: I can't even count the times that Chet has come close to destroying everything I've built.\nCharlotte: Children always find new ways to test us.\nLucifer: She's talking about Amenadiel.\nCharlotte: Put us through... Hell.\nLucifer: That one's me.\nBianca Ruiz: And yet we still protect them.\nCharlotte: Always.\nBianca Ruiz: Now for your side of the bargain. Charlotte pours her drink on the bug.\nChloe: We lost the feed. She's up to something.\nLucifer: Well, no, no, no. She may have just shorted the bug.\nChloe: No. Charlotte Richards is either screwing us over or she's in trouble. Guys, get ready to go in. And she better be in trouble. In the office, Bianca gives Charlotte a key.\nBianca Ruiz: This opens a safety deposit box. Inside you'll find what Zeke was smuggling for you.\nCharlotte: This isn't what we agreed to. How do I know you'll hold up your end of the deal?\nBianca Ruiz: Because I always do. And quite honestly, I don't see why you put so much value in... The cops enter in the office.\nCops: Freeze! See your hands!\nChloe: LAPD. Bianca Ruiz, you're under arrest.\nBianca Ruiz: This is absurd. Charlotte. Charlotte.\nCharlotte: Will no longer be representing you.\nBianca Ruiz: You're making a terrible mistake... Don't touch me.\nLucifer: Charlotte, are you okay?\nCharlotte: Yes.\nChloe: Lucifer, don't. Step away. I need to search her.\nLucifer: Well, I don't think that's necessary, Detective.\nChloe: Well, I do.\nCharlotte: It's okay, son.\nLucifer: Fine.\nChloe: Arms out.\nCharlotte: Hmm. Oh, you're being incredibly thorough... I like it.\nChloe: She's clean.\nLucifer: Well, I told you, Detective, she's got nothing to hide.\nOfficer: The phone was still unlocked. We have everything.\nChloe: Seems like we do. Let's, uh... Lucifer had the key. Charlotte, Amenadiel and Lucifer are at the penthouse.\nCharlotte: A book? That's what Zeke smuggled for me? Is this a joke?\nLucifer: Well, if it were, I would have chosen something funnier, like Douglas Adams or Freud.\nCharlotte: Are you certain... That this is all that was in the safety deposit box? Well, how is a book supposed to ignite the sword?\nAmenadiel: Maybe it's an instruction manual.\nCharlotte: In an ancient language I can't read. Wonderful. Here.\nLucifer: Wh... I can't read it.\nCharlotte: But you speak every language.\nLucifer: Speak, not read. I've always found tongues much more useful than books. So whatever language this is...\nAmenadiel: It's Sumerian. Unlike some of us who had everything handed to him, I actually spent my youth studying.\nCharlotte: Excellent. My smart boy. How-how quickly can you translate it?\nAmenadiel: Um, should only take me a few days.\nCharlotte: Days? I don't have that kind of time.\nLucifer: Mum, why have you got your knickers in such a twist?\nAmenadiel: Is there a reason why you're in such a rush lately?\nCharlotte: I-I'm just anxious to see the rest of the family. Please start translating. Charlotte leaves.\nAmenadiel: There's something going on with her.\nLucifer: Yeah. Or it's just that time of the millennium... What? Maze arrives to the chairman of the ethics review board's office.\nNigel: Excuse me.\nMaze: Not this time. She pushes him in the office. Daniel goes to speak with Chloe.\nDaniel: Hey.\nChloe: Hey.\nDaniel: Congrats on nabbing Queen Tequila.\nChloe: Well, Chet's still out there, so this isn't over until I find him.\nDaniel: You and Charlotte Richards... That is the most awkward team-up of the century.\nChloe: Actually, it wasn't as bad as I expected. I learned a lot of eye-opening things about her. That's for sure. Like her being Lucifer's step-mom. Had no idea...\nDaniel: Wait a minute. She... Step-mom?\nChloe: Yeah. Yes.\nDaniel: That makes a weird amount of sense, actually.\nChloe: Dan, I want you to be careful with her. There's something about her I don't trust.\nDaniel: I'm gonna be fine, Chloe.\nChloe: Wait. One more thing.\nDaniel: Yeah.\nChloe: If you married her, you'd kind of be like Lucifer's dad.\nDaniel: Oh, my God.\nChloe: Right? It's so, so messed up. Charlotte is waiting for Chet Ruiz in her office.\nChet Ruiz: I'm glad you agreed to meet me.\nCharlotte: Well, of course I did. I knew that book couldn't be it... Well, come on. Hand it over. I need what Zeke really smuggled... Now. Chet draws a knife.\nCharlotte: Mm. A knife. We already have... He stabs Charlotte.\nChet Ruiz: My life is ruined! I don't want to go to prison. This is all your fault! Charlotte takes off the knife and her light burns Chet. He's dead. At the penthouse, Amenadiel translates the book.\nLucifer: Who knew translating could be so exhausting.\nAmenadiel: Listen, I think I found something.\nLucifer: Huh?\nAmenadiel: God shattered the Flaming Sword into three distinct pieces. \"The Blade of Death.\"\nLucifer: Azrael's.\nAmenadiel: \"The Medallion of Life.\"\nLucifer: Johnson's belt buckle.\nAmenadiel: And the key that binds them all together.\nLucifer: Well, keys don't bind, they unlock. I think someone needs to go back to translation school.\nAmenadiel: And guess who has the key.\nLucifer: Well, don't leave me in suspense. Who is it, brother?\nAmenadiel: It says that God entrusted the key to his favourite son... Of course he gave it to you... It's always you, isn't it?\nLucifer: Well, what are you talking about? The only keys I've got are these.\nAmenadiel: What else did you bring with you to Earth, Luci? Your ring. I've never seen you without it; maybe that's the key.\nLucifer: Well, the key to completing my ensemble maybe.\nAmenadiel: Here. Try and attach your ring to this.\nLucifer: Brother.\nAmenadiel: Just do it. And we'll confirm what we already know.\nLucifer: Brother...\nAmenadiel: That Father's favourite, despite everything that you have done, is and always has been you.\nLucifer: Look down. Is that the key around your neck or are you just happy to see me? He entrusted it... To you, brother.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

I'm excited to finally meet your girlfriend.\nSheldon: Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.\nHoward: Since when do you read social science?\nSheldon: I go to the bathroom like everybody else.\nRaj: Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?\nLeonard: Yeah, you didn't lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.\nRaj: You guys kiss and hold hands.\nLeonard: I've seen him do it. It's not romantic.\nRaj: Look, I'm not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he's in a relationship.\nLeonard: What happens if she doesn't like us?\nRaj: Well, hey, you're my dear friends.

In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.\nBernadette: Long story short, they have seven HBOs.\n(knocking)\nRaj: Hey, guys.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: Emily, you know almost everybody here.\nEmily: Hi.\nRaj: And this is Leonard, this is Penny.\nEmily: Oh, it's so nice to meet you.\nLeonard: Nice to finally meet you, too.\nPenny: Hi.\nEmily: Hello.\nLeonard: Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.\nRaj: I told you she exists.\nPenny: Hey, I hear you're a dermatologist.\nEmily: Uh, yeah, I'm a resident at Huntington Hospital.\nSheldon: Oh, I like their emergency room.

Maybe she can practice on you some time.\nPenny: Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.\nEmily: Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine.\nSheldon: I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?\nEmily: Um, okay, I guess.\nAmy: I'm with him three years, nothing. She's with him two minutes, and he's taking his pants off.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Penny's apartment ]\nBernadette: Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?\nPenny: I don't know. I kind of got the sense she didn't like me.\nBernadette: Did she say she didn't like you?\nPenny: Of course not. No one ever says they don't like you straight to your face.\nAmy: We have led different lives.\nBernadette: You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?\nPenny: It's just this vibe I got.\nBernadette: I'm sure you're worried about nothing.\nPenny: Yeah. You're probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn't like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.\nBernadette: Really?\nPenny: Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out.\nBernadette: When you go to Emily's office to practice, you'll see. It's fine.\nPenny: Yeah, I hope you're right.\nAmy: You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?\nPenny: Yeah.\nAmy: I'd say it now, but look at those cheekbones.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Capital Comics ]\n(rock music playing)\nSheldon: I miss Stuart's place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig's house?\nHoward: Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.\nLeonard: Okay, him I believe because he's an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old's tee shirt. But you're just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.\nHoward: Yes, I am. You know, I can't even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?\nRaj: You know, he might not reopen. He didn't get a lot of money from the insurance company.\nSheldon: Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it's those dad-gum insurance companies.\nLeonard: Why? Because they won't get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?\nHoward: All I know is, he's got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn't he just use an angora rabbit?\nSheldon: For starters, they shed and bite.\nLeonard: Hey, here's a thought. Why don't we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?\nRaj: So, we'd be, like, owners of a comic book store?\n(all chuckling)\nLeonard: It's kind of a dream come true.\nHoward: That does sound fun.\nRaj: Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.\nSheldon: I'll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.\nLeonard: It's not that bad.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Emily's surgery ]\nPenny: Hey.\nEmily: Hi.\nPenny: Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.\nEmily: Sure.\nPenny: Um, I brought coffee. I wasn't sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.\nEmily: Thanks. If we could get started. I'm a little busy.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra.\nEmily: Great.\nPenny: So, Femevra's triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.\nEmily: All right.\nPenny: It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.\nEmily: Funny.\nPenny: Okay, I'm sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.\nEmily: No, it's fine.\nPenny: Are you sure, because it doesn't seem fine?\nEmily: Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a problem.\nPenny: Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?\nEmily: Look, it's nothing. It's just, Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.\nPenny: What? Oh, why would he say that?\nEmily: Did it not happen?\nPenny: Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a hook-up.\nEmily: Did you kiss?\nPenny: Yeah.\nEmily: Were you naked?\nPenny: Yeah.\nEmily: So, it was a hook-up.\nPenny: No. Yeah.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ The apartment ]\nSheldon: So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?\nLeonard: Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.\nHoward: You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.\nRaj: Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?\nSheldon: Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?\nHoward: Toy stores, puppet shows.\nLeonard: Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?\nRaj: We are now.\nPenny: You told Emily we hooked up?\nRaj: Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.\nPenny: Why would you say that?\nRaj: We were having a conversation about past lovers.\nPenny: We weren't lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn't sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn't you just leave me out of it?\nRaj: Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?\nLeonard: Why say it?\nPenny: Yes.\nRaj: Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we're playing fast and loose with the word list.\nPenny: Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.\nRaj: Great.\nSheldon: On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you're going to lose next.\nRaj: You, okay? It's you. You're, you're next.\nSheldon: No. You're crazy about me.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Penny's apartment ]\nPenny: I don't know what Emily's so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.\nAmy: Hmm-hmm.\nPenny: Almost everyone has a past.\nBernadette: Come on, look how pretty you are. I'm sure this isn't the first girl to hate you.\nPenny: It's not.\nBernadette: And I'm sure you can turn it around.\nPenny: How? You can't force someone to like you.\nAmy: What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you're in her home, you're eating her food, drinking her wine.\nPenny: No, that won't work.\nAmy: You're right. Cheers.\nBernadette: Oh, I know. Why don't you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?\nPenny: What?\nBernadette: Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you'd be selling Penny. it's cute.\nPenny: It's stupid.\nBernadette: Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn't crap all over their ideas.\nAmy: I'm gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn't I? I mean, we go way back.\nPenny: Oh, my God. I didn't used to like you.\nAmy: Shh. Amy's here now.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Capital Comics ]\nSheldon: You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store.\nHoward: We'll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.\nSheldon: And we'll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn't a library, buy it or get out.\nHoward: You say things like that all the time.\nSheldon: Yes, but as a store owner, I'll finally have a good comeback to, You don't work here, shut up.\nLeonard: Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?\nHoward: Yeah.\nLeonard: Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?\nSheldon: I'm sure she did.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: Because if she hadn't, she'd still be wading through the list.\nLeonard: Will you stay out of this?\nSheldon: If only Penny had said that once in a while.\nHoward: Hey, what difference does it make? You're the one she wants to marry.\nLeonard: That's true.\nHoward: Yeah, and I'm not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.\nSheldon: Yeah, he's right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.\nLeonard: Why are you even part of this conversation? You don't know anything about women.\nSheldon: I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée, I'd ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.\nHoward: He's right.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ The stairwell ]\nLeonard: There's something I wanted to run past you.\nPenny: What's up?\nLeonard: Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart's comic book store. Is that okay?\nPenny: Why are you asking me?\nLeonard: Well, you know, we're engaged, and it's kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.\nPenny: Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Huh.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Howard and Bernadette's apartment ]\nHoward: Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity.\nBernadette: Nope.\nHoward: But you didn't hear what it was.\nBernadette: I know.\nHoward: Oh, come on.\nBernadette: Fine. What is it?\nHoward: It's to help reopen the comic book store.\nBernadette: Nope.\nHoward: Well, hear me out.\nBernadette: Howard, you know we're saving up for a house.\nHoward: I know, but all the guys are doing it. We're splitting it four ways, so it's really not that much money.\nBernadette: It just seems like a risky investment.\nHoward: I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.\nBernadette: Oh. Howie, I had no idea.\nHoward: Well, I don't like to talk about it.\nBernadette: Oh, baby. That story's made up, isn't it?\nHoward: That's how much buying a comic book store means to me.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ The apartment ]\nSheldon: I'd like your honest opinion on something.\nAmy: Of course.\nSheldon: Now, before I start, I need you to know that I'm very excited about this, and anything you say that isn't enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind.\nAmy: I'm feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Perfect. Now, I'm considering investing in Stuart's comic book store.\nAmy: Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: Then I think it's a terrific idea.\nSheldon: Great. Wait till you hear about our van.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Penny's apartment ]\n(knocking)\nRaj: Hey.\nPenny: Hi.\nRaj: Thanks for inviting us over.\nPenny: Oh, thank you for coming.\nEmily: Uh, listen, Penny, before you start, I just want to apologise for being so rude the other day in my office.\nPenny: No, no. No need to apologise.\nRaj: Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?\nPenny: Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.\nRaj: It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.\nPenny: Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I'm just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.\nEmily: Mm. I'd like that, too. Yeah, I thought I'd be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are.\nPenny: Oh, that's so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.\nRaj: It's true, you're both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I've been alone most of my adult life.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Mrs Wolowitz's house ]\nStuart: So, what brings you by?\nHoward: Well, I don't need a reason, it's my house.\nStuart: Technically, it's your mom's house, but we certainly want you to feel welcome.\nHoward: I'm always welcome.\nStuart: Mm, just try and call first.\nBernadette: Okay, let's get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions.\nStuart: Oh. I appreciate the offer, but actually your mother already gave me the money.\nHoward: What?\nStuart: Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.\nHoward: Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I'm your bubala. You can't have more than one bubala.\nStuart: I don't know who he's talking to. She's at Target, buying me shirts.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Penny's apartment ]\nRaj: I'm so glad we could work this all out.\nPenny: Yeah, me, too.\nEmily: You know, we should have dinner one night with you and Leonard.\nPenny: Oh, we would love that.\nRaj: Great.\n(both chuckle)\nPenny: Okay, good night, guys.\nEmily: All right, night.\nPenny: Bye.\nEmily and Penny (simultaneously): I hate her.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ The apartment ]\nRaj: I'm really disappointed we're not gonna have our own comic book store.\nLeonard: I know. I was looking forward to it.\nSheldon: It would've been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace.\nHoward: With comfy seats.\nRaj: And snacks.\nSheldon: Well, I guess it was too good to be true.\nLeonard: Yeah.\n(all sigh)\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

[Sneezes] What are you doing?\nMorty: Um... wait, wait. Were you about to talk... to her?\nMorty: Well... I mean, I was thinking about it. Dude, stay in your league. Look at how hot she is. You don't see me going to a bigger school in a wealthier district and hitting on their prettiest girl. Gee, thanks, brad. I throw balls far. You want good words? Date a languager.\nJerry: Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after brad's out of shape.\nMorty: [sighing] you're missing the point, dad. I don't want girls. I want Jessica.\nJerry: Ah, well, I remember feeling that way about a young lady named \"your mom,\" and that's not an urban diss. Your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her.\nI thought Rick: \"i should get her pregnant, and then she'll have to marry me.\"\nJerry: I beg your pardon, Rick inappropriate.\nRick: Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school. I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty. His marriage is hanging from a thread.\nJerry: My marriage is fine, thank you.\nRick: Jerry, it's your house whatever you say it is is how it is but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care, and even inoticed.\nMorty: Come on, Rick! Don't talk about my parents like that.\nRick: Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call \"love\" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above.

It's gonna be great.\nMorty: Hey, listen, Rick. Y-y-you know how you said that, you know, love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier? Well, I was thinking, you know, w-w could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing? You know, like, maybe make some sort of love potion or something?\nRick: Morty, that's such a poor use of my time. It's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver.\nMorty: You know what? No, Rick! I'm not gonna hand you the screwdriver. I-I'm not gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick! I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. W-w-w-w-w-what about me, Rick? W-w-w-w-why can't you just help me out once once for once?\nRick: [groans] you're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass. [Clears throat] Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. Do you know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is? It's a it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical released in a mammal's brain, you know, that makes it fall in love. All right, Morty, I just got to [burps] combine it with some of your dna.\nMorty: Oh, well, okay.\n[Zipper opens]\nRick: A hair, Morty.\nI need one of your hairs. This isn't \"game of thrones.\"\nMorty: Ow!\nRick: All right, Morty. Whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Are you happy now, Morty?\nMorty: Heck, yeah! Thank you, grandpa Rick. Hey, there's no... dangers or anything, or side effects, right?\nRick: W-w-w-what am i, a hack? Go nuts, Morty. It's foolproof. Eh, unless she has the flu.\nJerry: Beth, do y-you still love me?\nBeth: Ugh, what kind of question is that?\nJerry: The \"yes or no\" kind?\n[Laughs nervously]\nBeth: Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?\nJerry: Yes.\nBeth: Are you gonna build them?\nJerry: No.\nBeth: Then what good was the \"yes\"?\nJerry: Wait, i-is loving me the house or the homeless people?\nBeth: Loving you is work, Jerry hard work, like building a homeless shelter nobody wants to say no to doing it, but some people put the work in.\nSo, what do you say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me?\nJerry: Sort of.\nBeth: Then I obviously sort of love you, don't I?

I love him so much, I want to make love to him and then eat his head. I love him more than you do, harold! You wish, you stupid bitch! Morty's mine! Morty's mine! Meant to be together!\n[Speaking arabic]\nMorty!\n[Speaking arabic]\n[banging on door]\nWhere is Morty?\nSummer: [screams]\n[conversing in native language]\nMorty: Oh, my god, Rick.\nThe whole world is infected!\nRick: Yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread. I've really outdone myself.\nMorty: Outdone yourself?! W-w a-are are you kidding me, Rick? This is not okay! Not only do they all want to have s*x with me, but, you know, now they want to eat me afterwards!\nRick: Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking. Mantises are they opposite of voles? I mean, obviously, dna's a little more complicated than that. You know what, though, Morty? This right here's gonna do the tRick, baby. It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur. Should add up to normal humanity.\nMorty: I don't that doesn't make any sense, Rick. How does that add up to normal humanity?\nMorty: What, Morty, you want me to show you my math? I'm sorry a-are you the scientist or are you the kid that wanted to get laid? [Exhales deeply] Well, I'm glad we saved all those horses, but I'm almost sorry we're finished.\nBeth: Yes, it's satisfying work. Unh-unh-unh, it's, uh it's more than the work. I love being in that sterilized room, sealed off from the world. It's the only time I can really think... and feel.\n[Slow music plays]\nBeth: Hmm, uh, what are you doing?\nI'm playing african dream pop. What do youdo after a long night?\n[Click]\nBeth: Oh, ha, um, hey, I b I'd better get going.\nUm, Jerry's been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff. Beth...\nBeth: What is it, davin? Just once, I'd like to know [sneezes] ...w-w-what it was like to give your son a bath.\nBeth: What?! What does Morty's skin smell like? How soft... [grunts] How soft are his privates?\nBeth: Let go of me, davin!\n[Glass shatters]\n[roars] Take me to Morty.\nJerry: [grunts] You're not Morty.\nJerry: No. I'm mr. Crowbar, and this is my friend, who is also a crowbar. That's... stupid.\nJerry: [grunting] Yeah? Well, look where being smart got you.\nBeth: Jerry! Thank god!\nJerry: God? God's turning people into insect monsters, Beth. I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me.\nBeth: Thank you, Jerry. Thank you.\nRick: Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once I pull this lever, it's all back to normal.\nMorty: Just do it already.\nRick: Well, technically, Morty, there's no rush. I mean, you know, o-once it's fixed, it's done. It's fixed. You know, we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit. I mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy it is. I mean, Morty, w-w-when's the next time you're gonna see something like this? I mean, soak it in, you know? It's it's pretty neat. It's pretty interesting.\nMorty: That's it, Rick! I'm pulling the lever.\n[Grunts]\nRick: W-what do we have here, Morty?\nLooks like I was right and you were wrong, huh? I-i-i-i-i-i-i bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh? I-i-i bet you feel like the world's smallest man that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty.\nMorty: Oh, Rick, something's not right.\nRick: [sighs] Yeah, you. You're not right ever.\nMorty: No, no! Look, you idiot!\n[All screaming]\n[all speaking native language]\n[all groaning]\n[all ululating]\nRick: Bet you're loving this, Morty.\nThis must be the best day of your life. You get to be the mayor of I told you town.\n[Slurps]\nYou're welcome.\n[Slurps]\nJerry: Hold on.\nBeth: [whimpers]\n[engine revs, tires squeal]\n[gun cocks]\nJerry: I wish that shotgun was my pen1s.\nBeth: If it were, you could call me ernest hemingway.\nJerry: I don't get it, and I don't need to.\n[Both moaning]\nSummer: Mom! Dad!\nBoth: Summer!\nBeth: [sighs]\nJerry: Where's Morty?\nSummer: I don't know.\nDo you think grandpa Rick had something to do with this?\nJerry: It's not fair to assume that, Summer.\nBeth: Oh, not fair? Give me a break. He is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother. A real man stands by his woman.\n[Both moaning]\nSummer: Tchoo.\nTchoo-tchoo-tchoo. Tchoo-tchoo.\nRick: Boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn't i? We got a whole planet of cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty. A-at least they're not in love with you anymore, though. That's a huge step in the right direction.\nMorty: Oh, my god! It's a living nightmare! How could you be so irresponsible, Rick?\nRick: Me irresponsible?! You all I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, Morty! You're the one who wanted to be wanted me to buckle down and make you up a... roofie-juice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your school. I mean, g w-w-w-w-w w are you kidding me, Morty? You're gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y-y-y-y-you're a little creep, Morty. Y-you're a you're you're you're just a little creepy... creep person.\nMorty: All right, fine. I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum. I'm willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick. But I'll tell you something you know what? You got to accept your part of the blame! I'm not the one who fouled up the serum! I'm not the one who who who who haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch of cronenbergs! You got to fix this, Rick!\nMorty: All right, all right, Morty. You know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here, but I do have one emergency solution that I can use that'll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking. Here, Morty, put this on while I do a little bit of scouting.\n[Birds chirping]\nMorty: Wow, Rick, I got to say you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time.\nI mean, i-i really thought that the whole place was gonna be messed up for good, but here, you did it y-y-you you you figured out that crazy solution, like you always do. Whoo! That's some great luck.\nRick: Come on, Morty. Luck had nothing to do with it. I'm great. That's the real reason. Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy? Will you hand me a screwdriver so I can finish my ionic dis defibulizer?\nMorty: Sure thing, Rick. Here's a screwdriver.\nRick: All right, Morty. Thank you very much. We got one screw turn... and two screw turns... and... all right, Morty, here we are.\nMorty: Oh, my god, Rick! Is that us?! W-w-w-we're dead! What is going on, Rick? I'm freaking out!\nRick: Calm down, Morty! Look at me! Calm down, Morty!\nMorty: No, I can't deal with this!\nRick: Calm yourself, Morty.\nMorty: I can't deal with this, Rick!\nRick: Calm down, Morty.\nMorty: This can't be real!\nRick: You got to calm down, Morty.\nMorty: W-w-w-w-we're ripped apart!\nRick: Shut up and listen to me! It's fine. Everything is fine. There's an infinite number of realities, Morty, and in a few dozen of those, I got lucky and turned everything back to normal. I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time. Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine. We're not skipping a beat, Morty. Now, help me with these bodies.\nMorty: This is insane.\nRick: Look, Morty, I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay? I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up.\nMorty: Rick, what about the reality we left behind?\nRick: What about the reality where hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is don't think about it. It's not like we can do this every week, anyways. We get three or four more of these, tops. Now, pick up your dead self and come on. Haste makes waste. I-i-i don't suppose you've considered this detail, but obviously, if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did, we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome.\n♪ look on down from the bridge ♪ ♪ there's still fountains down there ♪ ♪ look on down from the bridge ♪ ♪ it's still raining up here ♪ ♪ everybody seems so far away from me ♪ ♪ everybody just wants to be free ♪ ♪ look away from the sky ♪ ♪ it's no different when you're leaving home ♪ ♪ I can't be the same thing to you now ♪ ♪ I'm just gone ♪ ♪ just gone ♪ ♪ how could I say goodbye? ♪ ♪ how could I say goodbye? ♪\nSummer: You know, the thing about a shark... he's got lifeless eyes... black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn't seem to be living until he bites ya, and then the the blood, and the red, and the water...\nJerry: [sighs] You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?\nBeth: Sometimes. But, I'm ashamed to admit, now that they're gone, I'm finally happy.\nRick: Here we are, cronenberg Morty a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged. We'll fit right in, cronenberg Morty. It'll be like we never even left cronenberg world.\nMorty: Yeah, cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I'm gonna miss cronenberg world, because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you know? I mean, i-i wish we hadn't genetically ruined cronenberg world beyond repair like we did, you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around.\nRick: Don't you worry about that sort of thing, cronenberg Morty.

I told you, you don't have to buy me anything. You and Ryan are throwing me a birthday party and that's enough.\nSummer: Look, I know you've never had a birthday party before, let alone been to one, but usually people get presents for their birthday, so will you please tell me what you want?\nTaylor: Okay, honestly, I want Ryan to ask me to go to Berkeley with him next year.\nSummer: Okay, I was thinking more along the lines of a cute top.\nTaylor: I know, I know, it's just, I'm a planner, and I've already seeing that day six months in the future when we all go our separate ways. And I just know that if Ryan goes to Berkeley and I go to... Harvard or Princeton or Oxford, then it's over.\nSummer: Don't you have to apply to Berkeley first in order to... You already applied to Berkeley? Does Ryan know this?\nTaylor: No.I applied before we even started dating. I just got back from France and I figured, well, I had to go somewhere, so I reapplied to Princeton, Oxford,Yale, Harvard and the Sorbonne, and I figured why not throw Berkeley in?\nSummer: Um, hi. Can we get two coffees, please?\nMan: Uh, yeah.\nSummer: Okay. So you want to get Ryan to tell you that he wants you to go to Berkeley, without knowing that you already got in to Berkeley?\nTaylor: Exactly.\nSummer: And how're you going to do that?\nTaylor: Easy.I just need to get him to tell me that he loves me.\nSummer: Mm-hmm, Ryan talking about his feelings. Now that would be an earth-shattering event.\nMan: Careful, they're hot.\nSummer: Thank you.\nTaylor: Thanks.\nSummer: Did you see this about earthquake weather? You know, it's exactly this kind of voodoo science that lets politicians deny global warming.\nTaylor: Oh, my God, I know. And how many times have they predicted the big one, and it never happens. It almost makes you wish that it would. Generic Cohen's garden\nRyan: Good morning. What's the occasion?\nTaylor: Just you're being so sweet throwing me a birthday party, and I wanted to thank you, so... Oh, my gosh, did I ever tell you about...\nRyan: How you've never had a birthday party and you've always spent every birthday alone in your room watching Sixteen Candles and talking to a gypsy on the psychic hot line?\nTaylor: Yeah, I know, I'm a broken record. Just, you know, it really means a lot to me that you're doing this for me.\nRyan: Well, Taylor, I'll tell you, planning your birthday party is not easy. I expect something in return.\nTaylor: Oh.\nRyan: I expect to have my way with you.\nTaylor: Ryan!\nRyan: Well, all that time and energy. Clowns, balloons, a magician...\nTaylor: Oh, oh, well, if there's a magician. It's kind of strange to think about all of this ending isn't it?\nRyan: Hmm?\nTaylor: You, going off to Berkeley, me, whichever way the wind blows.\nRyan: Well, it's still six months away.\nTaylor: Right, yeah. If only I had a crystal ball, huh? Maybe I should call Esmerelda from the psychic hot line.\nRyan: This a really good croissant.\nTaylor: Don't you have the feeling that we're on the cusp of something and we just need to leap into the void?\nRyan: Did you get these at Joe's?\nTaylor: Ryan, don't you have that feeling?\nRyan: What?\nTaylor: That life is telling us to take a wild, impulsive jump into the unknown?\nRyan: Not really.\nTaylor: So, you're good? You don't have a need to just let something explode out of you, consequences be damned?\nRyan: What are we talking about?\nTaylor: Well, I was... I guess it's just my birthday and I'm getting sentimental.\nRyan: All right, well, don't worry. It's going to be great. Okay? All right, I've got to go. Thanks for this. Hey, tonight, you want to do something? See a movie?\nTaylor: Yeah, sure, okay.\nRyan: All right, great. At Roberts'\nKaitlin: Oh, my God.\nJulie: Oh, hi, honey. Sorry, I didn't hear you coming down.\nKaitlin: Mom, do you mind? Because I still have to eat in here.\nJulie: What can I get you?\nKaitlin: You want some scrambled eggs or I could whip up some pancakes.\nFrank: You cook, too? That's amazing.\nJulie: It's just a talent I have.\nFrank: Yeah, one of many.\nKaitlin: I'm seriously never going to stop barfing.\nJulie: Kaitlin, don't be gross.\nKaitlin: Me? Gross? What's gross is Frank's dirty... germy convict bag is sitting on the counter. I mean, what, did the warden give that to you as a going-away present?\nJulie: Kaitlin...\nFrank: It's okay. It's okay. It shouldn't be on the counter. Though I actually got it at REI.\nKaitlin: Well, why bother with a bag? You can just move in. You spend enough time here anyway.\nJulie: Young lady, apologize.\nKaitlin: I'm sorry, Frank. Feel free to have as many conjugal visits as you'd like.\nFrank: You know, I... I should get going. I've got a job interview.\nJulie: I'll walk you out.\nFrank: Okay.\nJulie: And we'll talk later. At the gym\nHolly: Mrs. Cohen? Holly. I went to Harbor with Seth.\nKirsten: Oh, hi.\nHolly: Hi, are you here for prenatal yoga?\nKirsten: Oh, yes, I am. And you?\nHolly: Yes. I just found out. How far along are you?\nKirsten: Oh, not-not very. I just found out, too.\nHolly: Well, this class is great. I told Missy, the instructor, I have worked way too hard for this body to just let it turn into some dumpy baby factory. I mean, who says I can't have a baby and a six pack?\nKirsten: I should probably stretch before class.\nHolly: Well, hold on just a second. Hey, hos, come here. This is Mrs. Cohen. She just found out she's pregnant.\nGirl: Oh, my gosh!\nOther girl: Congratulations. And you're not even showing.\nHolly: So... should we let her in?\nGirl: Oh, yeah.\nOther girl: Totally. She's ripped.\nHolly: We formed a club. Promised ourselves we wouldn't turn out like Molly the Mammoth over there.\nGirl: In nine months I'm wearing my bikini. I don't care what anyone says.\nOther girl: And I told Jerry if I get too big, I'm inducing at eight months. It's much easier to lose the weight.\nHolly: So do you want in? We call ourselves the Six-Pack Pack. Isn't that like so cute? Don't you just want to barf?\nKirsten: All the time. At Ryan's workplace\nRyan: Summer, what's up?\nSummer: Hey. I am just picking up Seth. Taking him to an art exhibition, sponsored by GEORGE, the Global Environmental Organization regarding Greenhouse Emissions.\nRyan: Seth's going to an art show.\nSummer: Well, yeah, I mean, he's going to art school, and I like the environment,so I thought it was the perfect date.\nRyan: Sure.\nSummer: So are you ready for Taylor's party?\nRyan: Oh, yeah, party's all set. Even got her a present.\nSummer: Really. Mind telling me what it is?\nRyan: Well, you know, she likes translating those French love poems? I collected a few. Had them bound for her.\nSummer: Atwood, that is so romantic. You know, nothing is as romantic as the first time you tell someone you love them,though, huh?\nRyan: I, uh... haven't told Taylor I love her.\nSummer: You haven't?\nRyan: Has she said something?\nSummer: No. No, I-I just assumed. You guys have been together for a while and you seem pretty happy. I thought,\"Why wouldn't you have said I love you?\" I have an idea. Why don't you?\nRyan: What?\nSummer: For her birthday. You should, because... the book of poems is awesome, but add that special little \"I love you. As as girl,I don't know, me personally, I got chills.\nRyan: Does Taylor expect me to tell her that I love her on her birthday?\nSummer: What? No. I don't know. I've got to go. At the shopping center\nKaitlin: I can't stay, okay?\nFrank: Well, thanks for meeting me.\nKaitlin: I wanted to talk to you alone. You're not going to do anything pervy are you?\nFrank: Kaitlin... I care about your mom. And considering my past, I understand why you're suspicious.\nKaitlin: Look, I really don't care that you went to prison, all right? I mean, the Bullet went to prison and he was awesome. You're just boring.\nFrank: I'm sorry, but it's just the way it is. Well, I have to say I don't think that's fair. You hardly know me.\nKaitlin: Then say something funny.\nFrank: What?\nKaitlin: Make me laugh.\nFrank: Fine. I don't know what interests a 15-year-old girl, but your mother doesn't think I'm boring.\nKaitlin: Well, that's because you're sleeping with her.\nFrank: Can you not say that kind of thing?\nKaitlin: Well, what do you want me to say? I mean, is it true in prison on your first day, you got to make someone your bitch? Or what about the whole dropping the soap thing? I mean, really,why don't you guys just install soap dispensers?\nFrank: Hey, I make your mom happy. I'm just asking for a chance here, Kaitlin.\nKaitlin: Of course. If it makes my mom happy. At Roberts'\nJulie: Oh, my God. Oh... my God. Art's exposition\nSummer: It's so beautiful. Just forget how the ocean ties us all together. You know, he's so right. If we aren't good custodians for our planet, what right do we have to be here? Don't you think that was amazing?\nSeth: Mm-hmm. I give it a three.\nSummer: A three? He put a radio transmitter in a piece of trash, threw it into the ocean, followed it around for six years just to show how pollution travels. And you're giving it a three?\nSeth: I'm gonna give it a three-and-a-half, then.\nSummer: What about the part where he followed it through the oil fires in the Persian Gulf, and he got third-degree burns on his arms?\nSeth: I know, but the camera work was terrible, and what kind of film stock was he using? The oranges and reds totally bled together.\nSummer: He was just making a point to show the health of our planet.\nSeth: Yeah, but he's also making a movie,and as a movie, it sucks.\nSummer: Well, what about that one? Where the turtle adopted the hippo who was lost in the tsunami?\nSeth: Mm-hmm. That's pretty much the nature film equivalent of a chick flick.\nSummer: Okay. What about that? Where the family giraffes habitat was destroyed.\nSeth: Yeah, shot like a perfume ad.\nSummer: God, what is your problem,Seth? I just want you to get excited about something.\nSeth: I am, about things that are good. But I could do one of these doughnuts with both hands tied behind my back.\nSummer: Really?Prove it.\nSeth: What?\nSummer: Make a movie.\nSeth: Are you serious?\nSummer: Yeah. I want see you do it better. I want to go watch the penguins again, and don't you dare say anything. At Sandy's office\nSandy: Hey, I didn't know you were coming by. I was just at Spitzy's office. You should have called. Is everything all right?\nKirsten: The people in Newport are awful.\nSandy: Honey, you're a little late to the party. I've been saying that for 20 years.\nKirsten: Has it gotten worse? I mean, I know Julie and some of the othersare bad, but...\nSandy: What happened?\nKirsten: I was at this prenatal yoga class and these young women they're monsters. They wanted me to join the six-pack pack.\nSandy: The what?\nKirsten: And then they talk about inducing labor at eight months so that they don't have to gain weight. Can we raise another child around this?\nSandy: Oh, honey, Newport's always had that element, and still we managed to have life. And not everybody's like that. You know what? Spitz has been wanting us to meet his wife. How about we do dinner tomorrow? Restore your faith in humanity.\nKirsten: All right.\nSandy: But more importantly, do you think they'll let me join the six-pack pack? I've been doing my sit-ups. Come on, hit me with your best shot. Go ahead, come on, wind up. I'm not a beast! At Cohen's\nTaylor: Oh, God, he really loves her. And she is never going to know how he feels, because he can't tell her. Isn't that tragic?\nRyan: Yep.\nTaylor: I mean, how could you do that? How could you just let the love of your life slip away because you were too afraid to tell them how you really felt?\nRyan: Well, maybe she's better off.\nTaylor: Uh-huh. Did you get that from the scene where she was about to be burned at the stake?\nRyan: No, she's a beautiful woman, he's a hunchback who lives in a bell tower. The chances of it working out...\nTaylor: Yeah, but he doesn't know that. If he at least told her how he felt, then maybe there would be a way to work things out. You know, they could have a life together. Or you know, at least four more years. Why did you save me?\nRyan: But the archbishop...\nTaylor: Ryan, I'm not talking about the movie. It's... There's just moments in everyone's life, and if you just let them slip away, then... then they're gone forever. And that's the tragic thing about life. Don't you feel that way?\nRyan: Taylor.I...missed the last part of the movie Would you mind rewinding it a little?\nTaylor: Sure.\nRyan: Thanks.\nTaylor: Lonely, huh? Better get used to it, buddy. At Roberts'\nSummer: Good morning.\nTaylor: If you say so.\nSummer: What's that?\nTaylor: This is the obituary for mine and Ryan's relationship. A rose, plucked before its time.\nSummer: Uh-huh, English?\nTaylor: I wrote a letter to the Dean of Berkeley, telling him that I must respectfully decline the scholarship, and he should offer it to the next candidate.\nSummer: So you're saying no? What happened with Ryan?\nTaylor: I tried, Summer, I really did. The moment was upon us. We were staring into each other's eyes,and... And he just didn't say it. You know, sometimes I just want to grab him and tie him to a chair and shoot him full of sodium pentathol and see what spills out.\nSummer: Why don't you?\nTaylor: You don't think it's too crazy? Because I was thinking if the two of us just tackled him and then we could tie him down...\nSummer: I wasn't talking literally.\nTaylor: Oh.\nSummer: Do you love him?\nTaylor: Yeah, I really do.\nSummer: Do you think he loves you?\nTaylor: Well, sometimes he grabs my handand he squeezes it for no reason. I mean, what else could that mean?\nSummer: Okay. So we just need to loosen his tongue a little.\nTaylor: But how are we going to... Summer Roberts, you bad thing.\nSummer: Okay, you know what, a trip to the Robert's wine cellar is in order. At Cohen's\nSandy: What the hell is he doing?\nRyan: Morning.\nSandy: Morning. Hey, are y all right?\nRyan: Yeah, it's just a cramp.\nSandy: How far did you go?\nRyan: Mm, nine, ten miles.\nSandy: Oh. Wouldn't it be easier if you just said,\"Sandy, there's something bothering me. Can you give me some advice?\"\nRyan: Yes, it would,but where's the fun in that?\nSandy: Let me guess. You're trying to decide if you love Taylor so you can tell her on her birthday.\nRyan: Huh?\nSandy: You've been dating for a while, things are good, birthday's tomorrow. Bingo.\nRyan: Yeah. You're good.\nSandy: So? Do you love her?\nRyan: Uh, honestly I'm scared.\nSandy: Good, you should be.\nRyan: That's reassuring.\nSandy: Well, it might be the most powerful thing you can say to another person. It changes everything. Now for heaven's sake, if you don't feel it,don't say it.\nRyan: Yeah, it's just I think she's expecting it.\nSandy: And to not say it... It's like saying you don't love her.\nRyan: Exactly.\nSandy: Well, do you care about her?\nRyan: Of course.\nSandy: Do you enjoy being with her?\nRyan: More than with anyone.\nSandy: Tell her that. It won't be exactly what she wants to hear,but it'll be honest.\nRyan: All right.\nSandy: Can you tell me something?\nRyan: Sure.\nSandy: Do you have any idea why Seth is filming the pool?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSeh: Hey, check it out, man. Summer challenged me to make this pretentious art film, so I'm making one called Six Hours In The Pool.\nRyan: Sounds great.\nSeth: Yeah, I'll tell you about it later. Uh, Taylor called. She wants you to go over there for dinner.\nRyan: Oh, okay.\nSeth: Yeah. Okay. Ah, it's perfect.\nAt Roberts'\nJulie: Look, Frank, I get that men have urges, and I imagine prison is one of those places where those urges get twisted, but...\nFrank: Julie...\nJulie: I've never even heard of clown p0rn. I mean that photo where they're all stuffed into the little car...\nFrank: It's not mine.\nJulie: Oh, really? It was just in your bag, along with... this? I mean, which one of us is supposed to wear this?\nFrank: Julie, none of this is mine.\nJulie: So someone just went into your bag, planted a wig and some really bad clown p0rn. Who would...? Oh... Kaitlin.\nFrank: Julie, it's all right.\nJulie: No, Frank, it's not. My daughter is trying to sabotage this relationship. And where would she get her hands on clown p0rn?\nFrank: She's just hazing me, you know? It'll be good for me to show her that I can take it. It'll blow over. It's not serious.\nJulie: Did you see p.50? At Cohen's\nSummer: How much more of this is there?\nSeth: Five hours and 58 minutes. What are you doing?\nSummer: I'm not going to sit here and watch six hours of the pool. I told you to become engaged in something. Instead, you just set up a tripod.\nSeth: It's a satire. It's a comment on the lack of artistic rigor...\nSummer: No, it's you being lazy. How many naps did you take while you made this?\nSeth: I took two to res... Do you feel like you're overreacting a little bit? I mean, what does it really matter?\nSummer: That's the problem, Seth. You did this because you chose the path of least resistance. You know, you could have made a movie about anything in your life, and instead you chose this.\nSeth: So what am I supposed to do? Follow Ryan around with a camera until he punches someone?\nSummer: Yes, anything that engages you in the world.\nSeth: What is the point?\nSummer: Well, if nothing else,it's important to me. Yatch club\nSandy: Thanks. Mr. Spitz.\nJason: How are you? Kirsten, how's it going?\nKirsten: Hello, Jason.\nJason: Listen, you guys, I want you to meet my wife, com.\nCarrie: No way, really? Well, then what did she say?\nJason: Honey, honey.\nCarrie: Oh, my God. What a complete ho-bag.\nJason: Honey.\nCarrie: I got to go. Call me back. Love you, bitch. Hi. I am so sorry.\nJason: Kirsten and Sandy Cohen, this is Carrie, my wife.\nCarrie: So nice to meet you.\nSandy: You, too.\nCarrie: That was my girlfriend. She's having trouble dating this guy, and the guy's wife is all like, uh, \"I'll kill you.\"\nSandy: Wow, I imagine that could be a little hard to handle.\nCarrie: Oh, whatever. Not my problem.\nKirsten: So, Carrie, you're from Newport?\nCarrie: Oh, yeah, born and bred.\nKirsten: Really. Interesting.\nCarrie: Oh, now, Sandy, let's get to it. How can we convince Jason here to get out of that soup kitchen he calls an office and get a real job? At Roberts'\nRyan: Oh, thanks, that's good.\nTaylor: For luck.\nRyan: Uh, actually, I'm not that big a wine drinker.\nTaylor: I know, you can't have coq au vin without the vin.\nRyan: Well, that's true.\nTaylor: Okay.\nRyan: You know, I feel kind of bad, you making dinner the day before your birthday.\nTaylor: No, it's my pleasure. Absolutely. Oh, sorry.\nRyan: It's okay.\nTaylor: I'm nervous 'cause I've never cooked for you before. Okay, cheers.\nRyan: Oh, yeah.\nTaylor: Whoo, bottoms up. Mmm. Tasty.\nRyan: So, uh...Oh, that's... So, Taylor, there's something I want to talk to you about.\nTaylor: No, let's save all the serious conversation for after dinner. We don't want it to get cold.\nRyan: Okay.\nTaylor: Hmm, I think I need another sip. Wow, do you detect a hint of blackberries?\nRyan: Mm, no, I don't.\nTaylor: Try it. It's fun, come on.\nRyan: Uh... Okay. Mm. Nope, no blackberries.\nTaylor: I think you need to take a bigger sip. Yatch club\nSandy: You still go to your sorority rush?\nCarroie: Sandy, sisterhood doesn't just end with graduation. A Tri-Delt once, a Tri-Delt forever. Oh, but last year,I got so sick. Totally embarrassing.\nKirsten: I can only imagine.\nCarrie: And I thought,\"Carrie, what gives?\" Can't you hold your liquor anymore? Ugh! And then I realized it was just morning sickness. Was that a relief.\nSandy: You know, I'm afraid it's getting a little late for us.\nCarrie: Oh, no, no,no, no. You are not running away. This great bar just opened up on Ocean. When was the last time you two did tequila poppers?\nSandy: Maybe another time.\nCarrie: Oh, tell me you're not bailing because you're pregnant. I mean, no offense, but that is lame.\nJason: Carrie, no.\nCarrie: What?It's lame.\nKirsten: Actually, I'm an alcoholic.\nCarrie: Oh, God. Me, too. Hey, after you have that thing, we should totally go out. You know, without the two dish rags. Oh, God! Can you just take that thing outside? Oh, don't freak. I'm not a psycho.It's our baby.\nJason: When we go out with the baby, Carrie likes to have the nurse sit nearby,a few tables away.\nKirsten: Oh, you know,Sandy, I'm-I'm, uh, suddenly... I'm, I'm not feeling well.\nSandy: I'd better get you home. Thank you both for an unforgettable evening. Jason, I'll talk to you Monday.\nJason: Yeah. Well,good night,and...\nCarrie: Hey, Kirsten,uh, remember,you can call me for baby advice anytime.\nKirsten: Sure.\nCarrie: Losers.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAt Roberts'\nTaylor: I don't understand how you're not drunk.\nRyan: Oh, it's the Atwood genes. We're built to withstand massive quantities of alcohol.\nTaylor: Ooh. Here we go. Here's the bed. Okay, all right. Now we're just gonna... Whoa. That's good.\nTaylor: But if I can't get you drunk, you'll never tell me you love me.\nRyan: Oh, Taylor.\nTaylor: I know, I know. Bad Taylor. I shouldn't have tried to get you drunk. Just like I shouldn't have pretended to be your sleep therapist, or rented Roger the homosexual, or stalked you wearing a Groundhog costume, or... What else did I do?\nRyan: I-I think that's it.\nTaylor: I'm going to go to sleep now. Oh. Good-bye, Ryan. It was nice.\nRyan: Taylor. Taylor? Are you pretending to go to sleep, thinking I'll tell you I love you while you're unconscious?\nTaylor: Maybe. Don't laugh at me.\nRyan: I'm not.\nTaylor: It's hard dating someone who doesn't tell you how they feel and always having to interpret hand squeezes and...\nRyan: I love you.\nTaylor: What?\nRyan: I love you.\nTaylor: You do?\nRyan: Uh, yeah.\nTaylor: I can't believe you just said it.\nRyan: Neither can I.\nTaylor: Oh, I love you, too.\nRyan: Oh, good.\nTaylor: Yay!Yay! Now we can go to Berkeley together.\nRyan: What?\nTaylor: Yeah.Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got into Berkeley. I applied, and I got this letter, and put it on my desk and... At Cohen's\nSeth: Ryan Atwood. His face betrays no emotion, but what passions lurk behind those eyes? Answering that is the purpose of this film. Come with me, my friends.\nRyan: I thought the movie was about the pool.\nSeth: Summer didn't really take to six hours of the pool. She wanted me to make a movie in which I engage with people. What is Ryan Atwood wrapping so intently? Taylor's birthday present. Ah, Taylor Townsend, the fast-talking Eve Harrington who melted Ryan Atwood's heart. Tell us, Ryan,how does it feel to have Dean Hess's sloppy seconds? Or what did you get her? Either one.\nRyan: Um... well, uh, one of her hobbies is translating French love poems, so I had them bound for her.\nSeth: Wow. That is really romantic.\nRyan: Well, it's, it's not that romantic.\nSeth: Are you kidding? You may as well tell her you love her.\nRyan: It's, uh, it's actually a little late for that.\nSeth: What?\nRyan: Yeah. At Roberts'\nSummer: And then what happened?\nTaylor: Well, we finished dinner and he still wasn't drunk, so I suggested a drinking game. I called it \"Drink.\" Whenever I said \"drink,\" we drank.\nSummer: Simple but effective.\nTaylor: Yeah, a little too effective. I ended up on the coffee table singing \"Part of Your World\" and telling him he was my Prince Eric.\nSummer: Uh, did he say it?\nTaylor: Yes.\nSummer: He did?!\nTaylor: Yeah!\nSummer: Oh, my God, that's amazing. Ow. Ryan told you he loved you.\nTaylor: I know. I mean, I think he said it. At Cohen's\nRyan: Yeah, this feeling just kind of came over me and... I couldn't stop myself.\nSeth: So why the long face? You regretting it?\nRyan: Well... it turns out she applied to Berkeley without telling me, and now...\nSeth: Your spur-of-the-moment \"I love you\" issuddenly committing you to four more years. The plot thickens.\nRyan: I'm not saying it'd be bad. It just seems like all of a sudden we're going mach five.\nSeth: You'd like to turn down the heat a little. At Roberts'\nTaylor: He definitely said it.\nSummer: Absolutely.\nTaylor: I think.\nSummer: Well, don't you think you'd remember?\nTaylor: I don't know; it hurts. Summer, what am I going to do? I can't just ask him, by the way, did you tell me you loved me last night? Because I was too plastered to remember.\nSummer: Right. Okay. Today's your birthday right? And I happen to know that he got you a crazy, romantic present. So when you open it tonight, why don't you just be like \"Oh, my gosh, Ryan, I love you,\" and if he said it last night, he'll say it again.\nTaylor: You're a genius.\nSummer: Yes, I am; it's all up here. It's just there might be one other tiny little thing. At Cohen's\nSeth: I'm not saying take it back, but today's her birthday, right? So she's going to be interpreting every little thing. So maybe you send her a message. For instance, that sends the message \"You're the only girl in the world for me. Let's move to a co-op in Berkeley.\" Is that what you want to say? We go off Ryan Atwood. What will he do? How will this situation resolve itself? At Roberts'\nSummer: You said something about Berkeley?\nTaylor: I'm not sure. Maybe I was just talking about him going to Berkeley. That would make sense, right?\nJulie: Morning, girls. Happy birthday, Taylor.\nTaylor: Thanks, Julie.\nJulie: Oh, I gave the mailman that letter from the counter.\nTaylor: What letter? The letter to Berkeley?\nJulie: Yeah, I think so.\nTaylor: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTaylor: Uh-uh! Mister! Mail carrier, sir. Excuse me, please. Um, could you wait? Hi. I'm sorry. Um, a woman in that house where I live just gave you a letter that she shouldn't have,and, uh, I kind of need it back.\nMan: Ma'am, once the letter goes in the pouch, it's the property of the Federal government.\nTaylor: Okay, and I totally understand that, but if you take that letter, I am going to lose my place at Berkeley and the chance to be with the man I love and who I think loves me, and, and 15 years from now, when he is trapped in a loveless marriage and I have become a cold, hard ice queen for whom love is no more than a distant memory, it will come down to the fact that on this morning, which coincidentally happens to be my birthday, you obeyed the letter of the law at the expense of simple, human charity.\nMan: Wow, that was amazing.\nTaylor: Can I have my letter now?\nMan: Yeah, sure.\nAt Cohen's\nFrank: Hey.\nRyan: I didn't know you were a runner.\nFrank: Yeah,it helps me to work stuff out You should try it.\nRyan: Maybe I will. Everything okay?\nFrank: Yeah. No, I was just,uh, nearby. I figured I'd stop in and say hello, ask your advice on winning over a 15-year-old Newport girl.\nRyan: Kaitlin giving you trouble?\nFrank: Well, things with Julie are great, and I-I'm so grateful to you and Taylor,but Caitlin, she just... I don't know,she just seems to want to shut me out. And I know that you have some experience with the Cooper women, so...\nRyan: Well, a Porsche would probably do the trick.\nFrank: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's not really in my budget.\nRyan: Well, Kaitlin's had a tough year. You know. Once she sees that her mom's happy, she'll come around. Just be patient.\nFrank: Ah... suddenly a Porsche sounds like a bargain.\nRyan: Right. Uh, look,I, I got to get going, help set up Taylor's party.\nFrank: Oh, sure. Is that, is that her present?\nRyan: Oh, yeah, it's, uh... she translated these French love poems so I had them bound in leatherfor her.\nFrank: Oh, my son the romantic.\nRyan: Yeah.\nFrank: So I'll, uh, see you tonight.\nRyan: Yeah. It's not that romantic. At the shopping center\nSummer: Taylor, it's going to be fine. Ryan's going to give you a really romantic present, tell you he loves you, and you guys are going to wind up going to Berkeley together. Don't worry.\nTaylor: Okay, yeah, I know. Do you think I should act surprised when I go to the party?\nSummer: But it's not a surprise party.\nTaylor: Well, I know, but it might make Ryan feel good.\nSummer: Okay, it's a great idea.\nTaylor: Ah!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEveryone: Happy birthday! Happy birthday.Happy birthday.\nTaylor: Oh, my God, what a surprise.\nSandy: Oh, I didn't know it was a surprise party.\nSummer: Just go with it, okay? It's Taylor.\nRyan: Happy birthday.\nTaylor: This is a-amazing.\nRyan: Yeah, well, you deserve it. You got a lot of birthdays to catch up on.\nTaylor: Is everything okay?\nRyan: Yeah, absolutely. Let me get you a drink.\nTaylor: Okay.\nJulie: Happy birthday.\nTaylor: Thank you.\nKaitlin: Happy birthday.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSandy: We can move. I mean it. Ryan and Seth will be gone in six months. We could put the house on the market, throw a dart at the map. Maybe it's time.\nKirsten: But this is our home.\nSandy: So? We'll make some place new our home. You know? We'll still have our memories.\nKirsten: But when Ryan and Seth come home for the holidays, I want them to come home to that house.\nSandy: It was an idea.\nKirsten: Well, thanks, Sandy. I just don't think I can.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTaylor: Oh, my God. It's a replica of the green destiny sword from Crouching Tiger. Oh, my God, thank you so much Seth.\nSeth: Glad you like it.\nTaylor: It's so neat.\nSummer: Open Ryan's present.\nTaylor: Okay. Where is it?\nRyan: Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.\nKirsten: Ryan's embarrassed.\nRyan: No, it's just, it's um, personal.\nSandy: Well, I hope so.\nTaylor: Oh, my God. It's a... It's a dictionary?\nKirsten: That is practical.\nRyan: Yeah, the guy said that it, um, had more words than others.\nSandy: Well, that's good, being as it is a dictionary.\nSeth: It's red-- that's a cool color.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSummer: I still love him, you know? I'm sorry, I shouldn't be telling you this.\nKirsten: No, I understand. I worry about him a lot.\nSummer: You know, I know making this movie just seems so stupid, but I just wanted him to get excited about something, you know? Anything.\nKirsten: Just give him a chance. Seth will find his way.\nSummer: I hope so. He just seems a little lost.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKaitlin: Those are mine.\nJulie: What do you think you're doing?\nKaitlin: What? The guy likes clown p0rn. I think everyone should know.\nJulie: Do you have any idea how humiliated Frank would be if he saw, or if Ryan saw it? It's his father, Kaitlin.\nKaitlin: Whatever.\nJulie: Do not walk away from me. I've tried to be understanding. I'm sorry if Frank isn't as hilarious as Bullit was.\nKaitlin: It's not even about that.\nJulie: Then what is it? Is it the money?\nKaitlin: Mom, look at us. In the past year we've lost Dad, we've lost Marissa, we had Dr. Roberts and we lost him. And then we got the Bullit, lost him. What makes you think that this guy is going to stick around any longer?\nJulie: Kaitlin, am I crazy, or did you say that it was okay for me to date Frank?\nKaitlin: Yes, to date him. But it's been a week and he's practically living in our house. Like he's family. He is not family You and I are. I mean, why can't we just act like that for a little while?\nFrank: Hey. They're about to bring out the cake. Everything okay?\nJulie: Yes, everything's fine. Kaitlin, why don't you go back inside.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRyan: Taylor. Taylor, I'm sorry.\nTaylor: I'm not crazy, right? Last night, you did tell me you loved me.\nRyan: Yeah, I did.\nTaylor: Okay, then what? Are you trying to send me a message? Do you wish you hadn't said it?\nRyan: No. Last night when I told you... You mentioned going to Berkeley.\nTaylor: God, I knew it. Ryan, yes, I applied to Berkeley months ago. Before you and I ever started dating.\nRyan: Oh.\nTaylor: And then, this, you and I happened, and I thought, I don't know, maybe. And I guess I should have told you, but I really needed to know exactly how you felt first.\nRyan: I just think our planning to go to college together, it's a big decision.\nTaylor: Would you have said you loved me if you'd known I'd gotten in to Berkeley? Great. Wow, okay. I'm just going to go.\nRyan: Taylor.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSummer: She's coming. Come on. This is where you blow out the candles and make a wish.\nTaylor: I'm sorry.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSandy: Don't worry. Kirsten and I will square up things here.\nRyan: All right, great. Thanks. And I gave Seth the car to help carry the presents.\nSandy: So where you going now?\nRyan: Uh, I don't know. I'll see you later.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRyan: Hey. You okay?\nKaitlin: Yeah. Sure. But by the looks of it, you and I aren't going to be brother and sister any time soon.\nRyan: Oh, no. What happened?\nKaitlin: Honestly? It was me. I mean, look, Ryan, I have absolutely nothing against your dad. It's just I really didn't want to rush into an insta-family again. I mean, how long would this one last? Like a month?\nRyan: Well, you never know. I, uh, moved in with the Cohens and I gave it a week. Here I am.\nKaitlin: I just wish there was a way you could tell if it was all going to work out.\nRyan: Yeah, but there isn't. But I promise you, I will always be your brother, in a completely, non-creepy way.\nJulie: Kaitlin, honey, could I talk to you?\nKaitlin: Yeah. Wait, Ryan, as your sister, if you don't tell Taylor that you love her, you're an idiot.\nRyan: Oh.\nJulie: She's right.\nAt Cohen's\nSummer: Oh, no. Seth, I'm so sorry you had to overhear that.\nSeth: No, it's all right. I mean it's true.\nSummer: What I was going to say is, I think what you made is really good.\nSeth: Yeah, there's no coherent theme. Most of the shots are too wide and the Dogma thing has been done to death. But you know, I get that you wanted me to find something that I'm passionate about, the way you're passionate about the environment.\nSummer: But you love movies.\nSeth: I do. I love going to them and then telling people what's wrong with them.\nSummer: What is it?\nSeth: I could be a critic.\nSummer: You mean spending your whole life watching movies and telling people how terrible they are?\nSeth: Yeah, that sounds awesome.\nSummer: I just want you to find something that you really care about.\nSeth: You want to go rent An Inconvenient Truth?\nSummer: Yes, I love that movie.\nSeth: I just want to count the number of gratuitously soulful shots of Al Gore staring out an airplane window.\nSummer: Do not insult Al Gore. Jettey\nKaitlin: So what did you tell Frank?\nJulie: I told him we needed to slow it down.\nKaitlin: Mom, if you really like him...\nJulie: I do. And he's not going away. But I told him that right now I need to be spending some time with my daughter.\nKaitlin: Does that include buying me ice cream?\nJulie: Absolutely. At Roberts'\nTaylor: The hermit? My soul card's the hermit? Are you kidding me? Okay, Esmerelda, I'd better go. I guess I'll call you next year. Come in.\nRyan: Hey, I hope I'm not interrupting.\nTaylor: No.\nRyan: I got you something.\nTaylor: Okay... Wait, these are all poems that I've translated.\nRyan: I collected them, recopied them, had them bound.\nTaylor: Ryan, this is amazing. Are you sure this is from you?\nRyan: Taylor, I'm sorry. I freaked out. What I said last night, I meant.\nTaylor: Really?\nRyan: I love you. And I don't want to lose you. So let's put it all on the table. Berkeley, Paris, Oxford, anything.\nTaylor: I don't know what to say.\nRyan: That's a first. Jettey\nKaitlin: Oh, my God, Mom.\nJulie: It's okay, it's just... It's an earthquake. Get in here.\nKaitlin: Mom! Julie and Kaitlin take refuge in the ice-cream's store while Ryan and Taylor are at Roberts'. Seth and Summer are in the car while Sandy comes to the aid of Kirsten who felt at the mall. The earthquake is a rare intensity.

Whose bright idea was that?\nJenny: Mine.\nMcGee's computer beeps .\nMcGee: We're in.\nJenny: Bring it up.\nImages of the movement appear on the big plasma.\nMcGee: Got it. Overlaying the cell-phone signal.\nZiva: Tony's car.\nMcGee: Tony DiNardo's car.\nGibbs: How deep is his cover?\nJenny: Deep enough to withstand the sort of scrutiny la Grenouille can bring to bear.\nGibbs: You better hope so.\nMcGee: West on M Street.\nJenny: No one else is in the car with him.\nShe tries to call him.\nMcGee: He's turning north onto 29th Street.\nZiva: trafic speed. No sign of dureless.\nJenny: His cell phone is still of.\nZiva: No one seems to be tailling him.\nGibbs: Maybe he's the one doing the tailling.\nMcGee: Still on 29th.\nTony's car exploses. The whole team was surprised.\nJenny: Oh my God!\nBlack and white snapshot: Gibbs\nThe staff and the director arrived at the place where Tony's car has explosed. Firefighters deviate to let the team work. We see a charred body bent over the wheel of the car.\nGibbs: McGee.\nMcGee looks at the car and can not be detached.\nGibbs: McGee!\nMcGee out of its torpor and takes pictures of the particular weapon and the phone while Jenny looks at Tony's body and found an object.\nJenny (to McGee): Hey, that some of timer device?\nMcGee leans over and takes the object photographed.\nMcGee: Ten bucks in most electrical stores. Probably activated when the ignition turned on.\nZiva took the car photo.\nMcGee: ... Count down however long you need it to. When it reached zero...\nJenny gets up and walks to Ducky who examined the body, Gibbs by his side.\nDucky: Shock wave would have killed him before the fire. Death would have been instantaneous. Small mercies, my dear boy.\nJenny: Identification?\nDucky: The general build, height, weight are about right. Most of the epidermis and dermis on the hands and fingers have been burned off, so no fingerprints. We need to get his dental records for positive identification. And there is any chance that it's not Tony?\nJenny: None that I can think of.\nShe walks away.\nDucky (to Gibbs): She blames herself.\nGibbs nodded.\nDucky: Should she?\nGibbs: Let me know when you finish, Duck.\nHe goes in turn. Ziva on his side the badge photograph of Tony. McGee is with her.\nMcGee: You believe in miracles, Ziva?\nZiva: Not part of my training.\nMcGee: That might be not Tony.\nThey both look the car silently.\nAbby's lab.\nIt removes the evidence found at the scene of the accident. Gibbs is also there.\nAbby: Tony is not dead Gibbs. Not until Ducky says it's him. Until then, he's just... he's not here. And I don't care what the evidence says. Even if everything here belongs to Tony, it's still not him until Ducky says that it's him. And don't try to tell me anything different, because I'm not gonna believe you.\nShe freezes.\nAbby: Tell me it's not him Gibbs. Tell me it's not him.\nShe takes Gibbs in his arms.\nGibbs: I wish I could Abby.\nShe departs from him and goes to his computer.\nAbby: I need to be alone right now with the gang. I've got work to do.\nGibbs sees the bottle of scotch and glass that gave Jenny the analysis. He takes gloves.\nGibbs: Abby, how did these get here?\nAbby: Director Shepard swore me to secrecy when she brought those in and asked me to run them for the prints, so I can't tell you.\nHe took off the gloves and approached her.\nGibbs: Any other secrets you can't tell me?\nAbby: No. It's just that one. Because when director Shepard said that there wasn't an AFIS match, and then tries to hide the results from me, she actually didn't swear me to secrecy, so that is not a secret.\nGibbs: Who was the match?\nAbby: Her father.\nGibbs: Her father has been dead for 12 years, Abby.\nAbby: No, not according to AFIS.\nShe taps on his keyboard and displays the results.\nAbby: That is a ten-point match, Gibbs. These are new prints. There's no way Director Shepard's father is dead.\nDirector's Shepard office\nJenny looks out the window. Gibbs is in his office.\nJenny: I burried my father Jethro. I know he's not comming back. But someone is going to great lenghts trying to convince me he's alive.\nShe turns and faces Gibbs.\nGibbs: We've got a polygraph test Monday.\nJenny: Routine.\nGibbs: They're targeting someone.\nJenny: Me?\nGibbs: So I've been told.\nJenny: I've never failed a polygraph. I'm not abour to start.\nGibbs: And if they asked you about your father?\nJenny: He's dead.\nGibbs: Any doubt, any hesitation will raise a red flag.\nJenny: There is no doubt.\nGibbs: I saw his fingerprints.\nJenny: My father's dead.\nGibbs: Subject displayed emotional instability suggesting delusional belief her father isn't dead. Next question. We just put her on medical leave or we fire her?\nJenny defies Gibbs.\nGibbs: Opération Lodestone, you know it?\nJenny: Should I?\nGibbs: Black op, focused on weapons control and arms proliferation.\nJenny: Not one of ours.\nGibbs: CIA.\nJenny: My father's job at the Pentagon was in a field of arms control. He was under investigation for accepting a bribe when he was killed.\nGibbs: Coroner says he took his own life.\nJenny: He was murdered.\nGibbs: Proof?\nJenny: None, but I know who's responsible.\nGibbs: The same guy you sent one of my agents after?\nJenny: One of my agents. A deep undercover operation that I ran on a need-to-know basis.\nGibbs sighed and headed toward the exit.\nJenny: And Jethro if you think I'm obsessed with la Grenouille because of what's happened to my father, you're wrong.\nGibbs: You may wanna skip this polygraph test Monday.\nGibbs leaves.\nMcGee looks again the images of the explosion of the car. Ziva is at her desk.\nZiva: Must you keep doing that?\nMcGee: Just checking something Gibbs said. Tony wouldn't have carried it with him, you know. His shield and ID, not if he was undercover. And he would have stashed it in the car, maybe under the seat. Just because we found his ID doesn't mean it's Tony.\nZiva: His car, his ID, his weapon, both of his cell phones, McGee?\nMcGee sits on the edge of the office of Gibbs and rewinds the video. Ziva gets up and comes near him.\nZiva: What was is that Gibbs said that you thought needed checking?\nMcGee: He thought Tony might be talling someone.\nThey will view the video.\nZiva (outstretched hand to the screen): Stop it there. Take it back.\nMcGee rewinds. A limousine is displayed.\nZiva: It's a limousine. It was on the previous camera. It's on every camera.\nMcGee: He was following that limousine.\nHe goes to his computer.\nZiva: Where is Gibbs?\nDucky's autopsy room\nDucky is currently disequations lung. Palmer is at his side, winning in a small jar that is Ducky.\nDucky: Another shrapnel, lower left lobe.\nHe puts it in the little jar. A bell rang.\nPalmer: Blood test are back.\nHe take the paper.\nDucky: What type?\nPalmer: A+\nDucky: And Tony's?\nPalmer looks into the computer.\nPalmer: A+\nDucky sighed.\nDucky: Yes, well, 34 percent of the nation's population share the same blood group, let's not go drawing any conclusions. Well, await the dental records before making a positive ID. in the meantime,....\nIt begins to dictate his report, Palmer is taking notes.\nDucky: ...the lungs: penetratives shrapnel damage, middle and lower left lobes. Otherwise, heathly tissue. Non-smoker, minimal scarring.\nPalmer (writing): Minimal scarring.\nDucky: Minimal scarring.\nPalmer: I got that doctor.\nDucky: Yes but Mr Palmer, how could he?\nPalmer: How could he what, sir?\nDucky: Have minimal scarring in both lung.\nHe takes a knife and cut the lung.\nPalmer: Healthy living?\nDucky: Yersinia pestis, y pestis.\nPalmer: The pneumonic plague?\nDucky: Yes, the plague Mr Palmer. This man has never had the plague.\nThey smile. Ducky starts from.\nDucky: He's never had the plague.\nPalmer: No, he has never had the plague.\nDucky: He never had this damn plague.\nHe took off his gloves and threw them in Palmer. Palmer laughed.\nZiva, McGee and the director are before the plama. Gibbs stands a little further.\nZiva: The limousine is leased to a shell company. The parent company is EuroFreight.\nMcGee: Head office is in Luxembourg.\nZiva: The principal behind the company is Rene Benoit.\nMcGee: Tony could been followed la Grenouille.\nDucky arrives and goes to Gibbs.\nDucky: I'm sorry to differ Timothy but he wasn't. (To Gibbs) Look, Tony contracted pneumonic plague, I'm sure everyone can remember.\nZiva: Before my time.\nMcGee: He almost died.\nDucky (to Ziva): From severe pneumonia. (To everyone) As a result, his lung would have been extensively scarred. Unlike the almost pristine lung of the man currently in autopsy. The body on which I am performing an autopsy is not Tony's.\nAll smiles.\nJenny: If it's not Tony, then who is it?\nGibbs: And where is DiNozzo?\nBlack-and-white snapshot of Jenny\nJenny is in front of the plasma, McGee and Ziva to their office. Gibbs looks over the shoulder of McGee.\nJenny: I wanna know everything about this company. Bank statements, telephone records, personnel.\nMcGee: Hard drive's spinning up now.\nJenny: Everything Tim. If la Grenouille is in D.C, this could lead us to him.\nGibbs: Or DiNozzo.\nJenny: Well, obviously DiNozzo is our first priority.\nGibbs: Ziva, start with the hospital. Find out when DiNozzo left and with whom.\nZiva: And who was driving his car. Got it.\nTrent Kort arrives.\nKort: Director Shepard.\nJenny: Mr Kort. An unannounced visit by the CIA usually means someone's in trouble. I trust it isn't you.\nKort watching everyone.\nKort: Where is he?\nJenny: It depend on who \"he\" is.\nKort: DiNozzo.\nMcGee rises.\nJenny: I honestly don't know. And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you until you explain to me why you're looking for me so urgently.\nKort: Le Grenouille flew to D.C this morning. He didn't arrive at his safe house...\nGibbs rises of his office.\nKort: ... and his satellite phone has stopped transmitting.\nGibbs: Mislaid your arms dealer? That's gonna be embarrassing.\nKort: I don't know what NCIS is up to, but I want a private briefing in your office now.\nJenny: I'll decide what briefing you get and where you get it, Mr Kort, and if we have a problem with that, why don't you have your director give me call.\nKort: You are jeopardising one of the most important long-terme covert operations the agency has ever conducted.\nGibbs: Operation Lodestone.\nKort: You're not read in on Lodestone.\nGibbs: Ok, so read us in.\nJenny: Unless the CIA just believes in one-way trafic.\nKort: This is not going to end well for you.\nHe heads toward the elevator followed by everyone.\nGibbs: Special agent DiNozzo's car was bombed this morning but I guess you know that.\nKort: He wasn't in it.\nJenny: Thanks for sharing.\nKort: The agency has nothing to do with it.\nGibbs: Is that when you mislaid your frog, in all that confusion?\nThe elevator doors opened on Tony who laught when he see Kort.\nTony: Hey, my car blew up this morning. Did you do that?\nKort took him by the collar and the plate against the wall.\nKort: Where did you go with la Grenouille?\nTony turns his head and it means the team all weapons out and pointed at Kort. He lets Tony.\nTony: Actually he prefers René. Arms dealers get very touchy about their code names...\nThe team lowers his arms.\nTony: ... \"The Frog\" has a kind of slimy overtone to it. Maybe you should keep that in mind for next time. You could use it yourself.\nKort: We will find him, DiNozzo.\nTony: You may wanna take the stairs. I had a little upset tummy this morning.\nKort enters the elevator.\nTony: Happy frog-hunting. (To the team). What, no balloons?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn director's office\nTony, Jenny and Gibbs watches the video of the explosion of the car.\nTony: That was more exciting live.\nThey all sit around a table. Tony in front of Gibbs.\nJenny: You saw it? You were there?\nTony: Saw it, heard it, felt it.\nJenny: You can start whenever you're ready.\nTony: He was waiting when I left the hospital this morning with Jeanne. She'd arranged it. It was her little surprised, I guess. Meet the parents: Part 2. I hat sequels...\nGibbs smiles.\nTony: ... Figured my cover was blown as soon as saw him. Turned out he'd know for months.\nGibbs: Kort?\nTony: Probably. I tried talking my way out if it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTony gets into his car in the garage of the hospital.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTony: Made it as far as my car.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRené Benoit: Tony!\nTony: Crap!\nRené Benoit: These's no need to take your car. Henri will drive it. You come with Jeanne and me.\nTony: Oh, that's really nice of you. I gotta go, I really ... I need to go home and change...\nRené Benoit: I will have to insist, agent DiNozzo.\nTony gets out of the car.\nTony (to Henri): Be careful with the second. It tends a stick a little.\nHenry: Your cell-phone?\nTony gives it to him.\nRené Benoit: Both of them.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJenny: Did la Grenouille tell Jeanne who you were?\nTony: They didn't miss a beat. Pretended everything was fine. That didn't last long. I could see this guy driving my car a few car lenght behind us when...boum.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBack in the limo. Behind her, Tony's car explodes.\nRené Benoit (to Jeanne): Stay down. (To the driver) Allez!!!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTony uses a drink of water.\nJenny: What was la Grenouille's first reaction?\nTony: That he was the target.\nHe drinks, sighs.\nTony: I'm not so sure.\nGibbs: You think it was you, Tony?\nTony: It was my car, boss. And we have certainely pissed off the agency a lot lately. Well, the director and I have pissed off the agency a lot lately. Although, mainly me.\nGibbs: For what it's worth, Kort denied the agency involvement.\nTony: That's because Kort doesn't play by agency rules. The guy's got a hair trigger.\nJenny: Where did la Grenouille take you?\nTony: Well, kind of blew away the breakfast plans. Blew away a lot of things.\nJenny: Jeanne.\nTony: It wasn't supposed to happen like this.\nJenny: You never really thought it could end any other way, did you?\nTony: You mean, other than badly?\nJenny: You're not supposed to fall in love with him.\nTony: Thank you so much for that, director. I am gonna keep that in mind for next time. Wait a second, there's not gonna be a next time.\nJenny: What did Jeanne say?\nTony: Nothing I'm gonna tell you.\nJenny: Agent DiNozzo!\nTony: Nothing you need to know, director.\nFurious sight from Jenny but proud from Gibbs.\nJenny: Where is la Grenouille?\nTony: I don't know. He dropped me off at the main gate. Drove west. Probably heading to California. He was driving pretty fast. He could even be there now. Talk about his future.\nGibbs: Yeah? About what?\nTony: Doesn't think he has one.\nJenny: Probably doesn't.\nTony: He wants out.\nGibbs: Kort knows.\nTony: That would explain why he's so desperate to find him. The CIA is about to lose one of its most prized assets.\nJenny: What exactly does he mean by \"out\"?\nTony: Well, he's gonna call and arrange a meeting. And give himself up. Because he says NCIS is the only agency he trusts.\nZiva is on the phone.\nZiva: What time? Did she say how long she would be gone?\nMcGee arrives and gives him coffee. He sits on the edge of the desk.\nZiva: No, no, I understand. Thank you.\nTony McGee arrives and slaps on the back of the head, then will move to his office.\nMcGee: What was that for?\nTony: Believing I was dead.\nMcGee: Hey, I never believe that you were dead. Ziva was the one that gave up on you.\nShe gives him a punch on the arm.\nZiva (to Tony): Don't even think about the head slap. Is everything cool with the director and Gibbs?\nTony takes his phone.\nTony (to Ziva): Beyond cool. Almost icy.\nZiva: You seem anxious.\nTony: I'm fine. Anyone call for me?\nMcGee: No.\nZiva: If you're calling the hospital, she's not there. She called the ER to let them know she was going away for a few days.\nTony hangs up the phone violently.\nTony: Going where?\nZiva: She did not tell them.\nTony: Well...\nZiva: She knows?\nTony: She knows.\nZiva: What are you going to do?\nTony: I am gonna wait until the morning and then talk to her.\nAbby comes screaming and runs into the arms of Tony.\nAbby: Tony! I knew you were all right. I knew it. Everybody else give up for dead, even Ziva.\nZiva (a paper cup in the hands): Ok, so I may have acted a little hastily.\nTony: That's my letter opener.\nZiva: Excellent balance and weight. The edge is a little dull but I have always admired it.\nTony opens his drawer.\nTony: Where is my American Pie coffee mug?\nAbby: Palmer.\nTony: Mighty Mouse stapler?\nAbby: Ducky.\nBehind Tony, Ducky tries to discreetly put the staples.\nAbby: Hey Ducky.\nTony turns.\nDucky: My dear fellow I never believed it for a moment. Welcome home.\nHe gives the staples to Tony and left. Gibbs arrives.\nGibbs: It's not every day people think you are dead DiNozzo.\nAbby (running to Gibbs): Gibbs, I know who blew up Tony's car. Well not Tony's car, but his alias's car. And not exactly who but more like how and why.\nMcGee: Do you have a motive?\nAbby: Me? No. But they do.\nAbby's lab\nAbby explains his theory to the whole team.\nAbby: Every bomb-maker has a signature: the components, the way it's assembled. Sometimes right down the colored tape they use to bind it all together. In this case, the components are common to at least 9 others bombs that have gone off in the last 4 years.\nShe goes to his computer and showed pictures of explosions.\nAbby: I made a match on Interpol. The bombs have gone off all over the world: Algeria, Indonesia, the Middle-East, Chechnya...\nZiva: Anything linking the victims?\nAbby: They were all arms dealers.\nMcGee: The only problem is Tony's not an arms dealer.\nGibbs: Girlfriend's father is an arms dealer.\nTony: She's been working nights. I pick up her every morning for breakfast.\nZiva: You park the car, they strap on the bomb set the timer and walk away.\nGibbs: You weren't the target, she was.\nTony: Maybe she still is.\nGibbs: Take Ziva.\nTony et Ziva leaves.\nGibbs (to Abby): Good.\nDirector Shepard's house\nJenny opens the door of his house, her cell phone rings.\nJenny: Hello?.\nRené Benoit: Good evening Madam Director.\nJenny: Good evening. I've been told you wanna meet me.\nRené Benoit: Long overdue. I'm sure.\nShe turns the lights on and closes the doors.\nJenny: Just tell me where and when.\nRené Benoit: Now. In you study.\nLa Grenouille is in front of her in her office.\nRené Benoit: Hello, Jenny.\nBlack-and-white snapshot of a boat. Jeanne's apartment\nTony and Ziva arrives at the apartment of Jeanne. They enter.\nTony: Jeanne?\nThe cupboards are empty.\nJenny's house\nJenny and la Grenouille are in the office thereof. She stays away from him.\nRené Benoit: So here we are at last. Face to face.\nJenny: Not quite the way I expected to meet.\nRené Benoit: Nor I. I must compliment you for your pursuit.\nThey settled in a chair, Jenny is behind his desk.\nRené Benoit: I actually like your agent DiNizzo.\nJenny: So does your daughter.\nRené Benoit: Very much, yes.\nJenny: What do you want from us?\nRené Benoit: Well, a sanctuary, assylum. Call it what you will. In return of my extensive knewledge of the arms market, I want protection for my daughter.\nJenny: Protection from whom?\nGibbs enters.\nGibbs: Whoever tried to kill his daughter this morning.\nRené Benoit rises.\nRené Benoit: Agent Gibbs, I believe. Well, it's true. My ennemis come for my daughter. They wanna see me suffer. But she's safe. For the time being.\nGibbs: Which ennemis?\nRené Benoit: I have many.\nJenny: Why now?\nGibbs: This have something to do with Operation Lodestone?\nRené Benoit: He's well informed.\nJenny: Read us in.\nRené Benoit: On what? The arrogance to the CIA to do what? Make me the biggest arms dealer in the world?\nGibbs: You control the illegal arms trade, the CIA controls you.\nRené Benoit: That was the idea. Until you came along and someone found out. Another arms dealer perhaps. And I'm running out of time. I can no longer trust Kort.\nGibbs: Did you ever?\nJenny rise.\nJenny: This isn't the first time you were in this study.\nRené Benoit: No. I met your father here on occasion. Many years ago.\nJenny: Tell me about us.\nRené Benoit: He was a fine man. He had a couscience. One day, it got the better of him.\nJenny: You believe the story that my father took a bribe while overseeing an arms-reduction treaty?\nRené Benoit: Well, sadly, that's not a story. It's a fact.\nJenny: How do you know?\nRené Benoit: Because I paid him that bribe.\nShe pulls out a gun from his drawer and points to la Grenouille.\nJenny: No. You killed him because he wouldn't take it.\nRené Benoit: Well, I can understand how hard that is to accept. My daughter is... she's facing the same struggle.\nJenny round the office and is placed in front of the trafficker.\nGibbs (to Jenny): It's not loaded. I guess he beat you to it.\nRené Benoit: I didn't want you to do anything rash before I had a chance to explain myself. I need your protection.\nJenny: You have the bullets. Take the damn gun. Protect yourself.\nShe puts the gun in his hands.\nRené Benoit: You're sign my death warrant.\nJenny: Twelve years overdue.\nHe put a card on the desk.\nRené Benoit: Here's my number in case you change your mind.\nJenny: You'd better leave before I do.\nRené Benoit: I hope my daughter is as loyal to her father as you are to yours.\nHe leaves the house. Jenny is drinking a scotch.\nGibbs: You just let your personal obsession get in away of your professional responsability.\nJenny: That's a lot of crap, and you know it, Jethro. There no deals for men like him. You wanna chase after him right now and arrest him without a warrant, you go right ahead. But we both know that Kort will have him out before breakfast.\nGibbs: Then get your damn warrant.\nJenny: You get a warrant. But you'd better do it fast before his friends get him first.\nGibbs: If the weapon was loaded, and I wasn't here, would you have pulled the trigger?\nJenny: I guess we'll never know.\nHe put a charger on her desk and leave.\nJeanne's apartment\nZiva is a letter from Jeanne, she gives it to Tony.\nZiva: On the table.\nTony opens it and reads it, then he turned to Ziva a smile.\nTony: You ever lie to someone you love, Ziva?\nZiva: Yes\nTony: They ever forgive you?\nZiva: They never found out.\nTony: Mine found out.\nZiva: He told her.\nTony: No. I did.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTony and Jeanne are sitting on a bench in a park. La Grenouille is later.\nJeanne: I don't understand what's happening? Tony, that was your car. Your car that just... It could have been you. It should have been you.\nTony: Tell me you love me. Tell me.\nJeanne: I do. It's just everything that's happened... Happened today. Last night, the way you handled things, the gun. The gun firing it the way you did, and now this? It's like you're someone else, Tony. Someone else. Someone I don't know. What is it?\nIn his corner, la Grenouille yells on a phone.\nJeanne: You are, aren't you? Someone else. Who? Who are you?\nTony: I'm a federal agent. My name isn't Tony DiNardo, it's Anthony DiNozzo and I work for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service.\nJeanne: This is all been a lie. A lie?\nTony: Jeanne, listen to me. Not all of it, not everything. Just some things. Not the importants things.\nJeanne: Why? Just tell me why you did this. What it is I'm supposed to have done. Tell me.\nTony: It's not you.\nHe looks at la Grenouille.\nJeanne: What?\nTony: You should ask him.\nShe leaves, Tony is alone.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTony: Well he said she'd come back after she calmed down. I guess he was wrong.\nZiva: I will put out a BOLO. We will find her.\nTony: She doesn't wanna be found.\nZiva leaves and Tony lot sits against the couch.\nMcGee is on his computer, Ziva plays on her cell phone.\nMcGee: No luck?\nZiva: Not at home. And he's not replaced his cell phone yet.\nMcGee: Maybe he took the day off.\nZiva: Gibbs would have told us.\nGibbs arrives a coffee in his hand.\nGibbs: Gibbs would have told you officer David?\nZiva: If Tony was taking some time off.\nGibbs: Yeah, you're right. There always more work to be done when you're a man down on the shift. McGee?\nMcGee: I think I've got something here, boss. I found another one of la Grenouille's shell companies. Similar of the one that leased the stretch limo, only this one leases a yacht down at the Gangplank marina called the Mauritania.\nGibbs: How big?\nMcGee: Eighty feet, three state rooms. Ziva checked with the marina management. Someone's been staying there since Saturday. Older guy with an accent. They think he's French.\nGibbs: And a younger woman?\nZiva: No, he said he was alone.\nGibbs: Warrant?\nZiva: Just arrived from Legal. It is all in order. They could not guarantee it would not stop a concerted legal challenge from the Agency.\nGibbs: Yeah, let them try. Let's go.\nThe team takes its business.\nMarina\nThe team arrived at the marina to the boat. They are armed and boarded. They searched the boat but it is empty.\nZiva: He's gone.\nMcGee: Maybe he was never here.\nGibbs find la Grenouille's jacket.\nGibbs: He was here.\nThey descend from the boat.\nMcGee: We'll catch up with him eventually.\nZiva: Someone will.\nGibbs: One day.\nOn the boat, we see a silhouette. In the water floats the body of the frog, shot in the head.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

If we're going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I've long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?\nLeonard: What did you have in mind?\nSheldon: Well, off the top of my head, I'd have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.\nLeonard: It would be a replica of a movie prop.\nSheldon: Fair enough. It'd give you the right to rule a replica of England.\nLeonard: Well, they don't have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?\nSheldon: Mm. Tough decision. There's no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?\nLeonard: Just Bilbo Baggins' sword over there.\nSheldon: Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger; wouldn't we look silly? Okay, let's go for it.\nStuart: Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.\nLeonard: Yeah. It's okay, I guess.\nSheldon: Okay? It's magnificent.\nLeonard: Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?\nStuart: Oh, it's hard to put a price on something that's a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let's say 250?\nLeonard: Oh, that's pretty steep.\nStuart: Well, it's a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.\nSheldon: Only 8,000? We're wasting precious time. Buy it.\nLeonard: Hang on. Can you do any better?\nStuart: Are you kidding? I'm already giving you the friends and family discount.\nSheldon: Oh, did you hear that? We're getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.\nLeonard: Slow down. Two hundred.\nSheldon: What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.\nLeonard: Will you shut up?\nStuart: Tell you what, I'll go two thirty-five.\nLeonard: Nope. Maybe another time.\nStuart: Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.\nSheldon: Take it, take it.\nLeonard: Two hundred.\nStuart: Man, you're killing me!\nSheldon: Killing you? I can't breathe.\nStuart: Two ten, and I'm losing money.\nSheldon: Oh, now, we can't let him lose money, Leonard. I'm so sorry.\nLeonard: Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.\nStuart: Are you crazy? That helmet's signed by Robert Downey Jr.\nLeonard: So?\nStuart: Okay, if you're going to question the importance of an actor's signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!\nLeonard: Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.\nStuart: Thank you. I can eat meat this week.\nLeonard: See that? I just saved us forty bucks.\nSheldon: I've long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.\nStuart: You want me to wrap it?\nLeonard: No, it's okay. I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.\nWil Wheaton (entering): Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Ah, hey, Wil.\nSheldon: Hello, Wil Wheaton.\nWil: Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.\nSheldon: It's part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?\nWil: No.\nSheldon: I'm not surprised.\nStuart: Here's the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.\nWil: Awesome. What do I owe you?\nStuart: Forty bucks.\nWil: Good deal.\nSheldon: Sucker. Didn't even ask for the friends and family discount.\nWil: Hey, I'm having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.\nStuart: Will there be girls there?\nWil: Yeah, of course.\nStuart: 'Cause there wasn't last time.\nWil: There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nWil: All right, great. Later.\nSheldon: I see what you're doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we're going to be there, and when we don't show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.\nLeonard: I was actually thinking about going.\nSheldon: And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.\nLeonard: No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.\nStuart: Oh, great, more guys. It's gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest. Credits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon, can you grab me a water?\nSheldon: Possibly.\nLeonard: Can you or can't you?\nSheldon: It's not that simple, Leonard.\nLeonard: It never is, is it?\nSheldon: At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton's party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I'm characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger's Friendship.\nLeonard: Got it. Can I have my water?\nSheldon: Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.\nPenny: Wait, what is going on?\nSheldon: In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment...\nPenny: No, no, no, no, I didn't forget. Um, there's this cat in a box and until you open it, it's either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother's camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.\nAmy: Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You're the whole package, aren't you?\nHoward (arriving): Sorry I'm late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team's design for the deep field space telescope that's going on the International Space Station this spring.\nAll: Wow.\nBernadette: Howie, that's wonderful! Congratulations!\nHoward: It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.\nSheldon: Mohammed Lee.\nHoward: Who's Mohammed Lee?\nSheldon: Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn't know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.\nHoward: It's me, Sheldon. It's me. I'm going up in space! Technically, I'm an astronaut.\nAll: Wow, that's amazing!\nBernadette: Hang on a second. NASA doesn't have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?\nHoward: Oh, well, it's really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.\nBernadette: Are those Russian rockets safe?\nHoward: Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.\nLeonard: I'd like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard's making that a reality. We're all very proud of you.\nAll: Cheers.\nSheldon: That was a lovely toast. Kudos.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me.\nScene: Bernadette's car.\nHoward: You're really quiet. Is everything okay?\nBernadette: Fine. Just a little tired.\nHoward: I hope not too tired, because I'm feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.\nBernadette: I always catch your drift.\nHoward: All right, well, something's obviously bugging you. What is it?\nBernadette: I just can't believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.\nHoward: Oh, I get it. You're worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there's a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.\nBernadette: Just stop talking, Howard.\nHoward: This isn't the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.\nBernadette: What did you think was going to happen?\nHoward: Honestly? s*x.\nBernadette: Howard.\nHoward: Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?\nBernadette: Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We're supposed to be partners. We're supposed to be a team.\nHoward: I'm sorry. You're right. Okay, let's try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I'd like to discuss it.\nBernadette: Okay.\nHoward: I've been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?\nBernadette: Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.\nHoward: Hey, we're a team. So, what do you think?\nBernadette: No.\nHoward: No?\nBernadette: No.\nHoward: Well why not?\nBernadette: Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don't want to live that way with you.\nHoward: Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.\nBernadette: Oh, boo-hoo, you're not going to space!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Pretty cool about Howard, huh?\nSheldon: Don't talk to me as if nothing's happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.\nLeonard: For God's sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.\nSheldon: Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?\nLeonard: You never stop talking, do you?\nAmy: I don't understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton's party?\nPenny: Wil Wheaton is Sheldon's mortal enemy.\nAmy: Mortal enemy?\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nAmy: Sheldon, I know you're a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?\nSheldon: In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?\nPenny: Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.\nSheldon: You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This'll just take a moment. It's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.\nAmy: A floppy disk?\nSheldon: Well, I started the list when I was nine.\nAmy: How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?\nAll: Oh! Oh, God!\nSheldon: As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene: Howard's bedroom.\nBernadette: Howard?\nHoward: Change your mind about s*x? I'm still mad, but I'll do it.\nBernadette: No, I've just been thinking. It doesn't matter if I'm afraid for your safety. I don't want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.\nHoward: Thank you.\nBernadette: I love you.\nHoward: I love you, too. So, s*x now?\nBernadette: Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I'll be right back. (Exits)\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!\nBernadette: I'm ready.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?\nHoward: What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.\nRaj: Wow. You're not only our first astronaut. You're also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You're like a rock star.\nHoward: Little bit.\nLeonard: I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.\nSheldon: Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.\nLeonard: Going to Wheaton's party is not betraying you.\nSheldon: Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it's doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you're looking for.\nLeonard: I'm going to a party. I'm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!\nSheldon: Not yet.\nRaj: So, what's gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?\nHoward: I don't know. If we're going to get back together, she's going to have to apologize and accept that I'm a grown man who can make his own decisions.\nRaj: Then she's going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.\nHoward: Obviously.\nScene: Penny's apartment.\nBernadette: I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can't go to space. He's like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?\nAmy: You're kidding.\nPenny: No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.\nBernadette: I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't want to break up over this.\nPenny: Okay, why don't you just tell him you made a mistake?\nBernadette: Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?\nAmy: It's not for us to judge. We're just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you've done.\nBernadette: Oh, God, you're right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.\nPenny: Well, that, that's good. I'm glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.\nBernadette: What?\nPenny: Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?\nBernadette: I do, with all my heart.\nPenny: Got it. Just had to check.\nAmy: He's great.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: All right, Sheldon, we're going to Wil's. This is your last chance.\nSheldon: No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you're going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.\nLeonard: You want to drive?\nRaj: Sure.\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.\nLeonard: No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.\nSheldon: Brent Spiner?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: I don't care.\nLeonard: Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.\nSheldon: I did, but I think I've kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.\nLeonard: I'm going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.\nScene: Howard's bedroom.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, Bernadette's here!\nHoward: Tell her I'm not home!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!\nBernadette: Can we talk?\nHoward: You can. I have nothing to say.\nBernadette: All right. I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry I said something to your mother.\nHoward: I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.\nBernadette: I know. I'm sorry. I got scared.\nHoward: If you're gonna love me, you're gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.\nBernadette: I know.\nHoward: Well, don't say it if you're not gonna mean it, 'cause I'm not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.\nBernadette: Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.\nHoward: Well, those big kids were rocking it.\nBernadette: I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: You're my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.\nHoward: Right, right.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!\nScene: Wil Wheaton's party.\nRaj: Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nRaj: Well, I just met her gynaecologist!\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nSheldon: Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you're still my little buddy. I'm not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let's meet Brent Spiner and go home.\nWil: Hey, Sheldon, I'm so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.\nSheldon: What I'd like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.\nWil: This is for you.\nSheldon: An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.\nWil: I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn't show up.\nWil: Look at what I wrote.\nSheldon: To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.\nWil: It's my last one. I want you to have it.\nSheldon: Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!\nBrent Spiner: Oh, wow. I haven't seen one of these in years. (Rips open action figure packaging) Remember how we used to make these things look like they were m*st*rb*t*ng?\nSheldon: Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.\nBrent: Sorry, Slim. I've got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?\nSheldon: You've already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.\nWil: Don't worry. It doesn't take up a whole lot of your time.\nSheldon: Come on, buddy. Let's not waste another second on this loser. Love your house.\nLeonard: Can we get autographed dolls?\nBrent: Sure. Twenty bucks.\nLeonard: Ten.\nBrent: Eighteen.\nLeonard: Twelve.\nBrent: Sixteen.\nLeonard: Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.\nBrent: Done.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

But it could have been.\nFitz: Really? You really want me to detail for you how and where and in what positions Amanda Tanner and I had s*x? Would that help make you feel better? 'Cause I'll do it.\nOlivia: No.\nFitz: You left me. I was unhappy. She was there. One time. I-- I made a mistake.\nOlivia: I don't want to talk about it. You cheated on your mistress with your girlfriend. Let's just leave it at that.\nFitz: She wasn't my girlfriend. Don't you ever call yourself a mistress. We both know better.\nOlivia: Why are you here?\nFitz: Cyrus got this in the mail a week ago. It's a s*x tape. I'm on it. I need you to hear it.\nOlivia: I definitely don't want to hear you and Amanda Tanner having s*x.\nFitz: Olivia. I need you to listen to this.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGRANT CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS\nFitz: Well, there's no way to sugarcoat it. We got our ass handed to us by Sally Langston in Iowa last night. So, anyone have any great ideas? Anyone?\nJeannine: We have to swing farther right. We haven't said a thing about gay marriage, school prayer-\nFitz: Oh, come on. It's not our stances on the issues. We are not getting our message out there. People don't know where I stand. The problem is--\nOlivia: Your marriage. It looks like you don't screw your wife Which would be fine, except that family values matter to Republicans. It's why they vote for who they vote for. And since Sally's got Jesus firmly on her side, that just leaves family. Marriage. And yours, whatever the truth may be from the outside, it looks cold, distant, dead. Where is your wife, by the way? People want to like who they're voting for. Voters thought Al Gore was a big stiff until he stuck his tongue down Tipper's throat. They put George W. in office because he and Laura seemed like a fun couple to have a beer with. People have to want to invite you in for dinner; and right now, you and your wife are standing in their doorway, not looking at each other, letting in the cold air. That's why you lost Iowa. It's why you'll lose New Hampshire.\nFitz: And you are?\nOlivia: Olivia. Pope.\nFitz: Fire her.\nCyrus: Ah, she's great, right? A pistol. Lives for her work, a political nun, best student I ever had.\nFitz: Fire her.\nCyrus: 'Cause she said what every staffer on your campaign was afraid to say?\nFitz: Just get rid of her.\nOlivia: I'll charge my hotel room to the campaign. Don't worry. I haven't had a chance to raid the hotel minibar. Liv best of luck, Governor.\nCyrus: Let's be clear about something. I run a sausage factory.\nFitz: Which makes me ... sausage?\nCyrus: Handsome, highly qualified, smart, idealistic, and energetic sausage. The stump, the electrifying speeches, the baby kissing that's all you. The nitty-gritty, morally bankrupt, back-alley-brawling rest of the game, that's me. It's filthy and thankless, and it's my hallelujah, heroin, and reason to breathe. And you, you don't have half the stomach for it, so you go and you make nice with Olivia Pope. Get her back, or you can find another sausage maker.\nFitz: Ms.Pope? Ms. Pope, wait. I, I apologize for firing you.\nOlivia: Why?\nFitz: Why do I apologize?\nOlivia: Why did you fire me? I had a job, a paying job, from which I took a leave of absence to do a favor for my friend Cyrus because I am good. I am brilliant. I would eat, breathe, and live Fitzgerald Grant every minute of every day. You would be lucky to have me. Just because you don't like hearing the truth about yourself-\nFitz: I loved hearing what you had to say. I agree with every word. Very astute. And you're right. I would be lucky to have you. Look ...\nOlivia: This is why you fired me ...\nFitz: Can we just...?\nOlivia: Go back in there and work.\nFitz: Okay.\nOlivia: Okay.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN PANCAKE BREAKFAST / OLIVIA POPE'S APARTMENT\nFitz: Oh, it's perfect to meet you. Yeah, thank you for having us. How are you, Sally? Hi.\nOlivia: Put down the butter.\nAbby: I don't know what you're talking about.\nOlivia: I can hear my mixer again, Abby. Butter won't fix it.\nAbby: So are you a rabid Republican yet? Hello? Liv?\nOlivia: He's got ... something I can work with.\nAbby: Go to it then. You don't have to check on me every day. I'm not deranged. I'm just divorced.\nOlivia: So stop feeling sorry for yourself. Get out of my kitchen. Call my friend Stephen. He's fun.\nAbby: Stop trying to get laid. Maybe I'll buy a gun.\nOlivia: Ohh-kay. Bye!\nCyrus: Ooh, he's good, our boy. You'd never know he's dying to rip Langston's throat out.\nOlivia: If only he were that good at faking it with his wife we wouldn't be losing.\nAmanda: Schedule of events?\nOlivia: Thanks.\nCyrus: What's your name?\nAmanda: Amanda.\nCyrus: Thanks, Amanda. I don't care which campaign you're volunteering for, I want to thank you for coming out today.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nUS ATTORNEY'S OFFICE\nDavid: Alissa, cancel your plans. We're working late tonight.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGIDEON WALLACE'S APARTMENT\nQuinn: Mm. This is really good.\nGideon: I know.\nQuinn: No, I mean like award-winning good, like you should quit your job. 'Cause let's face it, you're kind of a crap reporter.\nGideon: Mm-hmm.\nQuinn: Go out on the road in your car and sell this grilled cheese. Wait. You have a car, right? 'Cause I can't date you if you don't have a car.\nGideon: I have a car. I also ... I have ... A deadline tomorrow.\nQuinn: Oh. Yeah, I sh- I'm sorry. I should go.\nGideon: No. No. I didn't mean that. You shouldn't go. You should stay. I just have to work for a couple of hours, but you should stay here, naked. And beautiful. And here, in my bed. Stay here. Please.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nUS ATTORNEY'S OFFICE\nDavid: Ah, did you get moo shu chicken? No wonder it took you so long. How do you even walk in those?\nAlissa: I got whatever you ordered. And these shoes aren't made for walking. They are made for getting me laid, specifically, they are for the very hot bartender at the Black Cat, where I would be having a drink right now if I didn't happen to work for an obsessive-compulsive slave driver who makes me fetch him dinner at 10:30 on a Thursday night.\nDavid: You know, if you spent less time at the Black Cat and more time studying for the bar exam, you wouldn't be fetching your boss anything because at law firms, they have assistants for that.\nAlissa: Lots of lawyers fail the bar.\nDavid: All lawyers pass the bar. That's what makes them lawyers. Alissa, eat something. We have a murder to solve.\nAlissa: No, we don't. Coroner says it's a suicide, and the police agree with her, which is why I went home two hours ago, because work was over.\nDavid: Amanda Tanner. 27. Single. 13 weeks pregnant. Worked as an aide at the Grant White House till just a couple weeks ago when she abruptly resigned and botched a suicide attempt. Then she becomes a client of Olivia Pope's, and we pull her dead body out of the river. Don't you find that interesting? Well, pretend you do, for me. Now if you did happen to find any of this remotely fascinating, incongruous, intriguing, worthy of our time, what's the first question you might ask about Amanda Tanner?\nAlissa: Well, um, who in the White House would want her dead?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN STOP\nMellie: You canceled all our events for the next two days? Yes.\nFitz: The primary's in less than a week. We can't miss two days of campaigning.\nCyrus: New Hampshire's a small state.\nMellie: I have a literacy fund-raiser in nashua tomorrow. I can't possibly cancel that.\nOlivia: That's why I canceled it for you.\nMellie: Maybe I'm dense, but I have to confess, I don't really know what you want from us.\nOlivia: First off, I'd like you to actually talk to each other.\nMellie: We talk all the time, Ms. Pope. Not to each other, you don't. House parties, town hall meetings, baseball games you barely look at each other.\nMellie: Fine. We will add a couple of events to the schedule where we are together.\nOlivia: That won't do it. You two need to be a couple. A believable, loving, dedicated couple. Or you might as we throw it in right now. Why don't we give you two a moment?\nFitz: Why are you fighting this? It's what you wanted. It's what you've always wanted.\nMellie: What I wanted? You are the one running for President.\nFitz: Oh, please, like you're not running for First Lady? You're dying to get into that White House. You're practically redecorating already.\nMellie: Okay, there it is. I am the ambitious monster. I'm the Iron Lady. I have done everything for you! I have sacrificed my career for you. I have had kids for you. There is not a single thing in my life I have not given up so that you could be President!\nFitz: I never asked you for any of that.\nMellie: And all I get in turn is this perpetual resentment!\nFitz: So what would you prefer? That I ignore you? That we don't talk at all? 'Cause that's pretty much how it's been the past few years, and that's worked okay.\nMellie: Now you're just being juvenile.\nFitz: Look, we BOTH know...\nCyrus: This is why they don't talk to each other.\nFitz: No ... 'Cause you're afraid it would get out and kill us politically.\nMellie: If they found out, we'd be dead in the water!\nFitz: Fine! Then if living on Pennsylvania Avenue is that important to you, we better suck it up and start acting like this isn't a dead marriage!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOUTSIDE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN STOP\nJames: Governor, you're 5 points down in New Hampshire. Taking time out from the primary for a parent-teacher conference isn't that a little risky?\nFitz: If it's a choice between losing touch with your family and losing a primary. That's not really a choice, is it?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY PREPARATION\nOlivia: You can't wear this tie on morning TV.\nFitz: What?\nOlivia: It's too distracting. Take it off. Give me your tie, please. Give me your tie. Take it off. Off, off, off, off. Thank you. Okay.\nFitz: You decide who you're voting for?\nOlivia: I'm apolitical.\nFitz: You don't sleep, you rip ties off innocent bystanders for me, you're killing yourself 24/7 to get me elected, and I don't even have your vote.\nOlivia: Well, you're gonna need to earn it, like any other candidate.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINTERVIEW WITH FITZ & MELLIE\nReporter: If my research is right, you were first in your class at Harvard Law.\nMellie: That's right. Oh, and uh, Fitz did fine, too.\nCyrus: Not bad.\nOlivia: They're still not touching.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGRANT CAMPAIGN ICE CREAM SOCIAL\nFitz: One more. There you go. One more.\nMellie: Very good job.\nOlivia: That's great.\nMellie: It's your turn. It's your turn, Fitz.\nFitz: Okay, it's my turn. Mm-hmm. Delicious!\nOlivia: Oh, wipe it off ... Wipe it off.\nCyrus: Wipe it off.\nOlivia: Wipe it. Wipe it off. Wipe it off, Mellie. Come on.\nCyrus: Come on.\nFitz: Oh. Thank you.\nOlivia: Perfect.\nMellie: Ice cream, anyone?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLANGSTON CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS\nSally: Ugh! Who in the holy hell is running that campaign?\nBilly: As far as I know, they haven't made any official changes.\nSally: Oh, yeah? That is a big, old pile of dung, Billy Chambers, and you know it. That is not the Fitzgerald Grant I ran against in Iowa. That is a candidate, Billy. A down-home, charming, red-blooded candidate who's stealing my votes. Hell, I'm halfway to voting for him. Now I want to find out who's responsible so we can see what we're dealing with here.\nBilly: I'm on it.\nSally: Billy, it is not in God's plan that I lose New Hampshire.\nBilly: Senator, I promise you, we will not lose New Hampshire.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGRANT CAMPAIGN STOP (NEW HAMPSHIRE)\nFitz: I'm a little superstitious, so we're not gonna have any victory speeches until tomorrow night, after everyone's voted. But for now, I just really want to say thank you. Okay? Thanks. It's all you guys.\nFitz: Olivia Pope I don't know how you do it.\nOlivia: Oh, if we're passing out credit, Governor, you and Mellie deserve most of it.

The polls have us up by-\nCyrus: Story's coming out in the morning paper, 6:00 A.M. They'll be reading about it over their damn coffee, right before they vote.\nOlivia: What story? What's coming out?\nCyrus: Mellie's having an affair.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRESTAURANT BAR\nTV: Senator Sally Langston won the New Hampshire Republican primary Tuesday, with 98% of the precincts reporting. Most attribute the voters' change of heart to new allegations that Governor Grant's wife is involved in an extramarital affair.\nBilly: Now you can't blame this one on me. You did a hell of a job with those two. The thing is, this isn't a story that goes away. You know, you can't spin a dead marriage. Sally and Doug, on the other hand ... they're like a couple of teenagers who can't keep their hands off each other. It's kinda gross, actually.\nOlivia: Billy Chambers.\nBilly: Thanks for meeting me, Olivia.\nOlivia: What do you want?\nBilly: Concede before South Carolina, and we'll give you the V.P. slot.\nOlivia: I'll take my check.\nBilly: Come on. You and I on the same team? We'd be unstoppable. We could play the spin machine, wrangle reporters, have nice meals on the trail. Do you like barbecue?\nOlivia: Are you asking me to concede or out on a date?\nBilly: Maybe a little bit of both.\nOlivia: I hate barbecue.\nBilly: You're awfully confident for someone who's got no cards left to play.\nOlivia: Oh, I always have cards left to play.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGRANT CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS / WASHINGTON D.C.

Cyrus, give us a minute. Huck, are you ready to reenter the real world today?\nMellie: Is he wearing pants?\nHuck: Paul Mosley. Literacy policy advisor for-\nMellie: We all know who he is. He was advising me on literacy. But that's it. End of story. I would never-\nFitz: Honey, it's not necessary. We believe you.\nHuck: They were following you. Did you know that?\nMellie: What?\nHuck: A guy like me, but, like, cleaner, has been following you for over seven months. Taking these photos, gathering evidence to use against you, just waiting for the chance.\nFitz: How'd you get these?\nHuck: Anything digital, it's all just out there. Patterns of ones and zeros waiting to be gotten.\nCyrus: All these late night meetings it doesn't look good.\nOlivia: And the story's picking up traction because Mosley's not denying it.\nCyrus: They must be paying him off.\nHuck: I pulled up all his financials. His password is \"literacy.\"\nOlivia: What's he got? Swiss accounts? Cayman Islands?\nHuck: Uh, just small amounts. Uh, tiny step productions. Here's another $4. 19.\nCyrus: Hardly damning. Keep looking.\nHuck: Well, small payments are interesting, too.\nFitz: Why is that?\nHuck: Well, he's been getting quarterly payments from Tiny Step Productions. Tiny ones going back 30 years.\nOlivia: You ready to try something new?\nAbby: I was thinking of going savory, but what's up?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTINY STEP PRODUCTIONS OFFICE\nAbby: Excuse me.\nReceptionist: Hello.\nAbby: What do you do here?\nReceptionist: We're a feature film company.\nAbby: Oh? What kind of films?\nReceptionist: Specialty films, ma'am.\nAbby: Like educational or ...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOUTSIDE GRANT CAMPAIGN BUS\nCyrus: No way!\nJames: No, no way what?\nCyrus: You lost your seat on the bus when you ran that Mosley- Mellie affair nonsense of a story without even running it by me.\nJames: I called for comment. You didn't pick up.\nCyrus: I expected more from you, James.\nJames: Don't bully me for doing my job, Cy. \"Times\" ran that story, too.\nCyrus: Claire, you're off the bus, too. Ask James why.\nFitz: Hey, Liv?\nOlivia: Yeah.\nFitz: We on top of this, getting this guy to come clean?\nOlivia: I'm on it.\nFitz: What does that mean, \"you're on it\"?\nOlivia: I got a guy.\nFitz: You got a guy? Another guy? Hells angel? Mobster? A kindhearted felon who owes you a favor?\nOlivia: Technically, he's on probation.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPAUL MOSLEY'S HOUSE\nTV: Don't forget the little pinkie toe. Mm! Mwah! Mm!\nHarrison: Toe sucking not my thing, but I admire the technique, no matter the application. And you, Paul Mosley, a.k.a. Brock\n\"The Mouth\" Stone hahaha! You got mad skills. You commit.\nPaul: Get the hell out of my house.\nHarrison: No wonder they made eight sequels of \"Twinkle Toes on Parade.\"\nPaul: I'm calling the cops.\nHarrison: Save your minutes. I already did. I figured they'd need a patrol or two to manage the media circus that's gonna be tearing up your front lawn in about four minutes. You see this, your toe-sucking highness, is your golden opportunity to fervently deny any remotely romantic involvement with Mellie Grant before you are a national joke and the entire literacy community that holds you in such high esteem reads all about your lengthy and decorated career as an artist of toe-rotica. Wow! Can I get an amen, Paul?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nREPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, SOUTH CAROLINA\nSally: We have the technology. We should aerial drone the hell out of our Southern borders and protect our legal citizens. Unless, of course, governor grant wants to open up his Santa Barbara ranch for amnesty ...\nKendal: The next question is for you, Governor Grant. Your marriage has received a lot of attention during this primary campaign. And while allegations of infidelity have been dismissed, criticism lingers amongst voters. Why do you think that is?\nCyrus: We knew it was coming.\nFitz: I think that a lot gets lost in translation between real life and packaged news footage. You can't capture 20 years of marriage in a in a snapshot. You can't capture chemistry with a photo op. I know what some people perceive and what the ... the whispers are, but ... The most honest thing that I can tell you about myself right now, Kendal, is that I'm a man in love with an incredible woman.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nHOTEL ELEVATOR\nCyrus: There's the man!\nCrowd: Whoo!\nCyrus: Congratulations!\nCrowd: Congratulations! Yeah! Uh-huh! Whoo!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGIDEON WALLACE'S APARTMENT\nGideon: Hi. This is Gideon Wallace from \"The D.C. Sun.\" We spoke last week about Amanda Tanner in 3-B. Yes, I do know what time it is. Hey, I know it's late, but I- do you know who's looking after Amanda's dog? I think it's a golden retriever. Do you know who's watching it for her? Her boyfriend? Really?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nUS ATTORNEY'S OFFICE\nAlissa: Look at these logs. This girl is signing into the White House at the crack of dawn and signing out in the wee hours, every day. You know what I think? I think work and play overlapped. Think about it. She never goes home, so where's she doing it? The White House, that's where. Oh, like you wouldn't.\nDavid: So she was sleeping with someone in the White House, as apparently, any red-blooded American would.\nAlissa: And plus, it's gotta be someone in the parts of the West Wing she's logging into.\nDavid: Come on.\nAlissa: That totally narrows it down.\nDavid: To 57 employees of the male persuasion. So the question remains who's her baby daddy?\nAlissa: Did you just say \"baby daddy\"?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGRANT CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS\nOlivia: I need the latest poll numbers for Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Arkansas, Oklahoma.\nWoman: I'm on it.\nOlivia: Super Tuesday is coming, people, and it's gonna kill us if we don't stay on top of it.\nFitz: Morning.\nOlivia: Good morning, Governor Grant. Did you need something?\nFitz: No, just ... no.\nOlivia: Good.\nFitz: I'm married.\nOlivia: I know.\nFitz: I'm running for President.\nOlivia: I know.\nFitz: I can't.\nOlivia: I don't want you to.\nFitz: But just stand here with me, for one minute. Let's not go back in there or talk or think or ... For one minute, we just stand here, and I'm not the candidate and you're not the campaign fixer. We're just us. One minute, for one minute. Just ... stand here with me.\nOlivia: One minute.\nMellie: Oh! Liv, there you are. You've really got to look at what they have me wearing at the town hall tonight. I really think it's too much.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGRANT CAMPAIGN BUS\nCyrus: Just got the tracking polls for Super Tuesday. You're still down with women. They're for Sally and they're not changing their mind.\nFitz: I crushed her in that debate. The whole country saw it.\nOlivia: It's hard to win over women when there's a viable female candidate in the race. We've been waiting a long time.\nFitz: So what do we do?\nCyrus: We've got the oppo on her. Three witnesses all willing to speak on the record about snorting coke at a frat party with Sally Langston, back when she was just a Tri Delt.\nOlivia: It won't work. You can't nail Sally Langston on morality. Sally found God, Cyrus. Once you find God, all is forgiven. That's kind of the point.\nCyrus: No, the point is we can't win without women.\nFitz: No. You take the opposition research and you put it in the garbage. We're playing the rest of the game above board, win or lose.\nCyrus: Okay.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGRANT CAMPAIGN EVENT, GEORGIA\nFitz: And that's exactly why I think deregulation is a good thing, like this pie. Do y'all really get to eat this all the time?\n'Cause if you do, I'll have to spend a lot more time down here.\nMellie: I'm sorry. I just I can't do this anymore.\nFitz: Mel?\nMellie: It's okay, honey, I just I need to say it. Um ... A few months ago, Fitz and I found out that we were pregnant with our third child. And we were so thrilled, so excited to bring a new life into our family. But campaigns can be so stressful, and I guess uh- I guess my body just couldn't handle it. And I lost our baby. Even though it was only eight weeks ... It was a baby and it was a member of our family and I have grieved for the loss of our child every day since. And I know that many of you have sensed, um, I don't know, distance between me and Fitz during the campaign, while we have struggled through this terrible experience as best we could. And I should say- Fitz wanted to quit to give us time to take care of each other, but I wouldn't let him, because I truly believe that he is the best person to be President of the United States, and I couldn't let our loss stand in the way of that.\nMellie: I think that ought to take care of it, don't you?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGIDEON WALLACE'S APARTMENT\nGideon: Hey, Marco. How's the night shift treating you? Cool. Did you get that coroner's report yet? Seriously? How far along? Hi. Gideon Wallace. \"D.C. Sun.\" Yeah, that's right. I called before. No, I didn't know you needed to be at work in an hour. Do you know Amanda's boyfriend? He's watching her dog? Works at the White House. You don't know his name? Lives in Logan Circle. All right. Thank you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nUS ATTORNEY'S OFFICE\nAlissa: Old. Old. Ugly. Psycho eyes. Ugly. Old. Old.\nDavid: I have learned so much tonight.\nAlissa: What about this guy? Robert Sullivan. Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security.\nDavid: Why him?\nAlissa: He's cute. But look at that smile. He could totally be a killer.\nDavid: You think whoever knocked her up was also the one who killed her?\nAlissa: Of course. It's always the boyfriend.\nDavid: Of course.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGRANT CAMPAIGN BUS\nOlivia: I was sorry to hear about your loss. Are you...? Is Mellie okay? If she needs to take a break from the campaign, I'm sure we could-\nFitz: Mellie's fine. She flew to Alabama. She's doing twelve campaign stops in two days. She's thrilled. Nothing keeps that woman down, not even a fake miscarriage. She's a real catch, my wife. I'm a lucky man.\nOlivia: I'm sorry.\nFitz: Oh, God. Please don't. Don't be nice to me. I'm sitting here complaining to you about my wife, which is sleazy and low and not fair to you and the oldest trick in the book. Suddenly I'm looking down at myself and I'm ... How did I get here? Why didn't I meet you sooner? What kind of a coward was I to marry her and not wait for you to show up?\nOlivia: Governor Grant ...\nFitz: Oh, for God sake, we are so far beyond the \"Governor Grant\" crap. Just say my name.\nOlivia: That's crossing the line. It would be inappropriate.\nFitz: Then let's be inappropriate. Say my name.\nOlivia: Fitz.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nHOTEL HALLWAY / HOTEL ROOM / UNKNOWN LOCATION\nCyrus: This is me.

Go in your room.\nFitz: Take off your clothes. (You're doing fine)\nMan: Yeah, I think I got something. Some woman. Nah, you can't tell who it is. They're not exactly talking. Yep.

I'm a huge fan of Senator Langston.\nBilly: Amanda. I won't forget this time. I promise.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOLIVIA POPE'S APARTMENT\nCD (Fitz): Take off your clothes.\nOlivia: Cyrus got this? In the mail? Someone's had this for two years. Why wait? Why now?\nFitz: All they had was a tape and a voice. They needed the voice. They needed a girl.\nOlivia: They needed Amanda Tanner.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nUS ATTORNEY'S OFFICE\nAlissa: If the baby's blood type is A, and Amanda's is B, then the father has to be either type A or type AB. We could subpoena the White House personnel files for the blood types.\nDavid: Alissa, we don't have enough to subpoena anyone for anything.\nAlissa: UGH but we are so close.\nDavid: We're not close. We have a suicide and a hunch. Go home.\nAlissa: What?\nDavid: Get some sleep. Study for the bar. Go shoe shopping.

Well, it's about your relationship with Amanda Tanner.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLANGSTON CAMPAIGN HQ\nSally: Thank you, Governor.

We are out of options.\nBilly: So what? We just ... no. No! He is a philandering faux conservative who will destroy everything, every single thing that we have promised to millions of people, honest Americans. What are we gonna say to them?\nSally: Tell 'em to vote. Vote Grant-Langston.\nBilly: This makes super Tuesday nothing, a blip. Just listen. All right, not for me, but for the future of our country.\nSally: Matthew 13:24. There's a parable about a group of enemies who plant bad seeds amongst the good ones to ruin the crops. The farmer notices weeds growing amongst the fruit. The servants ask the farmer if they should round up the weeds before the harvest, and what does the farmer say?\nBilly: \"Let them grow together.\"\nSally: One day, God will burn the weeds and save the fruit, Billy, but for now, let 'em grow.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOLIVIA POPE'S APARTMENT\nOlivia: You need to get back to the White House before the press corps comes in.\nFitz: Mm.

There's pictures of the two of you including several with her dog.\nBilly: Yeah. Yeah, I can see that. Can we just get right to the point here, Gideon? What are you saying exactly?\nGideon: I think you had a relationship with Amanda. I think you were her boyfriend.\nBilly: Is that it? Is that your big discovery, that we were boyfriend and girlfriend? That we held hands? Went steady?\nGideon: If I were the Vice President's Chief of Staff, that's not something that I would want people to know, especially considering that she-\nBilly: Morons.\nGideon: What?\nBilly: I'm surrounded by morons. Huge, clueless morons.\nGideon: I've got a story here.\nBilly: Yeah, genius, you do, only it's the wrong one. I'm not the story. The President's the story. The President is the one who slept with Amanda Tanner. I was your source in the White House. I sent you the pictures of Amanda and the President and the stupid dog. I sent you the West Wing logs. She visited him practically every day. Dear God, man, I did everything except draw you a picture of their stick figures doing it! All you had to do was put two and two together. What is it with people? Why are they so freaking stupid?! You, Amanda. It was an easy script for both of you. Big letters, small words. You could- you could follow it in your sleep.\nGideon: Oh, my God. You sent her in to sleep with the President.\nBilly: \"Oh, my God.\" You call yourself a journalist? You're a joke. You could have been the next Woodward and Bernstein and the best you can do is tell everyone that I had a relationship with a crazy dead girl? Good luck with that story.\nGideon: That's not all I came up with.\nBilly: You're an idiot. Whatever you say, I'll just deny it. This conversation never happened.\nGideon: According to the coroner's report, Amanda was 13 weeks pregnant. I bet it's your baby. I may be a joke, but \"Dead White House Intern Was Carrying V.P. Aide's Love Child\" that sure sounds like a story to me. I even have a copy of the coroner's report if you want to see it. Gotta believe they can run a DNA match between you and a fetus. This conversation might be easy to deny, but that sure as hell wouldn't be, would it? Let me just see where I put that. I'll show you. Aah!

Ok, all these people have been transferred from other hospitals.\nSydney: And I have the details.\nAlex: (To Sydney) If it's ok, I've gotta a case I need to check on.\n(Alex starts to leave and is stopped by Angry Lady)\nAngry Lady: My husband's not on that board.\nMan: Kelly Winters, she's not either.\nAngry Lady: What does that mean?\nAlex: It's...it's...they could be in shock or walked away from the site or...\nAngry Lady: Just say it. A lot of people died. They're dead.\nAlex: We don't know that.\nMan: So, how can we know?\nMan 3: My wife? She wasn't in these photos either but she's pregnant. Is it possible you just didn't see her?\nAlex: She's pregnant?\n(Lisa and Derek are at the scene. She looks very frightened and is trying to look around for some familiar landmark or person. Derek is holding her hand.)\nDerek: What? It's ok. Just think. Where is she? Which way did she go? It's ok. Take your time. Take all the time you need, you're doing great. What is it?\n(Lisa spots a red cross sign and walks toward it)\nDerek: Good.\n(They stop on the dock. Lisa stares out into the water.)\nDerek: Ok, use your words. Where exactly is Meredith.\n(She points into the water and Derek looks terrified)\n(Meredith is still sinking and then the scene changes to Jane Doe's surgery)\nBurke: The leak in the heart is coming from the right atrium.\nAddison: Are you gonna put her on bypass cause that could compromise the baby.\nBurke: No, I can fix her heart while it's still beating. Push 40 milligrams of abizonole.\n(Alex enters)\nAlex: Found her husband. I found him. She's not a Jane Doe. Her name's Casey. Casey Clarke. (Addison gives him a look) What?\nAddison: How do you know?\nAlex: What?\nAddison: How do you know it's Casey Clarke?\nAlex: Well she's pregnant and...\nAddison: There were hundreds of people on that ferry, Alex. Hundreds. And chances are that more than one were pregnant. Now, do not give that man hope unless you are certain. Do not give him hope until you've checked every last body in the morgue.\nAlex: Dr. Burke can I, uh...(He holds up the camera)\nBurke: Yes, make it fast.\n(Alex leaves)\nAddison: I gotta tell ya, this group of interns...\nBurke: Emotional.\nAddison: Head strong.\nBurke: Hot headed, stubborn, they think they know everything. And you can only give them so much rope before they hang themselves with it. It's like they lose all rationality. They won't listen to reason.\nAddison: Geez Preston, don't hold back.\n(The monitor starts beeping)\nAddison: It's getting hypotensive. All right, I'm seeing some late decels in the fetal heart monitor. Baby is not getting enough blood.\nBurke: Almost...just got one...more stitch. Got it, turn on the Echo.\nAddison: Baby's heart rate stabilized.\nBurke: Hmm, think we've seen the worst of it.\n(Alex enters the stairwell where George is squatting and looking at a map of the hospital)\nAlex: What's the deal?\nGeorge: Do you know how massive this hospital is? How many people, not just sick people, not to mention, if I'm a little kid, how many places can I hide. He's little. A little kid could hide anywhere.\nAlex: What you're looking for a kid?\nGeorge: Yeah. His mom's in surgery and I um...if I don't find him Bailey will...well to start she'll change her son's middle name to Elvis or Tupperware or...I'm not kidding, anything will be better than George.\nAlex: I know a place a kid might be.\nGeorge: Really.\n(George and Alex are in the morgue. Alex is taking pictures)\nGeorge: You could have warned me.\nAlex: You didn't check down here, right?\nGeorge: No.\nAlex: So, stop whining and tell me if you find a pregnant chick. You know, you're not the only one with a detail that sucks. You know, I'm supposed to deal with these freaked out families. I'm not good with people; they should just let me stick to patients.\nGeorge: Patients are people, especially kids.\nAlex: You know what I mean.\nGeorge: He's face down. How does that...? Come here and help me turn his body right.\nAlex: Dude.\nGeorge: Don't tell me it doesn't matter. God, I swear to...\nAlex: Dramatic much?\nGeorge: This doesn't bother you? Any of this? All this death, it doesn't mean anything to you?\nAlex: I'm working, why would it?\nGeorge: Yeah but I was working when...Caucasian female about 30 years old. She's...she's pretty. She looks about 7 months pregnant.\n(Alex takes a picture)\n(The scenes, Greg is holding the phone up)\nRichard: Now remember Stevens that drill just isn't going to stop like a neurosurgical drill. So, as soon as you feel the release in pressure, stop the drill or you'll pierce his brain.\nIzzie: Even if I don't see blood?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Mark and Richard are in an x-ray room)\nMark: Trust your instincts Stevens, trust the feel of it.\nIzzie: I'm ready. No, wait, I need to clean the drill off, one more time.\nRichard: You've cleaned it a dozen times Stevens, it's as clean as it's gonna get. You ready?\nIzzie: Yes.\nRichard: Ok, place three fingers above the ear and two or three fingers in front of that on the side where the first pupil blew.\nIzzie: Got it.\nRichard: All right, now use the scalpel to make a vertical scalp incision down to the skull.\nFriend: Jeez.\nIzzie: I see a lot of blood, a lot.\nMark: Superficial bleeders, nothing to worry about.\nRichard: Are you at the skull?\nIzzie: Yes.\nRichard: Drill a hole in the middle of the incision.\n(Friend hands her a power drill)\nVince: Oh, god.\nIzzie: Ok, that can't happen. Do you understand me? Sounds can't happen. Freaking out can't happen. Because if you freak out, I'm gonna freak out. And I'm the one holding a power drill to your friend's brain. So, if you're gonna vomit, if you're gonna make sounds, step away. If you're gonna stay here you have to pull it together, ok?\nVince: I'm good, doc.\nIzzie: Ok, I'm ready.\nMark: The temporal bones only gonna be a couple millimeters thick.\nIzzie: Ok, I'm in. But the dura looks fine.\nRichard: You're gonna have to go in again.\nIzzie: Frontal lobe, right?\nRichard: That's right. Just behind the hairline, a few centimeters off the midline.\nMark: This bone will be thicker, about five times as think as the temporal bone.\nIzzie: Ok, got it. Second hole down.\nMark: What do you see?\nIzzie: I think I see...blood. I see blood.\nRichard: Ok, now this is important. Drill around the hole to expand the opening. You have to try and relieve the pressure.\nIzzie: Ok. Ok. The hole is about 2 centimeters around now. I see blood, I definitely see blood.\nRichard: Try to evacuate as much of the clot as you can.\nIzzie: With what? I don't have suction.\nMark: Use your finger, gauze, anything.\nIzzie: I see clotted blood.\nRichard: No arterial?\nIzzie: No.\nRichard: Good, now how does the dura look? Is it bulging or does it look lax?\n(Mark and Richard both look proud of Izzie)\nIzzie: Looks like it's pulsating regularly with the heartbeat. That's another good, right?\nRichard: That's great, Stevens. If it's pulsating that means blood and oxygen are entering the brain. Now, pack it with gauze so you can minimize the bleeding.\nIzzie: Ok, get the rescue rig in here.\nRichard: Nicely done, Stevens.\nVince: Is that it, is he gonna be ok?\nIzzie: We've relieved the pressure on his brain but he's still got a lot of other injuries.\nFriend: Hey, his eyes are open.\n(They all have a moment of relief)\n(Lisa is standing on the dock staring into the water when a coast guard officer walks up)\nCoast Guard: Hey kid! Kid! You ok? You need to come with me. Kid?\n(He picks Lisa up and starts to carry her away. As he is walking you hear coughing and then Derek walks onto the dock with a very blue and very, very lifeless Meredith in his arms)\n(Derek is in the ambulance performing CPR on Meredith)\nDerek: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nParamedic: ETA's five minutes.\nDerek: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n(Derek continues CPR with no response from Meredith)\n(George enters Carly's OR)\nGeorge: How is she doing?\nBailey: Good, no intestinal damage. Missed all her vital organs, she's almost done here. You find her son?\nGeorge: I've looked everywhere. I've been in contact with the scene, with Mercy West, with Seattle Presbyterian, I've checked in the...he's lost. Or...Or, uh.\nBailey: He's in the water. So, when she wakes up I get to inform her that she's not going to die, she's just gonna want to die.\nGeorge: I'm sorry, I'll...I'm gonna keep looking.\nBailey: Yeah, you do that.\n(Izzie arrives at the hospital with Rick in the ambulance. Richard rushes out to greet her.)\nIzzie: His right pupils not dilating anymore. He's normal tensive but his pulse is still up in the 130's.\nRichard: Ok, what's his neurological status?\nIzzie: GCS is eight. I'm sorry, I ran out of sterile drapes, I had to use some guys t-shirt. It wasn't sweaty or anything, he was a clean guy but...\nRichard: Ok, call the OR, tell them we're coming up.\nIzzie: I also dropped the scalpel in the field and by that time I had used all the alcohol swabs on the drill bit. So, I think we should load him up on antibiotics. Lots and lots of antibiotics.\nRichard: Stevens, you put a drill through a man's skull and didn't hit his brain. You saved his life. Get cleaned up and get to the OR, you've got work to do.\nIzzie: The OR?\nRichard: Yes, the OR, you're officially off of probation.\n(Izzie passes Cristina in the hall)\nIzzie: Oh, Cristina! Oh my god, you are not gonna believe what I just did. I'm gonna tell you but you are not gonna believe it. You're gonna think I made the whole thing up.\nCristina: You're back? Wait, is Meredith back?\nIzzie: I drilled a hole into this guy's skull.\nCristina: What?\nIzzie: Several holes actually, with a drill I borrowed from a guy named Vince. Packed the whole with freaking tissue then brought him back here and now I get to scrub in on his craniotomy.\nCristina: So, you haven't seen Meredith.\nIzzie: It was like a ride, this crazy roller coaster ride with like adrenaline shooting out of my ears. You think that my hands would be shaking but they weren't, there was no shaking. Did I mention the drill?\nCristina: Ok, Izzie, I get it. You are a hero, I am jealous. But I need to know where the hell Meredith is.\nIzzie: Ok...I don't know where the hell Meredith is but...she should be back here. I didn't see her at the scene. The scene where I was a rockstar, by the way. Did I mention I'm off probation?\n(Izzie starts to walk away and Cristina gives her a look)\nIzzie: Rockstar!\n(Alex is in the clinic and has the pictures of the dead people from the ferry accident)\nAlex: These photos are fatalities. I know it's difficult but please try to ID who you can.\n(The people go to the board and slowly take the pictures of their loved ones. Alex is finally touched by the situation)\n(Rick's OR)\nMark: We've agreed to let you do the honors. A few more burr holes to start the craniotomy.\nIzzie: Really?\nMark: You saved his life, you might as well help finish what you started. After I strip off the periosteom you can see what a high-speed neurosurgical drill feels like.\nIzzie: Drill, please.\n(Izzie holds the drill smiling)\n(Alex is in the clinic and sees the devestation of the crowd. He looks around and understands all of it finally. He walks up to the husband of the pregnant woman)\nMan 3: I have...we have two pregnant women. One of them is...she's in bad shape. She's pretty beat up. She might be hard to recognize.\nMan 3: That...I don't know. What color's her hair?\nAlex: Brown, reddish.\nMan 3: My wife is blonde, brownish but blonde.\nAlex: Well sometimes the blood makes it look darker like that, red. I know you can't tell from the photo but her eyes their pretty distinctive.\nMan 3: Casey's eyes are very distinctive.\nAlex: Brown but not that really dark, dark brown but golden and really warm.\nMan 3: It's not her. Casey's are blue, very, very blue.\nAlex: I'm sorry.\nMan 3: I thought you said you...had two pregnant women.\nAlex: Yeah, we um...the other one is um...she's...\nMan 3: Oh, god...oh no...Casey. Oh, Casey.\n(Alex sees the loss around the room)\n(The ambulance with Derek and Meredith arrive and Bailey is in the ambulance bay to get it)\nBailey: What do we got?\nParamedic: Jane Doe, hypothermic, drowning.\nDerek: She's not Jane Doe, it's Meredith Grey. It's Meredith.\nBailey: Derek! Derek, Derek, how long she been down?\nDerek: I don't know. She's alive, she's alive.\nBailey: Derek!\nDerek: She's alive.\nBailey: Ok, look. I need you to help me get her inside. (Loudly) Clear a trauma bay, stat! Move it!\n(Burke walks up to Cristina who is in the ER still doing sutures)\nCristina: How was your surgery Dr. Burke?\nBurke: Well, the patient is out of the woods now, Dr. Yang. Thanks for asking.\n(Cristina yanks the stitch she is doing)\nPatient: Ow!\nCristina: You're numbed.\nPatient: Whatever. It looked harsh.\nCristina: (To Nurse) Here, finish this please.\n(Cristina walks into an empty room and Burke follows her)\nBurke: What is your problem?\nCristina: You know, everyone's back. Everyone's back except here. And I listened to her, everyday about her McLove life and McDreamy and McCrap. And on the one day, the one day I have a thing...she's disappears.\nBurke: Meredith? This is about Meredith.\nCristina: She doesn't know yet.\nBurke: Meredith?\nCristina: She's my person!\nBurke: Right. And if Meredith doesn't approve, then what?\nCristina: No, no, no. This is not about getting her approval. It's about...\nBurke: What?\nCristina: Telling her...makes it...makes it...if I murdered someone, she's the person I'd call to help me drag the corpse across the living room floor.\nBurke: Ok, see now, you're likening someone here to a corpse. I'm done.\nCristina: She's my person.\n(Burke leaves and Cristina's pager goes off)\n(Rick's OR)\nDoctor: Removing the bone flap.\nIzzie: Ready with suction.\nMark: Looking good.\nIzzie: Yes, yes it is.\n(Izzie's pager goes off)\nNurse: Dr. Stevens, it's your pager.\nIzzie: That's ok. It can wait.\nNurse: I think you wanna take this page.\n(Alex is looking in on Jane Doe, Addison is in the room)\nAlex: How's she doing?\nAddison: She's holding steady for now. Anybody claim her yet?\nAlex: No, she's still a Jane Doe. I'd notice.\nAddison: What?\nAlex: If you went missing, I'd notice.\n(Alex goes to leave and his pager goes off)\n(George is sitting on the steps near the OR board looking at Chris' picture. He stands up and looks at the board noticing there is a seven year old boy in surgery)\n(Callie's OR)\nCallie: All right, I need a little more suction here, please.\n(George enters)\nGeorge: Callie?\nCallie: O'Malley, I'm working. What do you want?\nGeorge: I read on the board you're doing an internal fixation of the lumber spine on a John Doe from the ferry crash, age 7.\nCallie: That's right.\nGeorge: Can I see his face?\nCallie: I'm in the middle of surgery.\nGeorge: I know.\n(He walks over and holds a picture up)\nGeorge: Is this boy you're patient? (Callie scoffs) I know the pictures half smeared and hard to see. Please tell me it's him, tell me he's been right here under my nose, open on your table all day and not drifting along the bottom of the ocean. Please tell me that.\nCallie: Hold the picture under my light so I can get a better look. Oh yeah, oh yeah. I could spot those goofy ears anywhere.\nGeorge: Really?\nCallie: Really.\nGeorge: Callie O'Malley, I can't kiss you right now cause you're scrubbed in but tonight when you get home, I am going to...\nCallie: All right, ok, all right. People lets focus here, George I'm working.\nGeorge: Yeah.\nCallie: I'm...I'm working.\nGeorge: Ok.\nCallie: So, yeah. Bye.\n(George's pager goes off and he leaves)\n(Lisa is standing in the clinic alone when a lady rushes up to her)\nLady: Oh my god! Oh my god! You're safe, you're safe! Oh honey, mommy's so sorry she got lost. Lisa!\n(Meredith's trauma room)\nDerek: They put a 20 gauge IV in but I think it blew.\nBailey: I'll start a central line but you have to get out of the way.\nDerek: We put 3 milligrams of epi down the ET tube...\nBailey: Derek!\nDerek: ...this was three minutes ago we should push...\n(Richard enters)\nRichard: Shepherd, get out!\nDerek: I think we should push just one atropine...I think I saw some reactivity in the pupils before the atropine and I think...she might have actually had some cardiac...\nRichard: Shepherd, get out!\nDerek: We need to put an external pacer on just to be sure.\nRichard: We need to save her life. You can't do this, we need to do this. Now go! Go.\n(Derek goes in the hall)\nBailey: Ok, she has a new 18 gauge in her left AC push 1 of epi through it.\n(Burke walks into the hall and peeks in Meredith's room. Derek is sitting in the hall looking devastated and lost)\nBurke: The chief is working on her, man.\nDerek: He threw me out.\nBurke: What do you need?\nDerek: I need you to go in there.\n(Burke enters the room)\nRichard: Give me a new warm blanket her temps still only at 80 degrees.\nBurke: What can I do?\nRichard: She needs an ABG.\n(Monitors start beeping)\nRichard: Whoa, was that V-fib. Charge to 300. Lets go, lets go, lets go. Clear.\n(Addison enters)\nRichard: Back to asystole. Keep compressions going.\nAddison: Oh, my god.\nBurke: She's hypothermic.\nAddison: Uh, have you tried a warm peritoneal lavage? Or even, a continuous bladder lavage with warm fluids? Could do a thoracotomy.\nRichard: Get back to the ABG. Come on, lets go people.\n(Derek is sitting in the hall, Mark walks up and looks down at him. Derek nods and Mark sits down next to him. Mark puts his hand on Derek's arm)\n(Meredith's room. She is still blue)\nBailey: How's her temp?\nRichard: Only up to 81 now.\nAddison: Come on, Meredith. Don't do this.\n(A nurse leaves the room and Addison glances out the door to see Mark and Derek sitting in the hall)\n(Izzie, Alex and George are standing on the other side of a door, looking down the hall at Derek. Cristina walks up)\nCristina: It's Meredith?\nAlex: Yeah.\nCristina: Are you sure? Did you see her? Because it could be...\n(Alex grabs her arm)\nAlex: It's Meredith.\nCristina: Oh. Oh. Oh.\nIzzie: She will come through this.\nGeorge: You don't know that.\nIzzie: She will come through this.\nGeorge: People die.\nIzzie: I know people die. People die in front of us everyday. But I believe Meredith will survive this. I believe...I believe...I...I believe in the good. I believe that it's been a hell of year and in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary we will all be ok. I believe a lot of things. I believe that...I believe that Denny is always with me. And I believe that if I eat a tub of butter and no one sees me the calories don't count. And I believe that surgeons who prefer staples over stitches are just lazy. And I believe that you are a man who made a terrible mistake marrying Callie. And I believe that because I am your best friend I can tell you this and we will be ok. I believe even though you made this mistake you will be ok. I believe we survive, George. I believe that believing we survive is what makes us survive.\n(She's hugs Cristina)\nIzzie: She's gonna be ok.\n(Meredith's room)\nRichard: Push another epi. How many is that?\nBailey: This is our fourth room, sir.\nBurke: We've been here 20 minutes.\nAddison: Still in asystole.\nRichard: We're losing her.\n(Meredith flatlines)\n(Meredith appears to wake up, coughing and sputtering. She sits up and next to her is Dylan)\nDylan: Hi.\nMeredith: Hey. Am I...?

        "prompt_0": "\"A Boy in a Bush\"\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Fade in: Auditorium. From a podium on stage, Dr. Brennan is giving a lecture to a large group of anthropology students. Behind her shines a slide showing a variety of what look to be skull fragments.]\nBRENNAN: As far back as 1938, the director of the F.B.I., J. Edgar Hoover, wrote to the then curator of the Jeffersonian Institution, Professor Daniel Payne, to aid in the evaluation of specimens who were thought to be irrefutably human. This was the result.\n[She changes the slide, and a drawing of an ape appears. The students laugh.]\nBRENNAN: Despite this early disagreement, the F.B.I. and the Jeffersonian have forged a mutually beneficial, if somewhat tense, relationship which survives to this day. Thank you.\n[The students applaud and Goodman steps to the podium.]\nGOODMAN: Thank you, Dr. Brennan. Are there any questions?\n[A girl in the audience raises her hand.]\nOS: GOODMAN: Yes?\n[She stands.]\nFEMALE STUDENT: How much money have you made from your book?\nBRENNAN: I don't really know. I have an accountant and an agent-\nGOODMAN (cutting her off): That's not really the kind of question we're looking for from an anthropology student.\n[A boy in the hand is called on.]\nOS: GOODMAN: Yes?\n[He stands.]\nMALE STUDENT: Did you get your agent before or after you wrote the book?\n[Brennan moves toward the podium to answer, but Goodman speaks first.]\nGOODMAN: People, Dr. Brennan is an accomplished forensic anthropologist who writes books on the side.\n[In the audience, Booth stands from among the students.]\nBOOTH: I have a question regarding role of the F.B.I. in your book: Who do you base the brilliant and insightful Special Agent Andy Lister on?\nGOODMAN: Oh, for God's sake.\nBOOTH: Because, you know, I'm pretty sure it was me.\nBRENNAN: What are you doing here, Booth?\n[Cut to: Outside the building, Brennan and Booth are walking side-by-side toward the parking lot.]\nBOOTH: Local police got an anonymous call saying that there were human remains in a field behind a mall in the suburbs.\nBRENNAN: I did an anthropological profile of the suburb as a grad student. The whole notion of a created community, a modern utopia with its own mores and rules... It's fascinating.\nBOOTH: Fascinating to who?\nBRENNAN: To \"whom\".\nBOOTH: Whom. (He sees the shiny, silver sports car they've walked up to and laughs) You've got to be kidding.\nBRENNAN: What? My publishers gave it to me.\nBOOTH: Gave it to you?\nBRENNAN: Book sales are pretty good. It's supposed to be a nice car.\nBOOTH: Gave it to you?\nBRENNAN: Yeah.\nBOOTH: Well, why'd you park crooked?\nBRENNAN: Well, the guy said to always park it like that.\nBOOTH: He's wrong. It makes you look like an idiot.\nBRENNAN: How about I drive for once?\nBOOTH: No, I cannot show up at a crime scene in that.\nBRENNAN: Why?\nBOOTH: Because it would detract from the gravity of my F.B.I. presence. Especially if you parked crooked.\nBRENNAN: Why is the F.B.I. involved in the search for human remains behind a suburban mall?\n[Booth pulls a paper out of his jacket and hands it to her.]\nBOOTH: Because this boy is missing.\n[The paper is a missing person flier with a picture of a young boy on it.]\nBRENNAN: Oh... A child.\nBOOTH: Yeah.\n[Cut to: The field behind Clayton Hills Mall. The parking lot is filled with vehicles, among them squad cars and a coroner's van. Booth, Brennan, and Zack are speaking with a police officer.]\nPOLICE OFFICER: Anonymous call came in a couple hours ago. No sign of him yet.\nBOOTH: How do you know it wasn't a prank?\n[The officer starts a recording of the call.]\nGIRL (on cassette player): You have to come right away! There's, like, a dead kid here, all rotted away! It's in the field behind Clayton Hills Mall. You better come!\nBOOTH: Well, that rings true.\nBRENNAN: Why anonymous?\nPOLICE OFFICER: Kids come here to party, misbehave.\nBRENNAN: Adolescents and preadolescents tend to seek out their own space to establish their own society, to counter parental influence.\nPOLICE OFFICER: You mind if I make an observation?\nBRENNAN: No, of course not.\nPOLICE OFFICER: In your book, the cops come off as very one-dimensional. Why is that?\nBRENNAN: You mean two-dimensional.\nZACK: One-dimensionality exists only in theory as a mathematical value.\nPOLICE OFFICER: Okay. Really looking forward to your next book.\n[He exits.]\nBRENNAN: Did you bring the thermal imager?\nZACK: I don't think we need it.\n[Brennan gives him a look.]\nZACK: It makes me look like the Great Gazoo.\nBRENNAN: I don't know what that means, but we definitely need it, Zack.\n[He sighs and walks off.]\n[Cut to: A bit later, in the field. Zack is wearing the thermal imager, which looks like a large orange and yellow helmet over his head. We see Booth and Brennan through his point of view, in yellows, greens, and reds based off of thermal heat.]\nBOOTH: How's it going there, Darth? See anything on Saturn? (off of Brennan's look) Oh, please tell me you've seen at least one Star Wars movie.\nBRENNAN: When I was seven, and leave Zack alone.\n[Back to normal view.]\nZACK: Can we please hurry up? It's stuffy in here.\n[They begin to walk.]\nZACK: I should be able to see any heat residue released from decomposing bodies.\n[They happen upon a small area where there obviously used to be a fire. Some crates and various garbage surround it.]\nOS: BOOTH: Party central.\nBRENNAN: Because suburbs are so homogeneous, adolescents tend to rebel in predictable and uniform ways. Fire, illicit substances, wayward behavior.\nBOOTH: Do you think that wayward behavior would include abducting a six-year-old child?\nBRENNAN: It's pretty extreme. Adolescents are more likely to drink alcohol and listen to culturally inappropriate music at high volume.\nZACK: I'm picking something up.\n[From his POV, we see mostly green as he walks through grass, but then a patch of yellow, signifying some heat, appears.]\n[Back to normal view, Zack takes the imager off of his head.]\nZACK: Oh my God.\nBOOTH: What? Why'd you stop?\nZACK: You can turn on your flashlight. Aim it over there.\n[He pulls back some high grass and we see the mostly decomposed body of a young child.]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[TITLE CREDITS]\n[Fade in: The Jeffersonian Medico-Legal Lab. The child's body is laid out on a table on the raised center platform.]\nBRENNAN: Before proceeding with maceration, any general observations? Zack?\nZACK: Epiphyseal fusion puts the age at approximately six to ten years, though the stature suggest younger.\nBRENNAN: Good. I concur. Cause of death?\nZACK: Blunt trauma to the chest.\n[Brennan walks over to Angela, concerned.]\nBRENNAN: Are you all right?\nANGELA: He's so small. That's all. Go on with your work. I'm okay.\n[Brennan returns to the table.]\nHODGINS: The remains were significantly degraded by insect and animal activity, mostly dog and rodent. Despite the condition of the body, he's been dead between only thirty-six to forty-eight hours.\nBRENNAN (gesturing towards the victim's clothes): These were found a few yards from the body. Notice that they are in perfect condition. What does that tell you?\nZACK: The victim wasn't wearing them when he was killed.\nBRENNAN: Which suggests he was sexually assaulted.\n[Angela approaches the table and hands a sheet of paper to Brennan.]\nANGELA: I'm done.\n[Brennan takes the sketch and walks to a computer screen, where the missing flier is displayed, to compare.]\nBRENNAN: I think we have a match. The clothing matches. It's Charles Gregory Sanders.\n[Cut to: The Sanders house.]\nOS: BOOTH: On behalf of the F.B.I., we're extremely sorry for the loss of your son.\n[Cut to: Inside. Booth is talking with Charles' mother, Margaret Sanders, and one of the Sanders' neighbors, Ellie Nelson.]\nBOOTH: And I have a few questions, I mean, only if you're up to it.\n[Margaret nods.]\nBOOTH: You have two other sons?\nMARGARET: Foster sons. Though I try not to make the distinction.\nELLIE: Shawn and David Cook. They are brothers. I live right next door.\nBOOTH: Charlie was your own?\nMARGARET (voice breaking): Yes. Charlie was mine.\nBOOTH: What about Mr. Sanders?\nMARGARET: We divorced shortly before Charlie was even born. He works overseas.\nELLIE: He doesn't even send child support.\nBOOTH: You mind if I ask how you afford this nice neighborhood?\nMARGARET: Child Services wouldn't allow a single mother to foster if she worked. I live off the proceeds of a generous trust fund my parents set up long ago.\nBOOTH: And the day that Charlie disappeared - all three boys went to the park?\nELLIE: It's two blocks away. It's a very safe neighborhood. They walk farther to school.\nMARGARET: We all keep an eye out for each other around here. People are good neighbors, take an interest.\n[A door opens in the background.]\nOS: SKYLER: Mom?\nMARGARET: In here, Skyler.\n[Skyler Nelson enters with Shawn and David Cook.]\nELLIE: This is my son, Skyler.\nSKYLER: Dad told me to bring the boys back. We gotta go on a job.\nDAVID: There's nothing to do here.\nSHAWN: Our video game's broke.\nMARGARET: Shawn, David, this is Agent Booth. He's gonna find out what happened to Charlie.\nDAVID: How're you gonna figure it out?\nBOOTH: Oh, I'm in the F.B.I. We always figure it out. Boys, I mean, if it's alright with your mother, maybe I could help you out with your video game.\n[Margaret nods, and the boys head off with Booth following behind them.]\n[Cut to: Brennan's office. All the squints are gathered there.]\nGOODMAN: These are invitations to a banquet.\n[He hands an envelope to Brennan.]\nBRENNAN: You called a special meeting to invite us to a party?\nGOODMAN: Don't this of it as an invitation, consider it a summons. It's for donors.\n[He moves to Hodgins, who stands.]\nHODGINS: Meet and greet, press the flesh, butt kiss...\nGOODMAN: I don't like it any more than you do, but these people fund our research, and all they want in return is to rub elbows with a scientist every once in awhile.\n[He walks toward Angela.]\nHODGINS: I can't make it.\nBRENNAN: Yeah, me neither.\nANGELA: I have a date that night.\nGOODMAN (handing her an invitation): You don't even know when it is.\n[Zack raises his hand.]\nGOODMAN (passing him an envelope as well): Yes, Mr. Addy?\nZACK: What kind of food will there be?\nGOODMAN: When I said you should think of this invitation as a summons, I understated. It's a subpoena. A grand-jury subpoena. Ignore it at your own peril.\nBRENNAN: You're not gonna fire us if we don't go.\nGOODMAN: No, not fire you, but I can move your parking spot to Lot M. Enjoy the shuttle ride.\nZACK: The shuttle smells like feet.\nBRENNAN: I know when I'm beat. I'm in.\nANGELA: What the hell, it's a party.\nZACK: Do I have to wear a tie?\nGOODMAN: Formal wear. I've arranged for a limo to pick us up here.\nHODGINS: Not me. I'm not afraid of parking or feet.\nZACK: Wait, you drive me to work. You can't just think of yourself.\nGOODMAN: Repercussions and consequences, Dr. Hodgins. I'm your boss, and you will go to this banquet.\n[Hodgins snaps a rubberband that's around his wrist as Goodman exits, and Angela takes notice.]\n[Cut to: The Sanders house. Booth is helping the kids with their video game.]\nDAVID (as Booth puts a controller back together): Do you know what you're doing?\nBOOTH: Yeah. I can fix anything.\nDAVID: Cool.\nBOOTH: You guys, uh, you guys have girlfriends?\nDAVID: I do.\nSHAWN: Her name's Leila.\nBOOTH: Leila. Leila.\nDAVID: I thought you were gonna ask us questions about Charlie.\nBOOTH: Yeah, so which one of you puny mortals wants to challenge me first?\nSHAWN: Oh, me!\n[They start playing, and Shawn eyes Booth a bit suspiciously.]\n[Cut to: The Jeffersonian, Zack's office.]\nBRENNAN: You about to clean the bones?\nZACK: Yes. I'm warming up the boiler now.\nBRENNAN: Something wrong?\nZACK: These are the smallest remains I've ever worked on.\nBRENNAN: That's a valid observation, Zack, but it's not helpful to the investigation.\nZACK: Sorry, Dr. Brennan.\nBRENNAN: I was at Waco, Branch Davidian compound. I helped identify children who had been killed in the fire. Seventeen of them.\nZACK: So, you're saying I'll get used to it?\nBRENNAN: No, I'm saying you'll never get used to it. We're primates. Social creatures. It's coded into our DNA to protect our young. Even from each other.\nZACK: So, I'm always going to feel terrible?\nBRENNAN: What helps me is to pull back emotionally. Just... put your heart in a box.\nZACK: I am not good with metaphor, Dr. Brennan.\nBRENNAN: Focus on the details.\nZACK: Details. Yeah, I can do that.\n[They walk over to where the bones are laid out on a table.]\nZACK: No trauma to the skull. No compound fractures. Charlie was not beaten to death or dismembered.\nBRENNAN: It helps not to refer to the victim by name.\nZACK: Greenstick fractures on ribs four, five, six, and seven. And the sternum is snapped transversally from the tip to the xiphoid.\nBRENNAN: Okay, what does that indicate?\nZACK: The victim's chest was struck by a heavy, blunt object.\nBRENNAN: Are you completely certain we've learned everything we can from the body at this stage of decomposition?\nZACK: I've been over everything at least three times.\nBRENNAN: Smell the mouth.\n[He does so.]\nBRENNAN: Anything behind the typical smells of decomposition?\nZACK: Some kind of chemical. Chloroform. Something used to render the boy unconscious.\nBRENNAN: Take samples from the mouth, jaw, sinuses, and... what's left of the esophagus. Kids make it harder, Zack.\n[She exits, and he looks down at the body for a moment.]\n[Cut to: Outside the Sanders house, Booth exits with Shawn, David, and Margaret.]\nBOOTH: All right, look, you beat me bad.\nDAVID: No wonder you don't have a girlfriend.\nMARGARET: David!\nBOOTH: It's okay, Mrs. Sanders. It's alright. No, I do have a girlfriend.\nSHAWN: Is she pretty?\nBOOTH: Nah, she's butt ugly. Got a glass eye, snaggly back teeth. So, was Leila with you the day that Charlie disappeared?\nDAVID: Uh, yeah, actually. We stopped and played some video games at the arcade.\nBOOTH: That must've been before you and Charlie went to the park.\nMARGARET: You didn't go to the mall that day, David.\n[She looks at David, who looks away.]\nMARGARET: Shawn?\nDAVID: Don't ask Shawn, mom.\nBOOTH: You met Leila at the mall, didn't you? You left Charlie with Shawn at the park.\nDAVID: Well, just for a few minutes, and then they came back to the mall.\nMARGARET: David!\nDAVID: Shawn let go of his hand for a second, Charlie was gone like that!\n[Across the street, Skyler and his father load up a truck to go off on an extermination job.]\nDAVID: And then we came straight home.\nBOOTH: Charlie wasn't taken from the park, he was snatched from the mall. We've been looking in the wrong place.\nOS: MR. NELSON: Come on, son. Let's go.\n[Cut to: Jeffersonian lab. Hodgins places the victim's jawbone into a plastic box and replaces the lid. Angela approaches.]\nANGELA: What's with the rubber band?\nHODGINS: Methyl oxide vapor in this chamber will bind to whatever compound Charlie breathed in before he was killed.\n[Angela reaches over and snaps the rubber band.]\nHODGINS: Ouch!\nANGELA: It's an anger management technique, right?\nHODGINS: The key there is management, which is what I'm doing. Managing my anger.\n[The box fills with vapor.]\nHODGINS: There'll be a color change. Red for pnictogens and chalcogens, and blue for halogens.\nANGELA: I get that you're a little off-kilter. Mad at the government, conspiracy of dunces, all that. Maybe even furious that you've had to mount a little boy's jawbone inside a box to find out what killed him. What I don't get is why going to a banquet makes you angry.\n[The vapor starts to clear, and the bone glows blue in areas.]\nHODGINS: Halogens it is. I'm gonna scrape off the particles and see if the mass spectrometer can identify what type of halogen.\nANGELA: Anger is only fear, turned inwards.\n[She moves to leave, but stops to snap the rubber band against his wrist one more time. He flinches, and she exits.]\n[Cut to: Angela's office. Brennan, Angela, and Booth are looking at her computer monitor.]\nANGELA: There are twenty surveillance cameras taking stills every two seconds throughout the mall, including access corridors and parking lots. I concentrated on the ones aimed at the public concourse.\nBOOTH: Okay, ten thousand people a day go through that mall. How are we gonna find one small kid?\nBRENNAN: Angela designed a mass recognition program to apply body types to skeletal remains.\nANGELA: Endomorph, ectomorph, mesomorph, that sort of thing. I modified it to scan two dimensional images. In this case, we're looking for body masses roughly congruent with Charlie, Shawn, and David.\n[She points at the screen.]\nANGELA: There's David.\nBOOTH: You're actually one of them.\nANGELA: One of who?\nBOOTH: A squint. I mean, you look normal and you act normal, but you're actually one of them.\nANGELA: This whole mass recognition program was Brennan's idea. I'm completely normal. Really.\nBOOTH: Yeah, maybe before you got this job. But now... BRENNAN (pointing at the screen): I see Charlie.\nBOOTH: Oh. That's him, all right.\nANGELA (whispering): Oh, God.\nBRENNAN: Ange? Are you okay?\nANGELA: It's just... these are probably the last pictures of this little... guy alive. Why is he alone? Why isn't anybody with him? (pause) Sorry. Max resolution is X-40 by 480 pixels per square inch.\nBOOTH: No, wait, he's not alone. Someone's calling him over. Can't you just zoom in?\n[On the screen, we see Charlie walk over to a person, who's obscured by a banner.]\nANGELA: The fewer pixels that make up an image, the more the picture degrades once we zoom in on it. Did that sound too squinty?\nBRENNAN: Any way to enhance it?\nANGELA: Well, I wouldn't bet a date with Colin Farrell on it.\nBRENNAN: I know him. He's funny.\nANGELA: Funny is Will Ferrell, sweetie. Hot is Colin Farrell.\nBOOTH: Now look, wait. The kid was definitely moving toward someone. He wasn't struggling. He wasn't trying to get away. You know, I want to add the neighborhood kid Skyler Nelson to the list of possible suspects.\nANGELA: I have one other angle, but our bad guy is still obstructed in it.\n[They all look at the screen.]\nBOOTH: Who the hell are you?\n[Dissolve to: Jeffersonian hallway. Angela's sitting on a bench. Brennan approaches.]\nBRENNAN: Are you thinking of leaving the Jeffersonian?\nANGELA: I'm not really this person.\n[Brennan sits down.]\nBRENNAN: What person?\nANGELA: I'm not like you. I'm not driven by the need for justice and all that. I'm a good-time girl.\nBRENNAN: We have good times.\nANGELA: Cracking jokes over murdered skeletons is not good times.\nBRENNAN: I know it's harder on you than it is for the rest of us.\nANGELA: No it's not. (pause) Why?\nBRENNAN: Because you look at their faces. We look at everything else. It's more clinical for us. For you - it's personal. When we see a murdered child-\nANGELA: Honey I... I'm, no offense, I'm really not up for one of your 'it takes a village' anthropology lessons. This is the longest I've ever had a job. That's because of you.\nBRENNAN: If this is about hours, or time to do your own art, then-\nANGELA: Just let me work on it, okay? I'm an artist. I used to draw naked guys. Now I draw dead guys.\nBRENNAN: Just don't decide anything without talking to me.\nANGELA: Of course I won't.\n[She leans back and sighs. Brennan leans back as well.]\n[Cut to: Jeffersonian lab. Booth and Brennan walk down the corridor.]\nBRENNAN: I'm afraid Angela might quit.\nBOOTH: I'm amazed she stuck it out this long.\nBRENNAN: Why?\nBOOTH: Oh, because she's human.\n[Brennan gives him look.]\nBOOTH: I'm sorry, Bones, it's just that, you know, uh... Angela didn't get the same training that the rest of you got on, uh, planet Vulcan.\nBRENNAN: I don't know what that means.\n[They enter a room where the skeleton is laid out and Zack is waiting.]\nBOOTH: She's more sensitive.\nZACK: Who's more sensitive?\nBRENNAN: Angela.\nBOOTH: She likes puppies and kitties and ducklings, and, you know, Jell-O shots and, you know, dancing on bars.\n[He makes some music and dances a little.]\nBRENNAN: I know that. She's my best friend. And Angela's not the only person in the world who likes baby animals.\nZACK: I never got the big attraction.\nBOOTH: I rest my case. She's more sensitive.\nZACK: We cross-referenced the length and density of Charlie's leg bones with other children his age. The victim, I mean.\n[Booth stares at the skeleton for a moment, and is obviously emotionally affected by it. Zack notices.]\nZACK: The thing to do is concentrate on the details.\n[There's a pause.]\nBOOTH: Let's do that.\n[He clears his throat.]\nBRENNAN: We found some abnormalities. They're bowed, and abnormally short.\nZACK: Also, the victim's show freezing of the joints at the hip and knee.\nBOOTH: Are you saying Charlie was crippled?\nBRENNAN: The victim was disabled, yes.\nBOOTH: His mother never mentioned that.\nZACK: The ribs are broken in two places, which is not typical of blunt-force trauma.\nBRENNAN: How do you explain that?\nZACK: I'd attribute it to his medical condition and the corresponding brittleness of his bones.\nBRENNAN: I agree. What is that condition?\nZACK: It looks like scoliosis - a bend in the spine.\n[Brennan walks over to the x-rays on the wall.]\nBRENNAN: I think it's more than that, Zack. There are multiple calcified lesions on the posterior thoracic vertebrae. That, plus Charlie's short stature, and the asymmetric length of his legs... Margaret Sanders may not be Charlie's biological mother.\nBOOTH: What?\nBRENNAN (to Zack): Test the bones for X-linked hypophosphatemia and Coffin-Lowry Syndrome.\n[They start to move away, but Booth stops them.]\nBOOTH: Whoa, whoa. Okay, hold on. Simmer down, just back up to the part where she's not his mother.\nZACK: Dr. Brennan is having me check for hereditary genetic defects which are always passed from mother to child.\nBRENNAN: If Charlie had one, then Margaret Sanders is not his mother.\n[Cut to: Interrogation room. Booth and Brennan are questioning Margaret Sanders.]\nMARGARET: How can you say that?\nBRENNAN: Charlie suffered from a hereditary genetic disorder called hypophosphatemia.\nBOOTH: Charlie's real mother would have the same disease.\nBRENNAN: You do not.\nMARGARET: Never say I wasn't Charlie's real mother, because I was.\nBOOTH: Biological mother, then. Mrs. Sanders, you are not Charlie's biological mother. You want to explain that to us?\nMARGARET: I can't have children. That's why my husband left me. So I took in foster kids.\nBRENNAN: Like Shawn and David Cook.\nMARGARET: And Charlie. Though is name was Nathan. I got him as a baby down in Pittsburgh. Ten days old. His mother was arrested on drug charges, and Child Services brought him to me. Three weeks I had him. Then the charges were dropped.\nBOOTH: You kept him?\nMARGARET: No. I gave him back. But it nearly killed me. I stayed in touch. I bought him things - formula, stroller. I wanted to make sure he was all right.\nBOOTH: Nathan what, Mrs. Sanders?\nMARGARET: Nathan Downey. His mother was a drug addict named Janine. Christmas Day I found her dead on her kitchen floor, a needle stuck in her arm. And I could hear Charlie, crying upstairs. So I went up.\nBRENNAN: And you took him home.\nMARGARET: I looked him in the eyes, and I promised him I would never leave him alone again. And he stopped crying. I expected every day for Child Services to come looking.\nBRENNAN: He would've ended up back in the system anyway.\nMARGARET (breaking down, crying): I meant to keep him safe... and love him. And now he's dead.\n[Cut to: Booth's office. Booth enters, Brennan right behind.]\nBOOTH: I had to arrest her.\nBRENNAN: The story checked out. The overdose.\nBOOTH: She confessed to kidnapping.\nBRENNAN: Margaret Sanders did nothing more than respond to the anthropological imperative. She saw an orphan, and reacted.\nBOOTH: This is not a National Geographic study, okay? This is the suburbs.\nBRENNAN: Why would she kill the boy? She obviously loved him.\nBOOTH: There are situations, right? The kid gets sick, he doesn't turn out to be what you wanted. I bet that you could give me a dozen examples of societies that have killed their own young.\nBRENNAN: What about Shawn and David Cook? Where do they go now?\nBOOTH: Back into the system.\nBRENNAN: Do you have any idea how bad the foster care system is?\nBOOTH: Do you? What do you want to do, hmm? Do you want to kidnap them, the way that she kidnapped Charlie?\nBRENNAN: I want you to let them go home to Margaret Sanders.\nBOOTH: It's not gonna happen.\n[Brennan leaves.]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Cut to: Angela's office. Angela and Zack are bent over the computer.]\nZACK: Try redigitizing and resizing.\nANGELA: I did. The extrapolation protocol got confused by the spread. Hey, you know Hodgins better than anybody else. So why is he so bent out of shape about this banquet?\nZACK: What makes you say that?\nANGELA: Because every time someone mentions it, he starts snapping that rubber band around his wrist.\nZACK: I mean, what makes you think I know Hodgins better than anyone else?\nANGELA: You're roommates.\nZACK: I live above his garage.\nANGELA: But you see a lot of each other.\nZACK: Not really.\nANGELA: He drives you to work.\nZACK: I've never been up to the main house.\nANGELA: The main house?\nZACK: It's at the opposite end of the driveway on the other side of the tennis courts across from pond.\n[Booth enters.]\nBOOTH: Okay, anything on the identity of Charlie's abductor?\nANGELA: I can't clear up this image any more than it is. Tell Booth what you told me about living in Hodgins' garage.\nZACK: There's a bedroom, living room, kitchen, another bedroom, a den, two bathrooms-\nBOOTH: Great. Quite a garage. Can we focus on the case?\nANGELA: How many cars does he have in that garage?\nZACK: Including the antique ones, about twelve. And a boat.\nANGELA: Zack has never seen the main house because the tennis courts and the pond block the view.\nBOOTH: Well, he must be one of those Hodgins.\nZACK: Who are 'those' Hodginses?\nBOOTH: You know, the Cantilever Group Hodgins?\nANGELA: Oh my God.\nZACK: The same Cantilever Group that generates more G.N.P. than Europe?\nANGELA: Get this. They are the single biggest donors to the Jeffersonian Institution.\n[Booth laughs.]\nBOOTH: That makes Hodgins your boss.\nANGELA: What do you guys even talk about when he drives you to work?\nZACK: I mostly sleep. Hodgins mostly yells at the radio.\n[On the computer screen, the abductor leads the child out of a glass door.]\nBOOTH: Okay, if you can't see the guy's face, maybe you can grab a reflection.\nZACK: That's a workable idea.\nBOOTH: Well, I'd say thanks, you know, if you didn't say it like it was some kind of a miracle.\n[Cut to: Brennan's office. She's typing, looking very determined.\n[Hodgins enters.]\nHODGINS: Chem lab mass spectrometer identifies the particulates in Charlie Sanders' mouth as fluoride.\n[He looks at Brennan.]\nHODGINS: I recognize that look.\nBRENNAN: What?\n[He looks at the rolling board of notes.]\nHODGINS: You're writing another book. When you write, you get this stunned look on your face like you stuck a fork in a toaster. Am I in this one too?\nBRENNAN: You weren't in the last one. Fluoride? At what concentration?\nHODGINS: It's too high for toothpaste.\nBRENNAN: Put together a list of -\n[She sees he's not listening and reading the notes. She pushes the board away from him a little.]\nBRENNAN: Put together a list of anything that could conceivably contain fluoride at those levels.\nHODGINS: All right. Do you have time for this?\nBRENNAN: They gave me a car.\nHODGINS: Nice. Who?\nBRENNAN: My publisher. Now I feel like I have to earn it by writing another book.\nHODGINS: Fight coercion in all its forms. You don't write the book, I don't go to the banquet. Solidarity.\n[He leaves, Booth enters.]\nBOOTH: Angela has a face for the abductor.\n[She exits quickly. Booth sneaks a peek at the board of notes before following.]\n[Cut to: Angela's office. Booth, Brennan, and Angela are crowded around the computer.]\nANGELA: I looked on both cameras. This one offered up more reflective surfaces.\nBOOTH: Right at the door.\nANGELA: Check this out.\nBOOTH: The abductor's face.\nANGELA: By polarizing the image, the computer can interpret the spaces between the white and the dark gaps and fill in the missing pieces.\nBOOTH: Wait. That doesn't look like an adult.\nANGELA: When I repolarize the image...\n[The blurry picture becomes clear.]\nBOOTH: Shawn Cook.\nBRENNAN: The victim's foster brother.\n[Cut to: Interrogation room. Shawn Cook draws pictures in some spilled water on the table. Booth is questioning him as a child advocate sits nearby. Brennan and a juvenile prosecutor watch from outside.]\nBOOTH: Where were you taking Charlie, Shawn?\nSHAWN: I brought him to the mall to see David.\nBOOTH: I know you brought him to the mall. But we got a picture of you... leading him out of the mall.\n[He slides a printed image of the picture from Angela's computer screen in front of Shawn.]\nBRENNAN: Have you seen much of this kind of thing?\nPROSECUTOR: I'm a juvenile prosecutor. I wish I could say kids killing kids was rare.\nBOOTH: Where were you taking him, Shawn?\nSHAWN: When can I talk to Margaret?\nBOOTH: After you answer my questions.\nBRENNAN: Can he do that? Lie to a kid?\nPROSECUTOR: We're after a child killer, Dr. Brennan. If the child advocate in there doesn't complain, I sure as hell won't.\nBRENNAN: Well, what's the point of having a child advocate if he doesn't advocate for the child?\nPROSECUTOR: I get the impression that you're a little confused as to what side you're on, Dr. Brennan.\nBOOTH (lifting the hem of his shirt): Shawn, you know what that is?\nSHAWN: A scar?\n[Booth tucks his shirt back in.]\nBOOTH: Yeah. Got it when I was playing soldier with my brother Jared.\nSHAWN: Did it hurt?\nBOOTH: Yeah, it hurt. But it was an accident. You got any scars?\n[Shawn rolls up his sleeve show a few small, round marks on his arm.]\nSHAWN: My dad did it with a cigarette.\nBOOTH: He shouldn't have done that.\n[Shawn slides his sleeve back down.]\nSHAWN: Margaret didn't do anything like that. I love Margaret.\nBOOTH: What I need to know is if Charlie had some kind of an accident.\n[Shawn doesn't answer.]\nBOOTH: Shawn?\nADVOCATE: Maybe we can just take a break.\nBOOTH: Shawn?\nPROSECUTOR: He's not being aggressive enough.\nBRENNAN: Foster kids are powerless. They're treated like garbage. You're in a position to do something about it, and all you have to say is 'He's not being aggressive enough'?\nPROSECUTOR: Dr. Brennan, you know this boy may very well have beaten a child to death with a rock?\n[The prosecutor exits.]\n[Cut to: Lab platform. Hodgins is working, and Angela walks up to him.]\nANGELA: How long have we known each other?\nHODGINS: Do people really ever know each other?\nANGELA: How come you never invited me over to your house?\nHODGINS: Oh, I didn't pick up that kind of vibe off you.\nANGELA: I thought we were close. All of us. What else don't I know? Is Zack from another planet?\nHODGINS: Oh, come on. That one's obvious.\nANGELA: You're rich. You single-handedly own the Cantilever Group. Don't deny, I know.\nHODGINS: Who else knows?\nANGELA: Zack, Booth.\nHODGINS: Don't tell Brennan.\nANGELA: Why don't you want us to know that you're actually our boss?\nHODGINS (harshly): I don't want to be anybody's boss. I never did. Please respect that.\n[Angela leaves, and Brennan enters.]\nBRENNAN: What's up with Angela?\nHODGINS: It's... job pressure.\n[There's a pause.]\nHODGINS: Fluoride at lower concentrations is used in toothpaste, instant tea, and is added to our drinking water. Which, I might add, can cause a range of conditions, brain damage-\nBRENNAN: Which has nothing to do with the case at hand.\n[Hodgins pauses a moment before continuing.]\nHODGINS: The concentrations found on our victim might come from wood preservatives, paint thinners, car wax, or various other industrial products.\n[He hands Brennan a list, and she stick it on her clipboard.]\nBRENNAN: Okay. Did Angela say anything about quitting her job?\nHODGINS: No. But we hardly know anything about each other.\n[Brennan exits.]\n[Cut to: The room where the skeleton is laid out. Brennan is writing notes as Booth enters.]\nBOOTH: Bones, I thought you'd like to know that Shawn and David are in emergency care. Pulled some strings, you know, to make sure they- they get to stay together.\nBRENNAN: That's good, thanks.\nBOOTH: It's the best I could do.\nBRENNAN: Yeah, I understand.\nBOOTH: No, you say you understand, but you don't. Not really. I mean, if you don't like the rule, you ignore it, right?\n[He steps forward and leans on the table.]\nBOOTH: I can't have that. And if you want to do this-\nBRENNAN: Do what?\nBOOTH: Work on cases, you know, with me. Outside the lab. If you wanna do that, I need to know that you will respect the law.\nBRENNAN (voice breaking): Tell you what, if I can't respect the law, I can at least respect you.\nBOOTH (a little surprised): Well- Yeah, that'll work, too. I mean it kind of comes out of nowhere, but-\n[Brennan notices the pencil he broke when he leaned on the table. It now sits in three pieces.]\nBRENNAN: Look what you did.\nBOOTH: It's a pencil. I'll get you a new one.\nBRENNAN: The victim was killed by trauma to the chest, but the ribs are broken in two places, not just one.\nBOOTH: Uh, because of the, uh, brittle bones. Because of his disease.\nBRENNAN: Well, that was my assumption, but there's another explanation.\n[She moves to leave, but he blocks her.]\nBOOTH: Yeah, whoa. What's the other explanation?\nBRENNAN: Compression.\n[She leaves, and he follows.]\nBOOTH: Like Charlie Sanders was crushed to death?\nBRENNAN: Yes. Greenstick fractures. Vertebral and sternal.\n[She holds up the broken pencil.]\nBRENNAN: See?\nBOOTH: Hey, Shawn Cook outweighed Charlie Sanders by, what, thirty pounds? How could he have crushed him to death?\n[They come across Angela as they enter the lab.]\nBRENNAN: Angela, we need to run some scenarios through the Angelator.\n[She walks off, and Booth and Angela move to follow. Hodgins enters from behind.]\nHODGINS: Angela, Booth!\n[They stop.]\nHODGINS: Zack has been informed that if he tells anyone who I am, I will kick him out on the street like a stray dog. Sadly, there is nothing I can threaten you two with.\nANGELA: Yeah, that's a shame.\nHODGINS: What I want out of my life is to come in here and sift through slime and bugs. Unfortunately, my family is one of those who secretly run the world.\nBOOTH: Paranoia and delusions of grandeur all in one package.\n[Booth and Angela start to walk away.]\nHODGINS: You call it paranoia, I call it the family business. Please could you just stop!\n[They do, and turn back.]\nHODGINS: The reason that I do not want to go to that banquet is that the other members of the ruling elite will make a big fuss about seeing me. My secret will be out and my life, this life that I love, will be ruined. I'm asking you, please, please just let me be Jack Hodgins who works in the lab.\n[He exits.]\n[Cut to: Angela's office. Brennan, Booth, and Angela are around the Angelator where an image of Charlie Sanders is showing.]\nANGELA: Charlie was three feet, four inches tall and weighed fifty-eight pounds.\nBRENNAN: And Shawn?\nANGELA: Shawn Cook is 1.4 meters tall and weighs 31 kilograms.\nBOOTH: His brother David was 5'8\", 150 pounds.\nANGELA: 1.75 meters, 68 kilograms.\nBRENNAN: At first, I thought the break to Charlie's sternum was caused by blunt trauma because it only ran along one fault line. But when Booth broke my pencil, I realized there's another way to cause the same type of injury. Compression.\nANGELA: Hodgins found no particulates that suggested crushing.\nBRENNAN: Body weight. There has to be enough weight on the victim to stop the abdomen from moving so no air can get into the lungs.\n[On the Angelator, a pair of legs appears on top of Charlie's horizontal form, and the bones of both people are shown through their bodies.]\nBRENNAN: Prolonged pressure caused the sternum to snap in half and the ribs to break.\n[On the Angelator, the pressure of the body on top of Charlie causes the ribs to snap. Angela is obviously emotionally affected by this visual and turns away slightly. Brennan looks over at her.]\nANGELA: Sorry, sorry. I entered real-world variables, taking into account Charlie's size and the amount of pressure...\n[The visual runs through again, and Angela pauses for a short moment.]\nANGELA: ...that was required to break Charlie's sternum in the way that it was broken.\nBOOTH: What did you end up with?\nANGELA: 86.2 kilograms.\nBOOTH: What's that in American?\nBRENNAN: 190 pounds.\nBOOTH: Yeah.\nANGELA: Way too much for either of the Cook kids or Margaret Sanders.\nBOOTH: I'd put the neighborhood kid Skyler at about 160 pounds.\nBRENNAN: It can't be him either.\nBOOTH: We should be looking for a full-grown man.\nBRENNAN: You have to get Shawn to tell you where he took Charlie when they left the mall.\nBOOTH: He won't talk to me.\nBRENNAN: Let me do it.\nBOOTH: Uh, no. You know, people are not your strong point, Bones. And besides, he's not going to care how many facts you put in front of him.\nBRENNAN: Could you just go with me on this one, Booth? We're trying to catch a killer. Let me help.\nBOOTH: When's the last time you even talked to a kid?\nBRENNAN: I know what to say.\n[Cut to: The interrogation room. Booth and the juvenile prosecutor from before are watching from outside as Brennan talks to Shawn as the child advocate observes.]\nBRENNAN: Do you remember me, Shawn?\nSHAWN: The museum lady. The one who's so smart.\nBRENNAN: Yeah, I'm pretty smart.\nPROSECUTOR: And very modest.\nBOOTH: Oh, believe me, she is being modest.\nBRENNAN: Smart enough to know that you didn't kill Charlie. You don't have to say anything, Shawn. Just listen. They give you a garbage bag to carry all your stuff, like they're telling you everything you own is garbage. And then you have to go to a new school in clothes that smell like garbage bags.\nSHAWN: All the regular kids know you're a foster kid. How do you know what it's like?\nBRENNAN: They bounce you from place to place, and it's never home. Sometimes the foster parents are nice.\nSHAWN: Like Margaret?\nBRENNAN: Yeah. And sometimes they separate you from your brother. It must have been nice with Margaret, staying with David.\nSHAWN (starting to cry): We got bunk beds. At night, I knew David was there. Like he was guarding me. Margaret's nice.\nBRENNAN: You'd do almost anything to stay with Margaret, right?\n[Shawn nods.]\nBRENNAN: The man you took Charlie to, the man who hurt him, he knows that. You didn't know that he'd hurt Charlie, but he did. And then he told you that Margaret would blame you, that she'd hate you. But this man is lying to you, Shawn. I can make sure that you go back to Margaret.\nSHAWN: How? You work at a museum.\nBRENNAN (looking pointedly through the one-way mirror at Booth): I have a friend at the FBI. If I ask him to, he will make sure that you and David get to live with Margaret again.\nADVOCATE: Dr. Brennan, you can't make promises like that.\nBRENNAN: Yes, I can. He will do it. My friend will make it happen.\nBOOTH: Oh, man.\nBRENNAN: But you have to tell me who hurt Charlie.\nBOOTH: I'm gonna need your help to keep the promises she made to that boy.\nPROSECUTOR: Hey, I- I can't promise-\nBOOTH: Mrs. Johnson, my people and your people are gonna have to make this happen.\nSHAWN: What if Margaret doesn't want me anymore? Charlie was her real son.\nBRENNAN: Charlie wasn't her biological son either. Charlie was just like you: someone that Margaret chose to love. I don't think we should let that man take you and David and Charlie away from Margaret, do you?\n[Shawn shakes his head.]\nBRENNAN: We should stop him. You and I should stop him.\n[Shawn sits in silence, crying for a moment, before wrapping Brennan in a hug. He whispers something into her ear.]\nBOOTH: She did it. She got his name.\n[Cut to: The street outside the Sanders house. Booth pulls up as Skyler and his father are loading up their vehicle to go off on a job. Starsailor's 'Some of Us' plays in the background as Booth arrests Mr. Nelson.]\nBOOTH: Edward Nelson, you are under arrest for the sexual assault and murder of Charlie Sanders. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you free of charge...\n[Cut to: Angela's office, the song still playing. She sets the missing poster and her sketch of Charlie side-by-side, and sighs.]\n[Cut to: Lab platform. The song continues as Hodgins takes the jaw bone he had tested and puts it on a tray Zack holds. He looks away as Zack exits.]\n[Cut to: The Sanders house, music still playing. Booth leads Edward Nelson to the FBI vehicle in handcuffs as Brennan watching Mrs. Nelson talk to her son. Both Booth and Brennan watching as Skyler hugs his crying mother. Their eyes meet before Booth exits.]\n[Cut to: The Jeffersonian. Zack, with a shaking hand, places the jawbone in a coffin with the rest of Charlie's skeleton and shuts the lid. Two men in suits somberly take the casket out of the room as Zack watches, emotional.]\n[Cut to: FBI building. Booth enters with Margaret Sanders.]\nMARGARET: Boys.\n[David and Shawn rush up and hug her.]\nDAVID and SHAWN: Mom!\n[Booth and Brennan lock eyes over the hugging family.]\nOS: SHAWN: Are we gonna be a family again?\nOS: MARGARET: Oh, you betcha.\n[Cut to: Brennan's office. The song fades out. Booth enters.]\nBOOTH: We have him cold. The insecticide he was using on the termites matches the fluoride concentration perfectly. Skyler's dad admitted everything.\nBRENNAN: Don't tell me, he said crushing Charlie to death was a mistake.\nBOOTH: He never abused Shawn Cook, he just used him to get near Charlie. It played out just like you said. He had Charlie out in that field. Some teenage kids, they come by, so he knelt on Charlie to keep him from crying out. Shawn got scared and ran back to his brother.\nBRENNAN: Charlie was small and weak. His sternum collapsed. You think he abused any other kids.\nBOOTH: Yeah, probably his own son.\nBRENNAN: You report that to Child Services?\nBOOTH: Mm-hmm. Try to get the kid some help.\n[He pauses.]\nBOOTH: Look, I'm sorry.\nBRENNAN: For what?\nBOOTH: You have personal experience in the system.\n[Brennan pauses for a moment.]\nBRENNAN: I was a foster child until my grandfather got me out.\nBOOTH: Yeah, when you said 'They take you away from your brother,' I kind of had the feeling you weren't talking about David Cook.\nBRENNAN: Booth, I'll tell you all about it one day, but tonight I have to get dressed for a party.\nBOOTH: Oh. Okay, Bones.\n[He moves to leave.]\nBRENNAN: By the way, there's a huge ding in my passenger-side door because you told me not to park it at an angle.\nBOOTH (laughing): What?\nBRENNAN: Okay, that's just mean. You're mean.\nBOOTH (still laughing as he exits): Sorry.\n[Cut to: Lab. Goodman enters, where Angela, Zack, and Hodgins are already standing. With the exception of the latter, they are all dressed in formal attire.]\nGOODMAN: That is not a tuxedo, Dr. Hodgins.\nHODGINS: I am not going, Dr. Goodman.\nGOODMAN: You are going.\n[He sticks a nametag in Hodgins' lab coat pocket.]\nGOODMAN: When we arrive, the donor's will all be wearing nametags.\n[He hands a nametag to Zack.]\nZACK: What do we talk about?\nGOODMAN: Your work, of course.\n[He moves to Angela.]\nANGELA: Zack's work consists of removing flesh from corpses. Hodgins dissects bugs that have been eating people's eyeballs.\nHODGINS: Leave me out of it. I'm not going.\nGOODMAN: And how do you see your job?\nANGELA: I draw death masks.\nGOODMAN: Is that really how you see it?\nANGELA: Don't you?\nGOODMAN: You are the best of us, Miss Montenegro. You discern humanity in the wreck of a ruined human body. You give victims back their faces, their identities. You remind us all of why we're here in the first place. Because we treasure human life.\n[She pauses for a moment before stepping forward and wrapping Dr. Goodman in a hug.]\nGOODMAN: Oh, for God's sake.\n[Brennan enters in a formal dress.]\nBRENNAN: What happened?\nZACK: Apparently all Angela needed was to hear her job description in a deep, African-American tone.\nGOODMAN (scolding): Mr. Addy.\n[Booth enters.]\nBOOTH: Dr. Goodman, we need Hodgins in the lab tonight.\n[He hands an evidence bag of dirt to Hodgins.]\nBOOTH: FBI needs this analyzed by morning.\nHODGINS: Uh, I'll get right on it.\nGOODMAN: Wait a minute, what case file is this?\nBRENNAN: Am I supposed to know about it?\nANGELA: Booth mentioned it to me earlier today.\nBRENNAN: That's good enough for me.\nGOODMAN (conceding): Fine. You're off the hook, Dr. Hodgins. Let's not keep the limo waiting.\n[He leaves, and Angela and Zack exit with him.]\nHODGINS (to Booth): Thanks.\n[Hodgins exits as well, and Starsailor's 'Some of Us' starts playing again.]\nBOOTH: You look nice. Better than nice, you look, uh... very... BRENNAN: Thanks.\nBOOTH: Bones, how did you know I was gonna keep your promise?\nBRENNAN: What promise?\nBOOTH: To get Shawn and David back with Margaret Sanders.\nBRENNAN: Maybe I was lying. To catch the bad guy. I learned that trick from you. The end justifies the means.\n[Booth moves to leave.]\nBRENNAN: Booth.\n[He stops, turns back.]\nBRENNAN: I knew you'd back me up. I knew you wouldn't make me a liar.\nBOOTH: Hmm. How did you know?\nBRENNAN: Because you want to go to heaven.\nBOOTH: But you don't believe in heaven.\nBRENNAN: But you do.\n[They smile at each other, and part ways.]\n[Fade to black.]\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Keep him covered.\nKARI: My power pack's dead.\nDOCTOR: Come on.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Let me have your radio.\nKARI: It's always the same pattern.\nDOCTOR: Well, at least the level's acceptable, for the time being. Come on.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNYSSA: Are you in charge?\nEIRAK: Be quiet.\nNYSSA: Please listen.\nEIRAK: Shut the door.\nINGA: You'll get nothing out of them. They're not interested.\nNYSSA: I've got to make them understand.\nINGA: You can't even bribe them. The only thing they care about is Hydromel, the drug that keeps them alive.\nNYSSA: What are they going to do with us?\nINGA: Supposedly cure us, but I rather think they're going to let us die.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSIGURD: Lazar assessment from tank three, Eirak.\nEIRAK: Coloured water. They must think we're fools. They've even reduced the size of the consignment.\nSIGURD: Why the cutback?\nEIRAK: Maybe our performance is down.\nSIGURD: But we process everyone who comes here. Why doesn't the Company send someone to see the conditions we work under?\nEIRAK: Maybe they already have. We are slaves. The Company doesn't need to tell us anything.\nVALGARD: Intruders. I saw two people down in the stockyard, a man and a girl. They went into the Forbidden Zone.\nEIRAK: Lazars?\nVALGARD: No. No, they were too fit. And they were armed.\nSIGURD: Agents from the Company.\nEIRAK: Why didn't you stop them?\nVALGARD: I tried.\nSIGURD: Why are they in the Forbidden Zone?\nEIRAK: The perfect place to hide. We never go there. As the Company has decided to cut back our supply of Hydromel, it is in our own interest to learn why. If the couple in the Forbidden Zone are from the Company, their knowledge is vital.\nVALGARD: How do we find them?\nEIRAK: Someone must go after them.\nVALGARD: Why don't you? You're supposed to be our honoured leader.\nEIRAK: I'm needed here.\nVALGARD: So you keep telling us, although I sometimes wonder whether we need you at all.\nSIGURD: Valgard!\nEIRAK: You think you could be better?\nVALGARD: Yes.\nEIRAK: All right, I'll make you an offer. Bring back the spies and I'll step down in your favour.\nVALGARD: I have your word on that?\nEIRAK: You have the Vanir as your witness. Think of it as a bet. If you're ambitious enough, you'll accept it.\nVALGARD: All right, agreed.\nEIRAK: Then go!\nSIGURD: He'll die in the Forbidden Zone.\nEIRAK: He hates me. He'll succeed.\nSIGURD: And you will give him what you say?\nEIRAK: Of course.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINGA: There's no way out, just as there's no cure. It's hopeless.\nNYSSA: Tell me about the Forbidden Zone.\nINGA: You don't give up, do you.\nNYSSA: Tell me.\nINGA: I only know what I've heard. It's where the radiation's too strong for them, and where we're supposed to be cured.\nNYSSA: And what's the Garm?\nINGA: You'll find out soon enough.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSIGURD: They're starting to move the Lazars. Tank three.\nOLVIR: I'll be down in a moment.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSIGURD: I've just come from the equipment store. I think we have a third intruder.\nEIRAK: Excellent. Carry on with those.\nEIRAK: It seems Valgard's mission was unnecessary after all. Come on, we'll apprehend this one ourselves.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Why do the crew put up with such a radiation leak?\nKARI: It could be part of the cure.\nDOCTOR: Olvir said there wasn't one. So, why don't they repair it?\nKARI: They may not know how to.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Radiation. Fallout. Now that's a thought.\nKARI: What?\nDOCTOR: Nothing. Just an idea worth pursuing.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEIRAK: You. Turn around.\nEIRAK: You fool.\nSIGURD: But it spoke.\nEIRAK: Perhaps you're developing the Lazar disease.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nVALGARD: I'm going.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEIRAK: It's hardly touched. Take her first, then.\nSIGURD: You.\nNYSSA: No. No, wait. Others are worse than me.\nEIRAK: The fit ones go first. Take her.\nNYSSA: No. No, please. No.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: What is it?\nKARI: I can hear someone singing.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: Tegan.\nTEGAN: What?\nTURLOUGH: If ever you had to kill someone, could you do it? Could you?\nTEGAN: No. I don't know. If it was important, to save my friend, to defend myself.\nTURLOUGH: But cold-bloodedly?\nTEGAN: You're weird, Turlough. What a subject to bring up at a time like this. Come on, let's find the control room.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): You are a fool, boy.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKARI: Who is it?\nDOCTOR: Well, he seems happy enough. Let's find out.\nKARI: No.\nDOCTOR: He's hurt. Hello, I'm the Doctor. Can I help?\nBOR: Most kind. Yes. A burden is a, er, something or other. Most kind. Thanks. This way.\nBOR: The cold ground. Rest in peace.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: Curious. What do you make of this?\nTEGAN: It's a map. Like one of those diagrams when they thought the Earth was at the centre of the universe.\nTURLOUGH: Hmm. Strange, isn't it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Terminus entrance. At least we know where the radiation comes from.\nDOCTOR: Look at the damage. Easy now.\nBOR: Thank you. Most kind. Most kind. My name is, er, Bor. I. Haven't we met somewhere before?\nDOCTOR: Indeed. I'm the Doctor.\nBOR: Short term memory's the first to go.\nKARI: He needs a medic.\nBOR: Do you know anything about engines?\nDOCTOR: A little.\nBOR: I tried to pull down the control cables. I picked the wrong ones. Power lines. As I couldn't stop the radiation, I had to try and wall it in. Now things are even worse.\nDOCTOR: In what way?\nBOR: The whole lot's unstable. Know what would happen if one of those exploded? It'd be more than just a loud bang.\nDOCTOR: Chain reaction.\nBOR: Nothing in the universe would be safe.\nKARI: What?\nBOR: Did I tell you? One of the engines has already exploded.\nDOCTOR: When?\nBOR: No, oh, it was a long time ago. It's all in the computer. That one will go next. I didn't find out why until I followed the control cables.\nKARI: Why wasn't Terminus destroyed in the explosion?\nBOR: Terminus is protected.\nVALGARD: Tell them nothing, Bor. They're Company spies.\nBOR: Really? They seemed so friendly.\nVALGARD: You forget our last encounter. The power pack is exhausted. I'm taking you back, but not before I've beaten some respect into you.\nBOR: My wall!\nKARI: Doctor!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNYSSA: Let me go. Please, please, let me go.\nSIGURD: Don't you want to be cured? This is for your own good.\nNYSSA: Please, let me go.\nSIGURD: At least, that's what I'm told.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKARI: What's that?\nDOCTOR: Some sort of signal.\nDOCTOR: Come on.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNYSSA: No! What is that thing?\nSIGURD: Your cure. The Garm's found Bor.\nBOR: Most kind.\nSIGURD: Let's get him to Eirak while he can still talk.\nOLVIR: Let's see that chain.\nNYSSA: No!\nOLVIR: It's me, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Quickly! Quick.\nOLVIR: I can't, I'm not strong enough.\nNYSSA: Olvir!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKARI: What are you looking for now?\nDOCTOR: The control lines. The ones Bor said he followed.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: There must be a way to recreate the door we entered this ship by. Wait here.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKARI: This is a complete waste of time. Bor doesn't know what he's talking about. He's suffering from radiation sickness.\nDOCTOR: Yes, you're right about the sickness. I want to find out what he discovered.\nKARI: Does it matter?\nDOCTOR: I think it could be rather important.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSIGURD: Bor, can you hear me?\nBOR: Sigurd?\nSIGURD: Why did you do it? You knew you couldn't survive in the Forbidden Zone.\nBOR: Worth a try. The pilot's dead, you know.\nSIGURD: Pilot?\nBOR: Of Terminus.\nSIGURD: What?\nBOR: But he's still there. He's going to fire up the engines again and they won't take it and the big bang will happen all over again.\nEIRAK: Where's his helmet?\nSIGURD: He didn't have it. He's delirious. He needs Hydromel.\nEIRAK: There isn't any to spare.\nSIGURD: But he's dying.\nEIRAK: So why detain him?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): You have not destroyed the Doctor.\nTURLOUGH: I haven't found him yet.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): Kill the Doctor.\nTURLOUGH: I will, I will. I have a plan.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): You have nothing.\nTURLOUGH: I do! But I need to get back to the TARDIS.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): Why?\nTURLOUGH: Trust me.\nTEGAN (OOV.): Turlough!\nTURLOUGH: How do I recreate the door?\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): Fail me again\nTURLOUGH: I won't, I promise.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): Then search for an emergency bypass switch.\nTURLOUGH: Where?\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): You have skills. Use them. Look beneath your feet.\nTEGAN: What are you doing?\nTURLOUGH: Remember when we were underneath the floor? Well, I noticed something familiar. It's only just come to me what it was. Come on.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Terminus control.\nKARI: Look.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNYSSA: Olvir!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Do you remember Bor saying one of the engines had exploded?\nKARI: Did he?\nDOCTOR: He was wrong. It didn't come to that. Look at this. Terminus was once capable of time travel.\nKARI: So?\nDOCTOR: Well, to push a ship of this size through time would require an enormous amount of energy.\nKARI: What are you getting at?\nDOCTOR: Well, think about what we've learnt. Terminus seems to be at the centre of the universe, yes? Now, imagine this ship in flight. Suddenly the pilot finds he has an enormous amount of unstable fuel on board. What would you do?\nKARI: Jettison it.\nDOCTOR: Perfectly normal procedure. Unfortunately, he ejects his fuel into a void.\nKARI: And it exploded.\nDOCTOR: Starting a chain reaction.\nKARI: How big?\nDOCTOR: Enormous. Biggest explosion of all time. Event One.\nKARI: The Big Bang?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nKARI: It isn't possible.\nDOCTOR: A chemical reaction in a primeval swamp can create life on a planet. Why couldn't the universe be created by a similar chance factor, hmm?\nKARI: But exploding fuel in space? It's almost too simple.\nDOCTOR: It only appears simple because the circumstances were exactly right.\nKARI: Well, if what you're saying is right, why wasn't Terminus destroyed in the explosion?\nDOCTOR: Well, the pilot time-jumped the ship forward before realising how unstable the fuel was. The resulting shockwave must have caught up with him, boosting the ship billions of years into the future.\nKARI: Killing the pilot and damaging the second engine.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nKARI: If there was a second explosion, would it have the same effect as the jettisoned fuel?\nDOCTOR: Not quite. Whereas the first explosion created the universe, the second would undoubtedly destroy it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: There it is. Emergency bypass. We'll soon have that door open.\nTEGAN: Where's the light coming from?\nTURLOUGH: It's nothing.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKARI: What's happening?\nDOCTOR: I don't know. Oh, no.\nKARI: What?\nDOCTOR: It wasn't the pilot's decision. The computer's just started an automatic sequence to jettison the unstable fuel. If we don't do something quickly, the whole universe will be destroyed.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The Doctor and his companions are trapped in a time-traveling ship called Terminus, which is on the verge of exploding due to an unstable fuel supply. The Doctor realizes that the ship's pilot had jettisoned the fuel into space, which caused a massive explosion that created the universe. However, the pilot had not realized the fuel was unstable, and the ship's computer had started an automatic sequence to jettison the fuel again. If the fuel is not jettisoned, the universe will be destroyed. The Doctor and his companions must find a way to stop the sequence before it is too late.</s>package com.example.android.miwok;"

The glass walls and windows of the Towers reflect the fluffy white clouds hanging in the sky.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n2. INT. THE BASEMENT\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The Cleaner pushes the Chief Caretaker towards his \"pet\" represented by the neon lights through the \"No Entry\" door.)\nVOICE: You have no choice. I am Kroagnon, the Great Architect, and I will put an end to you and everyone in Paradise Towers.\n(The Chief is pushed forward by the Cleaner and into a machine. An opaque cylinder begins to descend on him and obscures him from view. As it does so, he lets out a loud scream. The Doctor and the Kangs come out from their hiding place and watch this happen.)\nBIN LINER: Ware Cleaners!\nTHE DOCTOR: Back to the lift.\n(Fire Escape is hesitant, thinking she can use her weapon on a Kang, but the Doctor gestures for them to run.)\nFIRE ESCAPE: Wait, Doctor.\nTHE DOCTOR: Back!\n(Fire Escape fires her weapon, hitting a Cleaner, but it has no effect on it. Taken off guard, another Cleaner appears. With its claw it grabs the Doctor by the throat and proceeds to strangle him.)\nDRINKING FOUNTAIN: Doctor! Now.\n(She fires her weapon and the arrow hits the Cleaner, causing a malfunction, and thus it loses its grip on the Doctor. The Doctor and the Kangs quickly run for the exit door and it closes, placing a barrier between them and the Cleaners. Back in Kroagnon's lair, the large opaque cylinder rises, revealing what used to be the Chief Caretaker. His skin now has a silvery sheen and his clothing looks clean and shiny. Kroagnon now inhabits the Chief's body. He steps out from the machinery and moves to address the Cleaners who gather around him.)\nKROAGNON: Attention all Robotic Cleaners. Attention all Robotic Cleaners. At last Kroagnon can leave the basement prison they trapped his bodiless brain in and return in this borrowed body to the corridors and lifts of his own creation. They buried me away because I wanted to stop them using the Towers. And now you and I will destroy them.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n3. INT. THE STREET\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The Doctor and the mixture of Kangs race down the street. The Doctor is clearly out of breath lagging behind.)\nTHE DOCTOR: Just a moment, please stop! Please! The immediate danger's over. And I wouldn't mind getting my breath back.\n(The Doctor sits down on an old crate at the side of the corridor. The three Kangs - Drinking Fountain (Blue Kang Leader), Fire Escape (Red Kang Leader) and Bin Liner (Red Kang) - kneel down beside him. A fourth Red Kang stands guard at the end of the corridor.)\nDRINKING FOUNTAIN: The Doctor really is ice hot.\nTHE DOCTOR: Very hot!\nDRINKING FOUNTAIN: Not a yawny Oldster.\nTHE DOCTOR: Now, you understand the dangerous position we're in. We must gather all the Kangs together.\nFIRE ESCAPE: And is the Chief Caretaker really unalive?\nTHE DOCTOR: As himself, yes. But you saw what happened. Up till now Kroagnon's simply been a mind without a body, as your parents must have left him. However, I fear he may have spent his time down there devising a way of performing Corpoelectroscopy - a way of transplanting his brilliant brain to some host body.\nBIN LINER: And what's the come out, Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, I can't be certain. But Kroagnon won't want to stay locked up in his basement much longer. He's bound to show himself in one form or another.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n4. EXT. FLOOR 304 / THE POOL\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Pex is sitting at the side of the pool whilst Mel bobs around in the water, enjoying herself.)\nMEL: Oh, the water's really lovely. You really ought to come and join me, Pex. It'll do you the world of good. There's really nothing to be frightened of.\n(Mel fails to see the Yellow Robotic Crab-like Pool Cleaner as it comes up behind her. It grabs hold of her and she lets out a scream. Pex is alerted and jumps to his feet, uncertain of what to do.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n5. INT. RED KANG HEADQUARTERS\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The hideout is bustling with activity. The Doctor rests against a large blue barrel. The Red and Blue Kangs are present.)\nTHE DOCTOR: It's taking over the building floor by floor.\n(Bin Liner is on the Talky phone.)\nBIN LINER: Return to Red Kang Base and Ware Cleaners! Build High for Happiness.\n(She replaces the receiver onto it's position on the Drinking Machine.)\nTHE DOCTOR: Is Fire Escape going to join us?\n(Bin Liner nods.)\nTHE DOCTOR: Are all the Kangs here? Red? Blue?\nDRINKING FOUNTAIN: Yes. Except for those...\nTHE DOCTOR: Those who've been made unalive. Yes. Well, when Fire Escape gets here we must all make for the Great Pool in the Sky.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n6. EXT. FLOOR 304 / THE POOL\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The Yellow Pool Cleaner is attempting to drag Mel under the water. Her head goes under a few times but she struggles to remain above the surface of the water. Pex runs around the side of the pool in a state of confusion and panic.)\nMEL: Pex, do something!\nPEX: But what should I do?\nMEL: Anything!\n(The Cleaner bobs up and down in the water threatening Mel with its claws and mechanical tendrils that are wrapped around Mel's body.)\nPEX: Help! Help!\nMEL: Can't you think of anything else?\n(Again the Cleaner pulls Mel beneath to the surface of the water. When she struggles back up again, she makes a lunge in the direction of Pex, reaching for his gun.)\nMEL: Quick. Give me that!\n(She takes the gun from Pex and splashes her way out of the pool as the Cleaner advances after her. She turns and fires directly at it causing an explosion. The Cleaner buzzes and crackle and sinks to the bottom of the pool. Mel stands panting on the edge of the pool with Pex.)\nPEX: Mel, I did warn you.\n(Mel turns to look at Pex in frustrated disbelief.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n7. INT. THE CARETAKERS' HEADQUARTERS\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The Deputy Chief Caretaker stands in front of the bank of monitor screens as he addresses his fellow caretakers.)\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: Attention all Caretakers. Regulation ZZZ is now in operation. This overrides all other rules and regulations. I repeat, this overrides all other rules and regulations. All Caretakers to act with extreme caution and get back here as fast as they can.\n(The monitor screens display various Caretakers running down the corridors in response to his instructions.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n8. EXT. FLOOR 304 / THE POOL\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Mel and Pex are sitting on a lounger at the side of the pool. Mel has dried off and put her clothes back on. Pex looks very glum.)\nMEL: Pex.\nPEX: What?\nMEL: I'm sorry.\n(She is distracted by a sound coming from the other end of the pool - behind a curtain.)\nMEL: What's that?\nPEX: Where?\nMEL: Well there's a rustling sound coming from over there.\nPEX: I only checked it a few minutes ago.\nMEL: Shall I go?\nPEX: If you want.\n(Taking a deep breath, Mel puts her towel aside and walks as nonchalantly as possible towards the curtained-off area. Pex cautiously follows her, getting his gun out just in case. She pulls aside the curtains to see nothing there.)\nPEX: Nothing there?\nMEL: No.\nPEX: Sure?\nMEL: Of course. See for yourself.\n(Suddenly the Doctor bursts through the curtain, startling both Pex and Mel. Mel gasps but is then relieved.)\nMEL: Doctor!\nTHE DOCTOR: I'm sorry to give you such a shock, Mel, but this is where the Cleaner service lift appears to come out.\nMEL: Oh, Doctor, it's so good to see you!\nTHE DOCTOR: And you, Mel, and you!\n(The Doctor and Mel hug. The Doctor notices Pex and reaches out his hand and doffs his hat.)\nTHE DOCTOR: Um, how d'you do?\nMEL: This is Pex.\nTHE DOCTOR: Ah. I believe you've met my friends before.\n(The Doctor steps back and pulls the curtain back to reveal the Kangs. Pex takes up a defensive stance and eyes them suspiciously.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n9. INT. THE STREET\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Smoke starts to fill the corridor. A Caretaker appears at the end of it, clutching his throat and coughing. He falls to the ground dead. Kroagnon, inhabiting the Chief Caretaker's body, walks awkwardly down the corridor followed by a Cleaner that belches out smoke.)\nKROAGNON: Search hard, My Cleaners, search hard. Bring them all out! All the nasty human beings! The Caretakers! The Residents! The Kangs! All of them! We'll be back to collect the rubbish later.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n10. EXT. FLOOR 304 / THE POOL\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The Kangs are sitting in a united group along the side of the pool with Pex alone at the end. The Doctor and Mel are pacing up and down at the head of the pool.)\nMEL: Imagine building this beautiful pool and filling it with mechanical killers.\nTHE DOCTOR: The rest of the Towers would have been like this pool if he'd had his way. A killer in every corner.\nMEL: And you're sure Kroagnon's been let loose again?\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, very much so. But we know so little about his plans. He had years to brood over what he wants to do. But we've no time to come up with a counter plan.\n(Fire Escape moves over to Pex to taunt him, with the other seated Red and Blue Kangs willing her on.)\nFIRE ESCAPE: Did Mel make the creature unalive for you?\nDRINKING FOUNTAIN: And stop you being taken to the cleaners?\n(Pex nods his head shamefully.)\nFIRE ESCAPE: Then Mel is a Kang after all.\n(They all look around at the Doctor and Mel conversing at the other end of the Pool.)\nPEX: I'll show you all. I will put the world of Paradise Towers to rights.\nBIN LINER: Oh, yes?\nPEX: Yes!\nFIRE ESCAPE: You're a cowardly cutlet, Pex. You will always hide, always.\n(All the Kangs laugh at Pex. Mel and the Doctor watch the unruly group.)\nMEL: They shouldn't treat him like that.\nTHE DOCTOR: That's Paradise Towers in a nutshell, I'm afraid. The Red Kangs didn't trust the Blue Kangs. And none of them trusted the Caretakers. And the Rezzies, from your account, prey on whoever they can and trust no one either. And all of them despise poor old Pex. Oh, the Great Architect must be delighted. How are we going to unite the people of Paradise Towers to defeat him?\nMEL: We'll find a way. We have to.\n(The Doctor looks despairingly at Mel. All through their conversation, the Kang chants of \"He's a Cowardly Cutlet\" have been building, directed at Pex. Unable to take anymore, Pex storms off in the direction of the way out. He walks past the Doctor and Mel. She goes to follow him.)\nMEL: Pex, don't go. Pex!\n(All of those gathered around the pool are stunned into silence and stillness at the unexpected arrival of three Rezzies, lead by Maddy. She steps timidly forward to address them all.)\nMADDY: I... that is we... we the Rezzies... the remaining Rezzies that is, want to talk to you all. I think we may need your help.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n11. INT. THE CARETAKERS' HEADQUARTERS\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The Deputy Chief Caretaker sits alone, solemnly staring at the floor. The main door to the room opens with a hum and what the Deputy thinks is the Chief walks in - Kroagnon. The Deputy jumps up looking pleased.)\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: Well, Chiefy, I thought you were lost. I...\n(He stops as he sees two Cleaners through the doorway behind the Chief (Kroagnon). He notices the Chief's slightly odd appearance - he has a silvery sheen to his face and clothing. He starts to advance awkwardly towards the Deputy.)\nKROAGNON: The Towers have become appallingly dirty.\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: Sorry?\nKROAGNON: The whole place is polluted with flesh, living flesh.\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: Flesh? Did you say living flesh?\nKROAGNON: Yes.\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: But Chief, you...\nKROAGNON: Deputy, may I remind you that there is a rulebook and the rulebook says that the orders of the Chief Caretaker are never to be questioned.\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: Yes, yes. Of course, of course, Chief. Unless...\nKROAGNON: Unless...?\n(Kroagnon starts to advance menacingly towards the Deputy, who starts to back away in the direction of the door.)\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: Well, I think you may recall that there are certain cases specified when the rulebook can be overridden, and that is when the Chief Caretaker...\nKROAGNON: Yes...?\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: ...just isn't the Chief Caretaker.\n(The Deputy Chief Caretaker turns around and runs out of the door. He leaps over the Cleaners that are in the way and races down the corridor. Kroagnon goes to the door and addresses the Cleaners.)\nKROAGNON: Leave him. Leave him. We'll clean him up when we clean up all the others.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n12. EXT. FLOOR 304 / THE POOL\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The Doctor, Mel, Pex, the Red Kangs and the Blue Kangs are all gathered around to hear the information provided by the Rezzies who are seated on a sofa.)\nMADDY: The Cleaners have reached about floor 115 now. All the Rezzies, that can, have moved up to the higher floors, but not everyone was quick enough.\n(The Doctor points to the map on the table in the centre of everyone so that they can all see how high the Cleaners have reached.)\nTHE DOCTOR: And you're sure that person ordering the Cleaners to do this looks like the Chief Caretaker?\n(Maddy simply nods.)\nBIN LINER: But he's unalive, Doctor. We saw it.\nTHE DOCTOR: Exactly. So the Great Architect has taken over his body.\n(Fire Escape leans forward to cast accusations.)\nFIRE ESCAPE: Why should we believe her? Rezzies are full of untruth and Kangs. Rotten old rubber neck...\nTHE DOCTOR: Please, please, be quiet. Be quiet.\n(He hushes the Kang grumblings and reassures Maddy to continue as she consults, in hushed tones, with her fellow Rezzies.)\nMADDY: Of course, I know that we residents have not always been as neighbourly as we might have been. But some have been worse than others. And the worst have gone... down the waste disposal chute.\n(The Doctor looks disapprovingly at this. Mel and Pex exchange looks, remembering the event described.)\nMADDY: But those of us who are left want to let bygones be bygones. We're all in danger now and well, we're very sorry for what we did and we won't do it again. If we all survive that is. We need each other's help.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, you Kangs, what d'you say to that?\n(Drinking Fountain and another Blue Kang and Fire Escape and Bin Liner, representing the Red Kangs, get into a secret huddle to discuss, whilst the others wait. The huddle breaks up and they address the group.)\nBIN LINER: I won't say Rezzies are Ice Hot but yes she's not telling untruths. And yes, we'll help each other.\nTHE DOCTOR: All agreed? Pex?\nFIRE ESCAPE: Don't ask him. He's a cowardly cutlet.\nTHE DOCTOR: Fire Escape!! Pex?\n(Pex waits for silence and grimly nods his head.)\nFIRE ESCAPE: We work with Rezzies - no to-do. We work with Pex - no to-do. But the Caretakers?\n(All the Kangs get to their feet to proclaim as one voice.)\nKANGS: Never, ever!!!\n(Suddenly they have to spin around as they are interrupted by the subtle coughing of the Deputy Chief Caretaker who stands behind them.)\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: Excuse me. I'm sorry to intrude like this, but I wondered if I might have a word with you all.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n13. INT. THE CARETAKERS' HEADQUARTERS\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Kroagnon stands at a transparent map of Paradise Towers and, with a highlighting marker pen, he marks the last floor that Cleaners have reached.)\nKROAGNON: 170. All the messy creatures will be moving up to the swimming pool zone on floor 304. Luckily they won't have time to make it too untidy before I destroy them. I have nothing to fear. Nobody knows my Paradise Towers better than I do.\n(He sits down at the desk and watches blankly at the monitor screens displaying the Cleaners busily going about their killer sprees.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n14. EXT. FLOOR 304 / THE POOL\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Everyone stands ready, awaiting the planning process. The Doctor checks his watch and pockets it again.)\nTHE DOCTOR: We have very little time, so we must think clearly. Now Kroagnon, as we now must call the Chief Caretaker, is firmly installed in your headquarters. Am I right, Deputy Chief?\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: Yes, Doctor.\nTHE DOCTOR: So we must find a way of getting him out again.\nBIN LINER: Set a trap for him!\nTHE DOCTOR: Precisely.\nMADDY: We used to do that a lot with the rats.\nMEL: But what about the Cleaners?\nTHE DOCTOR: First, we must immobilise as many as we can.\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes?\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: I know it's against the rulebook to say this, but I suppose these are exceptional circumstances.\nTHE DOCTOR: They could be described thus, yes.\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: Well, on the 245 Sodium Street, Corridor 75, there's a secret emergency supply kept for pest going out of control.\nMEL: An emergency supply of what?\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: Explosives.\nMEL: That'll do it.\nFIRE ESCAPE: Ice Hot!\nBIN LINER: With explosives and arrogance we can blow out the Cleaners, no problem.\nDRINKING FOUNTAIN: Send the Cleaners to the Cleaners.\nALL: Yes!!\n(They all laugh.)\nMADDY: Most of the Rezzies make table cloths. We could throw them over the Cleaners to slow them down for you to shoot.\nFIRE ESCAPE: Ice Hot, Maddy!\nTHE DOCTOR: (to Mel) We seem to be getting somewhere at last.\n(Everyone seems jubilant at there ideas, there is lots of merriment and clapping.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n15. INT. THE CARETAKERS' HEADQUARTERS\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Kroagnon continues to make his marks on the transparent map.)\nKROAGNON: 163. Time to see what the human garbage is up to in the swimming pool zone.\n(He moves to the desk and activates a control. One monitor screen goes blank and the computer voice speaks out.)\nCOMPUTER VOICE: By express order of the Great Architect, surveillance of the swimming pool is not allowed. Not allowed.\n(Kroagnon growls with anger.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n16. EXT. FLOOR 304 / THE POOL\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The inhabitants of Paradise Towers in the swimming pool area are so overjoyed at their ideas they forget the urgency of the situation and need the Doctor to calm things.)\nTHE DOCTOR: Please! Please! We must move on to the main problem.\n(As silence is regained, the Doctor starts to wander around the pool to ponder. Bin Liner and Fire Escape follow him.)\nTHE DOCTOR: How to persuade Kroagnon to leave his safety and come to a place of our choosing where we can trap and defeat him.\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: He'll never leave there until we're all wiped out. We'll never manage to break. I should know that.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well there is a way that might just work.\nFIRE ESCAPE: What's that, Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: Well you see, Kroagnon is undoubtedly a very clever and very proud being, and like many clever and proud beings likes to be appreciated by his equals. Now, I think if he had the chance to meet such a person, he would leave his lair to do so.\nMEL: Doctor, you're not going to go and...\nTHE DOCTOR: I've no choice, Mel. I mean, in all honesty, I am the only obvious candidate.\nMEL: You'll go out there and show yourself and be killed.\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. That would be extremely futile. I will allow myself to be seen, and then somebody will go to Kroagnon and offer to lead him to me - right into our little trap. Now that person has a far more difficult and dangerous mission than I.\n(Everyone looks around awkwardly and goes silent until one person speaks out.)\nPEX: I will go to Kroagnon. I am Pex and I am the...\nFIRE ESCAPE: A Cowardly Cutlet.\n(All the Kangs laugh raucously. Pex is hurt but Mel looks on encouragingly.)\nPEX: Well you all have tasks to do. Caretakers, Residents, Kangs, why should only Pex be left out. Pex the trained fighting machine. Pex the only...\nBIN LINER: The scaredy cat.\n(Again their riotous laughter silences Pex.)\nMEL: Pex, are you sure you want to do this?\nPEX: Yes, I am.\nTHE DOCTOR: So be it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n17. INT. THE CARETAKERS' HEADQUARTERS\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The monitor screen continues to display the Cleaners going about their task of destruction. Kroagnon looks at his map but is interrupted by a bing from the control desk. Suddenly a screen comes to life and shows the Doctor's face. Kroagnon walks towards it.)\nTHE DOCTOR: Hello, there, Kroagnon. This is the Doctor speaking. I don't believe we've met, though no doubt you've heard of me.\n(Kroagnon just growls at the arrogance.)\nTHE DOCTOR: I thought so. Anyway, I'd heard so much about Paradise Towers I thought I'd come and take a look and, believe me, I'm very disappointed. It displays exactly what everyone says is your usual failure as an architect - not making allowances for people. Still, I'm sure if we managed to work together, we might just about make this place habitable. I've a few ideas which I might give to you if you can be bothered to listen. Bye for now.\n(The Doctor's screen goes black and Kroagnon again growls with anger.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n18. INT. THE STREET\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(A Cleaner moves into yet another corridor to gas yet more unfortunates. Maddy appears from one of the flats to address it. Behind Maddy are two other residents. It stops in its tracks to hear here speak.)\nMADDY: Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. I hope you don't mind my mentioning it, but I think you missed some rubbish in the street back there.\n(The Cleaner starts to turn around to return to the previous corridor.)\nMADDY: Charge!!\n(When its back is turned, Maddy ducks down and the two other residents rush forward and throw a table cloth over the Cleaner's eyes, blocking its vision. They then run off, and Drinking Fountain appears in another doorway and aims a bolt from her weapon, hitting the Cleaner. The Cleaner explodes and then falls silent.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n19. INT. THE RED KANG HEADQUARTERS\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(As the Kangs busy themselves gathering together essential pieces of equipment and setting up the explosive around the room, the Doctor and Mel are talking with Pex to prepare him.)\nTHE DOCTOR: Now, are you clear what you have to do, Pex?\nMEL: And you are sure you want to go through with it?\nPEX: I won't be unbrave again.\nTHE DOCTOR: Remember, Pex, you must get him out of the CARETAKERS' HEADQUARTERS as quick as you can so that he doesn't see what's happening to the Cleaner. But then, once he's out, take as long as you can. We need time, no heroics, just a cool clear head.\nPEX: I can manage.\nTHE DOCTOR: Good luck, Pex.\n(The Doctor shakes his hand and then walks off leaving Pex with Mel.)\nMEL: I've been asked to give you this, Pex. It's a Kang bracelet. They wanted to give it to you. They think you're not a scaredy cat any longer but a real Kang. Good luck, Pex.\n(She places the bracelet on his wrist and then kisses his cheek. He looks embarrassed. He gives Mel his gun.)\nPEX: You take this, Mel. Can't use it this time.\n(Fire Escape, Bin Liner and Mel watch Pex earnestly leave. Bin Liner hands him a stick of explosives.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n20. INT. THE STREET\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Another cleaner moves smoothly into the corridor but is confronted by Drinking Fountain and her weapon. She fires and yet another Cleaner is dispatched. Residents, Caretakers and Kangs join her as she celebrates its immobilising.)\nDRINKING FOUNTAIN: Come on, on to the next one.\n(They all move off, following here from the corridor, leaving the smoking remains of the Cleaner.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n21. INT. THE CARETAKERS' HEADQUARTERS\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Pex is displayed on one of the monitor screens as he boldly addresses Kroagnon.)\nKROAGNON: So you say you could lead me to this so-called Doctor who dares to mock me?\nPEX: Yes, he and the other... mobile rubbish have found a place to hide that they think you don't know about. And they're there planning ways of resistance.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKROAGNON: If you deliver me this Doctor, I'll give you a safe way out.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n22. INT. THE RED KANG HEADQUARTERS\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Mel descends the stairs into the room and goes to see the Doctor. Other Kangs are busying around with the explosives.)\nMEL: Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes?\nMEL: The door's nearly back in place anyway but they're having trouble with the fortamoliscope (sic) opening device.\nTHE DOCTOR: I better give them a hand. See what you can do to help the Kangs down there. Oh, and Mel, don't forget to leave the escape hatch uncovered so that I can make my exit.\n(He makes his way to the main entrance door and passes Bin Liner by its side.)\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh I just hope that Pex doesn't lose his nerve and hurry. Otherwise it won't be Kroagnon who's caught in a booby trap, it'll be us.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n23. INT. THE SQUARE\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Various Kangs are splattered around the square, out of sight from the approaching Pex and Kroagnon. Two Cleaners follow them.)\nKROAGNON: This is not some trick is it?\nPEX: No! No!\nKROAGNON: I've only just began to enjoy walking around my marvellous Towers in this body and I wouldn't deal very kindly with anybody who was stupid enough to lay a trap for me.\n(They stop just inside the square. Pex looks anxiously aside. Kroagnon taps Pex on the shoulder and startles him.)\nKROAGNON: Not frightened, are you?\nPEX: I... I think we ought to hurry, Great Architect. Please, let's hurry.\nKROAGNON: As you wish.\n(Pex walks off. Kroagnon goes to follow him but senses something around him. He turns but sees nothing behind him except for the TARDIS sitting in the corner covered in wallscrawl. He walks onwards, still awkwardly as he cannot quite handle the control of the Chief's body. The two Cleaners follow smoothly after him. When they have gone, the Kangs on the walkway above come from hiding and await a signal from below. A Kang appears and tells them to move on. They leave the square. Drinking Fountain goes to the talky phone in the square and contacts the others.)\nDRINKING FOUNTAIN: They're on their way.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n24. INT. THE RED KANG HEADQUARTERS\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Bin Liner replaces the receiver at her end after talking with Drinking Fountain. She is with Mel.)\nMEL: What's happening?\nBIN LINER: They're making all speed here.\nMEL: What!?!\nBIN LINER: Pex has been a scaredy cat. They'll be here in no time.\nTHE DOCTOR: I must tell the Doctor.\n(Mel runs for the door but Bin Liner stops her before she steps on the tripwires.)\nBIN LINER: Danger! Tripwires. This way.\n(Bin Liner leads Mel out through the \"unseen outway\".)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n25. INT. THE STREET\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The Doctor is with the Deputy Chief Caretaker and Fire Escape outside the Kang Headquarters. He is adjusting the door control.)\nTHE DOCTOR: That should do it.\n(The Deputy Chief Caretaker notices Kroagnon, Pex and the two Cleaners appear at the other end of the street.)\nDEPUTY CHIEF CARETAKER: Doctor! And we're not ready for him.\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, Pex. Move back, quickly.\nFIRE ESCAPE: Oh, but Doctor, he'll make you unalive.\n(Mel and Bin Liner appear on the street, having exited from the escape route.)\nTHE DOCTOR: There's only one way this might work, and for that I need to be on my own.\nMEL: Come on.\n(Mel, Bin Liner, Fire Escape and the Deputy all pull back to the other end of the Street, away from the Doctor. Kroagnon appears before the Doctor whilst Pex stand a little way behind him.)\nKROAGNON: Well!?!\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, now, Kroagnon. How nice of you to drop in. I'm so glad. I wanted to have a word with you about the shoddy design of this building. I mean, take this door for instance, look at it.\nKROAGNON: There was nothing wrong with it when I built it, unless humanoid creatures have damaged it.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, speaking as an expert, I'm prepared to tell the universe you couldn't design a simple doorknob. I mean, look.\n(Kroagnon growl as the Doctor points to the door. Kroagnon goes to look at it and the Doctor opens the door and attempts to push him inside. Kroagnon spins around and pushes the Doctor to his side. The others look on horrified. Pex makes to run away but the Cleaners stand in his way. He runs away in the other direction past the Doctor, who makes another attempt to push Kroagnon into the explosives-laden Kang Headquarters.)\nTHE DOCTOR: Pex!! Please!!\n(Pex runs into Mel who looks at him disappointed. He remembers his Kang bracelet and goes back to help the Doctor who is being pushed repeatedly against the wall by Kroagnon. Pex pushes the Doctor aside and shoves the stick of explosive that Bin Liner gave him earlier into Kroagnon's hand. With one great leap he manages to push Kroagnon off his feet and through the door into the Kang Headquarters. Instantly the darkened interior explodes, debris flying everywhere.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n26. INT. THE SQUARE\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(All the residents of Paradise Towers are gathered together to mourn and honour Pex. The Kangs stand around their memorial made from pieces of junk. The Rezzies and the Caretakers stand back looking on. Also present are the Doctor and Mel.)\nBIN LINER: Hail Pex. Hail the unalive who gave his life for the Towers. In life he was not a Kang but in death he was brave and bold as a Kang should be.\n(The Kangs, Red and Blue, stand as one and start to encircle the memorial.)\nKANGS: Hail Pex. Hail the unalive. Hail Pex. Hail the Unalive.\n(Mel and the Doctor look on.)\nMEL: Poor Pex.\nTHE DOCTOR: Indeed, poor Pex. But look, Mel, they're all here. The Caretakers, the Rezzies, the Kangs. This would never have happened before. Perhaps now they'll all start working together.\nMEL: Yes.\n(Fire Escape, Bin Liner and Drinking Fountain move over to join the Doctor and Mel.)\nTHE DOCTOR: Ah, Fire Escape. Now, have you managed to remove the Kang wallscrawls from the TARDIS as you promised?\nFIRE ESCAPE: Build High for Happiness, Doctor.\n(She passes the Doctor his umbrella with a sheepish grin.)\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much.\nDRINKING FOUNTAIN: We're sorry you must go, Doctor and Mel. We've made you an honorary Kang, Doctor.\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, a Blue Kang or a Red Kang?\n(She passes a blue scarf over to the Doctor and Fire Escape shows him that it is red on the other side.)\nFIRE ESCAPE: Both.\nTHE DOCTOR: Ah, well I'll be honoured to wear it.\n(He doffs his hat to them as they move off to join the procession.)\nTHE DOCTOR: And all my best wishes to the future of Paradise Towers.\n(The Doctor and Mel wave goodbye to the others standing present and move over to the other side of the square where the TARDIS in standing waiting to depart. Mel unlocks the door. The Doctor doffs his hat to the same piece of metal rubbish that he said hello to when they arrived.)\nTHE DOCTOR: Goodbye.\nMEL: No, Doctor.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well you never can tell.\n(They both go inside the TARDIS and once the door is shut, the familiar whizzing and groaning sound echoes around the square. Once the TARDIS has gone it reveals a piece of writing scrawled on the wall. \"Pex Lives\".)\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The Doctor and Mel arrive in Paradise Towers, a futuristic city where the residents are divided into two factions: the Kangs and the Rezzies. The Doctor and Mel are immediately targeted by the Kangs, who are led by Kroagnon. The Doctor and Mel are rescued by Pex, a young boy who is a member of the Rezzies. Pex is killed by Kroagnon, but his death unites the Kangs and Rezzies in a common cause. The Doctor and Mel leave Paradise Towers, but they leave behind a message that Pex lives on.</s>【我为群众办实事】“我为群众办实事”实践活动—— 市妇联开展“把爱带回家”2022寒假儿童关爱服务活动"

QUEEN MANSION - DAY\nOliver walks into the sitting room where Moira Queen is sitting on the couch with Walter standing behind the couch and Thea Queen standing next to the couch.\nNewscaster (voiceover): Over the past 15 years, Mr. Redman has withdrawn more than 30 million dollars from the plant's account. Mr. Redman claims refunding the Halcyon pension plan has always been his intent. But sources say Redman was coerced by the vigilante. Sketch of the Arrow appears on the television with the caption reading MYSTERIOUS HOODED VIGILANTE. Oliver extends his arm in disbelief toward the television.\nOliver: This guy gets more air-time than the Kardashians, right?\nThea: Five years on an island and you still know who they are.\nOliver: I've been catching up. It's nice to see how much our culture has improved while I was away.\nMoira: No, the city used to be different. People used to feel safe.\nThea: Oh, what's the matter, Mom? Afraid we're gonna be next?\nWalter: Do you have any questions about today, Oliver? It's a simple proof-of-life declaration. Moira stands up and Walter straightens his suit jacket.\nWalter: Just read out a brief, prepared statement to the judge, and then your death-in-absentia judgment will be voided.\nOliver: It's fine, Walter, I've been in a courtroom before. Tommy enters.\nTommy: Four times by my estimate. You know, there was the DUI, the assault on that paparazzi douchebag, stealing that taxi, which was just awesome, by the way, and who could forget peeing on the cop?\nMoira: I wish everyone would.\nOliver: I'd hang, but we're headed to court.\nTommy: I know, that's why I'm here. My best friend is getting legally resurrected, I wouldn't miss this for the world.\nOliver (whispering): Right. Okay. (normal volume to Thea) What about you?\nThea: Oh, I think the first four times of you in court was enough for me.\nOliver: Fair enough. Thea walks out of the room. Diggle enters.\nDiggle: Mrs. Queen? Car's ready. Diggle, Moira, Walter exit.\nTommy: Walter.\nEXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY\n(PRESS CLAMORING)\nMan: Mr. Queen, can we get a comment, sir?\nWoman: ...return to civilization after five years on a deserted island.\nMan 2: Can you tell us what happened on that island, Mr. Queen?\nFLASHBACK\nOliver and Sara on are thrown from the bed as the boat starts to sink. Sara screams.\nEND FLASHBACK\nMan: Tell us about the accident, Mr. Queen.\n(CAMERAS CLICKING)\nWoman: 5 years on an island.\nFLASHBACK\nOliver watches Sara slide away. Oliver reaches for Sara's hand.\nOliver: Sara!\n(Sara SCREAMING)\nEND FLASHBACK\nINT. COURTROOM - DAY\nOliver: There was a storm. The boat went down. I was the only survivor.\nFLASHBACK\nThe boat is sinking and rain pours from the sky. Oliver, his Father, and another man are on a life raft.\nOliver: She's out there!\nFather: She's not there!\nOliver: Sara!\nEND FLASHBACK\nOliver: My father didn't make it.\nFLASHBACK\nFather holds a gun to his head.\nOliver: No!\n(GUNSHOT)\nEND FLASHBACK\nOliver: I almost died, I... I thought that I had, because I spent so many days on that life raft before I saw the island.\nFLASHBACK\nOliver (voiceover): When I reached it, I knew...\nOliver crawls onto the island, coughing.\nOliver (voiceover): I knew that I was gonna have to live for both of us.\nEND FLASHBACK\nOliver: And in those five years, it was that one thought that kept me going.\nLawyer: Your Honor, we move to vitiate the death-in-absentia filed after Oliver's disappearance at sea aboard the Queen's Gamut five years ago. Unfortunately we will not be requesting that the declaration of death filed for the petitioner's father, Robert Queen, be rescinded. The Queen family is only entitled to one miracle, I'm afraid.\nINT. COURTHOUSE - DAY\nMoira: Now, onto the offices. Everyone is waiting to meet you there.\nOliver: Uh, Mom, that was, uh...a little bit heavier than I was expecting it to be. Can we do that tomorrow? Please?\nMoira: Of course.\nOliver: Thank you.\nWalter and Moira walk away.\nTommy: Last week, you couldn't wait to get to the company.\nOliver: Tommy, I'd just spent five years away from civilization. I wasn't exactly thinking straight. Oliver and Tommy run into Laurel.\nOliver: I... Hi.\nTommy: Hi.\nLaurel: What are you doing here?\nOliver: Oh, they were bringing me back from the dead. Legally speaking. What are you doing here?\nLaurel: My job.\nOliver: Right.\nLawyer: More like the D.A.'s. Oliver extends his hand to Emily, standing to the right of Laurel.\nOliver: Hi, Oliver Queen. Emily shakes his hand.\nEmily: Emily Nocenti.\nLaurel: Oliver just got back from five years on an uncharted island. Before that, he was cheating on me with my sister. He was with her when she died. And last week, he told me to stay away from him. It was really good advice. Excuse me. Laurel walks past Oliver and Tommy.\nEmily: It was nice to meet you.\nLawyer: Yeah. Let's go. They walk past Oliver and Tommy to follow Laurel.\nTommy: Come on, buddy, shake it off. Let's go.\nEXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY\nReporter: Mr. Somers, one question, sir.\nSomers: I don't know what I've done to earn this witch-hunt from Miss Lance and her bosses at the CNRI. But I can tell you this. I am an honest businessman, and I will fight this slander to my last dime and breath. That's all I have to say, thank you.\n(REPORTERS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)\nReporter 2: There's Mr. Queen!\n(REPORTERS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)\nReporter: Tell us what happened inside, Mr. Queen...\nDiggle walks with Oliver and Tommy to the car.\nDiggle: Step back everybody, please.\nReporter: Can you give us a couple comments about the island, Mr. Queen? Before you go, sir, please. Couple of comments about the island, sir.\nReporter 2: What happened in there?\nDiggle: All right. Everybody step back. Diggle shoves the reporters away.\nDiggle (angrily): Hey man, I'll make you swallow that Nikon! Back!\n(CAR DRIVING AWAY)\nDiggle and Tommy watch the car leave.\nTommy: This happens to you a lot, doesn't it? Diggle is obviously frustrated.\nINT. COURTROOM - DAY\nLaurel: How much is a life worth? A life of a man, a good man, a stevedore on the docks of the city in which we live.\nFLASHBACK\nSomers is standing while two men drag Victor Nocenti toward him.\nLaurel (voiceover): A father.\nEND FLASHBACK\nLaurel: A man with a daughter. The plaintiff will prove by a preponderance of evidence that Victor Nocenti learned that his boss, that man sitting right there, Martin Somers, was taking bribes from the Chinese Triads to smuggle drugs into our city.\nFLASHBACK\nLaurel (voiceover): And when Victor Nocenti threatened to tell the police,\nMan slits Victor's throat. (CHOKING) Martin Somers had him killed.\nEND FLASHBACK\nLaurel: Mr. Somers is very well-connected, and has friends in the District Attorney's office. Which is why, if Emily Nocenti is to get justice for her father's death, if Martin Somers is to get justice for his crimes, then someone is going to have to do it for them.\nINT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\nOliver is shirtless, showing all of the scars he had gotten on the island, and starts climbing a thick rope. The camera pans to several green arrowheads on a table.\nOliver (voiceover): Martin Somers. Laurel's targeted the worst of Starling City, so it's no surprise his name is on my father's list. Camera pans to father's list. Camera pans to Oliver practicing sword skills on metal bars.\nOliver (voiceover): The city's police and the D.A. can't stop him, or won't. Laurel thinks she's the only one willing to bring him to justice. She's wrong.\nINT. SHIPPING DOCK WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\nSomers: You, listen up. The longer this goes on, the more likely the media is gonna crucify me. You shut this trial down, do you understand me?\n(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)\nMan: Yes, sir.\n(LIGHTS FLASH ON AND OFF)\n(BLOWS LANDING)\n(MEN GROANING)\n(MUTTERS)\nSomers looks around as the light come back on. The two men in the warehouse are lying on the ground, face-down.\nSomers: What... What... Somers is pulled away by a quick rope around the neck.\n(CHOKING)\nEXT. SHIPPING WAREHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT\n(GRUNTS)\nCamera opens with Somers' upside-down view of the Arrow. Camera flips right side-up.\nArrow: Martin Somers...\nSomers: Who the hell are you?\nArrow: ...you've failed this city. Arrow lodges an arrow in his bow and aims at Somers.\nSomers: No! No, no, no, no, no! Arrow shoots next to Somers.\nArrow: You're gonna testify in that trial. You're gonna confess to having Victor Nocenti killed. Camera shows upside-down view of the Arrow.\nArrow: There won't be a second warning. Arrow shoots an arrow that grazes Somers' right cheek.\n(SCREAMING IN PAIN)\n(MUTTERING)\nCamera pans out and Arrow is gone.\nINT. QUEEN MANSION - NIGHT\nMoira: I hired you to protect my son. Now, I'm not a professional bodyguard, but it seems to me that the first requirement would be managing to stay next to the man you're hired to protect.\nDiggle: With all due respect, ma'am, I never had a client who didn't want my protection.\nMoira: I hired you. That makes me the client. Now where do you think my son is going on these chaperone-less excursions?\nDiggle: Ma'am, I truly do not know.\nOliver walks into the room.\nOliver: And he truly doesn't.\nMoira: Then perhaps you'd like to share with me, you know, where it is you run off to.\n(Oliver CHUCKLES)\nOliver: I've been alone for five years.\nMoira: I know that, Oliver.\nOliver: Mom... Alone.\nMoira: I see.\nOliver: I promise to introduce her if it ever gets to the exchanging first names stage...\nMoira: No, I'd rather you promised to take Mr. Diggle with you on your next rendezvous. It's not safe, you've already been abducted once. There is a maniac out there, hunting the wealthy.\nOliver: That maniac saved my life.\nMoira: This isn't a game. I lost you once. And I am not going through that again.\nOliver: Okay. Dig's my guy.\nMoira: Thank you.\nMoira walks out of the room, leaving Oliver and Diggle alone.\nOliver: Sorry to give you so much grief.\nDiggle: I served three tours in Afghanistan, Mr. Queen. You don't even come close to my definition of \"grief.\" But I tell you what... You ditch me one more time, no one will have to fire me. Diggle walks away, passing Thea dressed in a red dress.\nOliver: Where you going?\nThea: Uh... Somewhere loud and smoky. And don't bother trying to pickpocket my stash this time, because I'm gonna go get drunk instead.\nOliver: Thea, do you think this is what Dad would want for you?\nThea: Dead people don't want anything. It's one of the benefits of being dead. Oliver:I was dead. And I wanted a lot.\nThea: Except for your family. You've been home a week, and all you do is avoid Mom, ignore Walter, and judge me.\n(Oliver SIGHING)\nThea: Don't wait up.\nThea walks out of the house.\nINT. SHIPPING WAREHOUSE - DAY\nQuentin, Somers, and a group of policemen are in the warehouse. Quentin is pacing.\nQuentin: Well, I owe you an apology, Mr. Somers. We come all the way down to your docks, and it turns out, you don't need the police after all.\nSomers: Which is exactly what I've been saying.\nQuentin: Yeah. So I guess that 9-1-1 call that we got last night from your stevedore, saying that you were getting attacked by a guy in a green hood and a bow and arrow... I-I guess...I guess that, well... Hmm. Was that a practical joke?\nSomers: These guys like to fool around.\nQuentin: Yeah.\n(Quentin SCOFFING)\nQuentin: Well, you know, I'd be very much inclined to believe an honest, upstanding businessman like yourself, except, well, one of my men found this at your docks.\nQuentin pulls a green arrow out of an evidence bag and shows it to Somers.\nQuentin: You see, there's this vigilante running around. He thinks he's some kind of Robin Hood. He's robbing the rich, he's trying to teach them a lesson I guess. I don't know, I don't know. But the point is... the man's a killer. And nothing, and no one, is going to stop me from bringing him down. But like you said... Quentin sticks the arrows into a slot in the desk. It's a perfect fit. Somers frowns, obviously hiding something.\nQuentin: Hmm! ...clearly, nothing happened here last night.\nSomers: Isn't this a conflict of interest, Detective? After all, your daughter is suing me.\nQuentin: I'm pretty good at keeping my emotions in check.\nSomers: I'm not. Somers stands up and threateningly gets in Quentin's space.\nSomers: You and your daughter don't want to find out what I'm capable of when I get emotional.\n(Quentin SCOFFS)\n(Quentin SIGHING)\nQuentin walks and the other policemen walk out. Somers looks nervously at the arrow in his desk.\nINT. QUEEN CONSOLIDATED - DAY\nWalter walks off of the elevator, followed by Moira, Oliver, and Diggle.\nWalter: As you can see, Oliver, we've modernized quite a bit.\n(Oliver WHISTLING)\nOliver: Ooh. Hi.\n(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)\nMoira: Are you enjoying yourself?\nOliver: Yes, I am.\nWalter: I remember when your father used to bring you here when you were a boy. You always were so excited.\nOliver: Dad let me drink soda in the office.\nMoira: Ah, so that's why you enjoyed coming.\nINT. OFFICE - DAY\nWalter: The Queen Consolidated's success of late is a result of its targeted diversification. We have been making impressive inroads in cutting-edge fields like bio-tech and clean energy.\nOliver: That's neat. (to secretary) Excuse me? Can I get a sparkling water, or something cold, please?\nMoira: Sweetheart, Oliver, Walter and I have something to discuss with you. Come, please sit.\nOliver: Mom, it makes me nervous when you ask me to sit down.\nWalter: The company's about to break ground on a new site for the Applied Sciences division, and we would like to honor your father by dedicating the building in his name.\nOliver: Nice.\nMoira: And we'd like to make an announcement at the dedication that you will be taking a leadership position in the company.\nOliver: No.\nMoira: No, your... Your company.\nOliver: No, I don't want to lead anything. Besides, Walter is doing a very good job here.\nMoira: You said that you wanted to be a different person. You are Robert Queen's son.\nOliver: I don't need to be reminded of that.\nMoira: Well, obviously you do.\nWalter: Everyone here understands that this transition is really difficult for you.\nOliver: Thank you, Walter. Which part, though? Everyone fantasizing that I got my MBA while I was on the island? Or the fact that my father's CFO now sleeps down the hall from me?\nMoira starts walking away, but turns around and looks at Oliver.\nMoira: You know, five years ago, your irresponsibility was somewhat charming. It is a lot less so now. Moira walks out and Walter goes after her.\nEXT. QUEEN CONSOLIDATED - NIGHT\nDiggle walks out of the building ahead of Oliver to keep him from the press.\nReporter: There he is!\n(CAMERAS CLICKING)\n(PRESS CLAMORING)\nDiggle escorts Oliver through the horde of reporters. They both get into the backseats of a car.\nDiggle: The driver will be here in a minute.\nOliver: Okay.\nDiggle: You know, I spent the first 27 years of my life in Starling City, and the next five in Afghanistan. You want to know what I learned?\nOliver: There's no place like home?\nDiggle: No, just the opposite. Home is a battlefield. Back home, they're all trying to get you. Get you to open up, be somebody you're not sure you are anymore. Oliver seems to be far away and deep in thought.\nDiggle: Or I could be wrong. Maybe after five years alone, you're not as messed up in the head as you have every right to be.\nFLASHBACK\nOliver is lying on the ground.\n(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)\nOliver: Hey!\nSeagulls are swarming around the life raft that had washed onto the shore.\nOliver: Hey, get away! Oliver starts running toward the raft.\nOliver: Hey!\n(COUGHING)\nThere is an orange bag holding a body in the raft.\nOliver: Dad? Oliver kneels by the raft and takes the hand of the dead man. He jumps up and starts throwing up, collapsing on his hands and kneels.\n(SEAGULLS GET LOUDER)\nOliver scrambles back toward his father.\nOliver: Hey! Hey, stay away from him!\n(COUGHING)\nOliver lifts his father's body over his shoulder.\n(GRUNTING)\nOliver starts walking away with the body.\nEND FLASHBACK\nINT. LAW FIRM - DAY\nLawyer, Laurel, and Emily are walking together.\nLawyer: Well, we anticipate that Somers' attorney will try and paint you as blinded by grief or looking to make a buck.\nEmily: This isn't about the money. I just want justice for my father.\nLaurel: Emily, there are a lot of people who don't want this trial to proceed. Dangerous people.\nEmily: My mother died when I was a baby, and my father has been the only family I've ever known and they slit his throat. They are going to have to kill me if they want me to give this up.\nLaurel: Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that. Quentin walks into the room with three police officers.\nQuentin: And it won't.\nLaurel: What's going on?\nQuentin: What's going on is that the three of you are getting around-the-clock police protection. Okay? Get used to their faces, because they're going with you everywhere you go. No arguments.\nLaurel: I'm a lawyer. I live to argue.\nQuentin: I'm your father. I live to keep you safe.\nLawyer: Um, Emily, let's go grab a cup of coffee, okay?\nQuentin: Yes, why not do that? Thank you. (to officers) Please, go with them. (to last officer)Stay there.\nLaurel: Protective custody? I seem to recall you trying that once I discovered boys. It didn't work then either.\n(Quentin SIGHING)\nQuentin: This isn't a joke, Laurel. Martin Somers got attacked last night.\nLaurel: What?\nQuentin: Yeah.\nLaurel: By who?\nQuentin: It doesn't matter. Point is, you have whipped up a storm with these guys, and until the dust settles you'll be protected, okay? End of discussion.\nLaurel: That might have worked when I was eight. But it's not gonna work anymore.\nQuentin: End of discussion, Laurel! You're insistent on doing your job. That's great. But this is me doing mine, okay? And not just as a father, but as a cop. These people, they are more dangerous than you are willing to admit. And you've made them angry.\nINT. SHIPPING WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\nSomers sitting at his desk. Woman walks in wearing red dress.\nSomers: Thank you for coming.\nWoman: Anything for a friend.\nSomers: We're not friends. You smuggle drugs, I let you use my port.\nWoman: For which you're paid a lot of money.\nSomers: I don't get paid enough to have arrows shot at me. You need to take this guy seriously. He is a bigger threat to your operation than Nocenti ever was.\nWoman: Except now it's Nocenti's daughter who's the problem. Unlike your friend with the hood, we know where to find her.\nSomers: Don't be an idiot. You take out Emily Nocenti, and Laurel Lance will never let this go. She won't stop until she burns you, me, and then the entire Triad to the ground.\nWoman: Then we kill Miss Lance. Somers looks clearly nervous.\nINT. OLIVER'S ROOM - DAY\nNewscaster: Attorney for shipping magnate, Martin Somers,\nOliver walks into the scene. His shirt is off, showing the scars in his back, sides, and arms.\nNewscaster: has confirmed his client has no intention of testifying, maintaining his innocence in the wrongful death of Victor Nocenti. Nocenti's body was found four weeks ago. We'll keep you updated as more information becomes available.\nThea walks into the room and sees Oliver's scars as he puts a shirt on.\nThea: Wait, how did you get those?\n(Oliver SIGHING)\nOliver (frustrated): Don't you knock?\nThea pulls back his shirt to get a better look at his scars. Oliver frowns at his sister's insistent behavior.\nThea: No, wait... Mom said that there were scars, but... I-I'm... Oliver, what happened to you out there?\nOliver: I don't want to talk about it. Oliver closes and buttons his shirt.\n(Thea SCOFFS)\nThea: Of course you don't. You never want to talk to me about anything. Except for my social life.\nThea starts walking out. Oliver turns to her.\nOliver: Wait! Where are you going?\nThea: Why should I tell you?\nOliver: I'm sorry, Thea. I need to get better at talking about what happened to me there. But I'm not ready yet. Okay?\nThea: Do you have a second?\nOliver: Yeah.\nThea: Good. I wanna show you something out back.\nEXT. QUEEN MANSION - DAY\nThea and Oliver walking with the mansion in the background.\nThea: Sometimes, when I felt... Whatever... I'd come here. Camera shows two gravestones. One says: ROBERT QUEEN 1958-2007 A leader, a husband Thea kneels in front of the gravestone and starts dusting off the bottom.\nThea: About a month after the funerals, Mom stopped going out. Pretty soon, she stopped talking altogether. Oliver looks at the stones and Thea stands.\nThea: The house got so quiet, so I'd come here. To talk to you. Thea points to the other gravestone. The stone says: OLIVER QUEEN 1985-2007 A loving son and brother, whose light was dimmed far too soon.\nThea: I mean, stupid stuff. Like what I was doing that day, what boy I had a crush on... And then sometimes, I'd ask you, beg you, to find your way home to me. Now, here you are. And the truth is, I felt closer to you when you were dead. Look, I know it was hell where you were. But it was hell here too. You gotta let me in, Ollie. You gotta let someone in. Thea walks away. Camera shows Oliver's gravestone again.\nINT. LAUREL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nLaurel is sitting in a chair, leaning over her laptop.\n(KNOCK ON DOOR)\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\n(KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK)\nLaurel answers the door and sees Oliver. She isn't happy.\nOliver: Hi. Are you okay? There are two cop cars outside.\nLaurel: How am I supposed to stay away from you if you won't stay away from me?\nOliver: I...\nLaurel: What are you doing here, Ollie?\nOliver: My sister took... She pointed out to me that I have been distant since I got back and that... It would probably be a good idea if I let somebody in.\nLaurel: So, you thought you'd start with the first person you pushed away.\nOliver: I did that to protect you. And then I saw you yesterday, and I realized that I hurt you.\n(Laurel SIGHING)\nLaurel steps aside, letting Oliver into her apartment.\nOliver: Thank you. They walk around the apartment.\nOliver: Wow. This place hasn't changed in five years. (CHUCKLING)\nLaurel (frustrated): I haven't really had time to redecorate.\nOliver: I'm a jerk. Before the island, I was a jerk. And now I'm just a... I'm a damaged jerk.\nLaurel: What's in the bag? Oliver swings the brown paper bag in his hand.\nOliver: I thought about many things on the island, but there was one thing that I thought about every day. I actually dreamed about it, and I promised myself that if I ever got a chance to do it again, I'd do it with you. Oliver holds up a tub of ice cream.\nOliver: Eat ice cream. Oliver sits on the floor and Laurel sits on her couch eating ice cream. He puts the ice cream on the table.\nOliver: This is as good as I remember. My mother wants me to join the company. Laurel smirks.\nOliver: Yeah. Take my rightful place.\nLaurel: I can't exactly picture you as master of the universe.\nOliver: You know, after five years, I have plans. I have things that I have to do. I can't do that if I'm... I don't know... Attending board meetings and stockholder briefings.\nLaurel: Oliver? You're an adult. You can say no.\nOliver: Oh, I tried. Didn't take.\nLaurel: Well, then don't tell her. Show her. Be the person that you want her to see you as. Trust me. I have plenty of experience with disapproving parents.\nOliver: I have been on the receiving end of your father's disapproval.\nLaurel: He blames himself more than he blames you. He thinks that, you know, maybe if he and Sara were closer, she would have told him about the boat trip. And he could have stopped her from going with you.\nOliver: I am sorry.\nLaurel: You apologized already.\nOliver: And it'll never be enough.\n(THUD)\nOliver: Did you hear that?\nLaurel: What?\n(SOFT FOOTSTEP)\nOliver takes a butter knife and stands up.\nOliver: There's someone on the fire escape.\nLaurel: Wh-What? Oliver grabs Laurel's hand and starts running with her.\nOliver: Hey, come on... Come on! They run toward the door and a man breaks through the door with a machine gun into Laurel's apartment. Oliver pulls Laurel the other way.\n(MACHINE GUN FIRING)\n(LAUREL SCREAMS)\nAnother man crashes in through Laurel's bedroom window.\n(GUNSHOTS)\nThe woman from the warehouse enters and puts her fists up for a fight.\n(GUN CLICKS)\n(GUNSHOTS)\nOne of the men with guns is shot. The woman runs. Diggle enters and shoots another man. The woman knocks the gun from Diggle's hands and they fight.\n(BOTH GRUNTING)\nOliver is struggling with whether or not to help or keep his skills secret. Oliver leaves Laurel and runs into the kitchen for a knife. The woman pins Diggle and raises her hand to stab him. Oliver throws his knife and knocks the woman's knife away. The woman gets up and runs out of the apartment. Laurel runs into Oliver's arms. Diggle stands and gets his gun.\nDiggle: Are you hurt?\nOliver: No.\nDiggle (yelling): Are you hurt, Mr. Queen?\nOliver: No! No.\nDiggle: This is why it's a good idea to have a bodyguard.\n(SIRENS BLARING)\nOliver (softly): Hey, you okay?\n(SIREN WAILING)\nINT. LAUREL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nSeveral cops and medics are in the apartment. Diggle, Laurel and Oliver stand watching. Quentin walks in. Quentin and Laurel hug.\nLaurel: Daddy!\nQuentin: Oh, thank God. Thank God. Are you all right?\nLaurel: I'm okay. Those cops that you put on me...\n(Quentin SIGHING)\nQuentin: They...\nDiggle: I went outside to ask for a light, and they were both dead in the squad car.\nLaurel covers her mouth in tears.\nQuentin: It's okay. Mr. Diggle, thank you. Feel free to run as many red lights in the city as you want.\nDiggle: I was just doing my job, sir.\nQuentin: No, your job is protecting him. (to Oliver) It seems like whenever you're with one of my daughters, people die. You stay away from Laurel, or I swear the next time you disappear, it will be permanent.\nLaurel: Dad!\nQuentin: No, Laurel...\nOliver: It's okay. I understand.\nQuentin: Yeah. Laurel.\nINT. QUEEN MANSION - NIGHT\nOliver tosses a towel to Diggle and starts walking away. Diggle stands and walks after Oliver.\nOliver: I'd say thank you, but I don't think that would cover it.\nDiggle: Well, like I told your cop friend, I was just doing my job. Besides, I think it should be you that I'm thanking. Oliver stops and turns around with a fake confused look.\nOliver: What for?\nDiggle: The knife.\nOliver: The knife. I got lucky.\nDiggle: That was a kitchen knife. It wasn't even weighted properly, yet you threw it with accuracy across a 10-foot room.\nOliver: Exactly. I got lucky.\nDiggle: I'm not the kind of man you want to take for a fool, Mr. Queen. You understand me?\nOliver: Yes.\nDiggle: And I think I'm just beginning to understand the kind of man you are.\nOliver: Shouldn't take you very long. I'm shallow. And very tired, so... Good night.\nDiggle (smirking): Good night, sir.\nINT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\nOliver is dressed as Arrow in his warehouse. He is putting on his gloves.\nOliver (voiceover): I wanted to give Martin Somers the chance to confess and face a court's justice, but he chose to go after someone I care about instead.\nArrow puts on his belt and quiver. Arrow flips on his hood.\nOliver: He's still going to face justice.\nArrow opens a crate and takes out his bow.\nOliver: It'll just be a different kind.\nINT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\nSomers is packing files with another man in the room.\nSomers: Triad bitch screwed up the hit on Lance. Now, the Triad is gonna erase every ounce of evidence of their smuggling operation, including me. Except that's not gonna happen. Tell Wallace to get the boat ready. I'm leaving tonight.\nMan (on radio): Wallace? Wallace, you copy? Wallace?\nArrow (on radio): Wallace isn't here. But I am.\nSomers: We need to move, now. Move!\nMan: Sir, we've got six men up there.\nSomers: It's not enough. Move it!\nINT. LAUREL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nQuentin: You're gonna go back into that courtroom tomorrow, and you're gonna recuse yourself from this case, all right? Or drop it. Either way, you're done.\nLaurel: If you think I'm gonna abandon Emily Nocenti, then you don't know me all that well.\nQuentin: You don't know me well, young lady. I will lock you in a cell if that's what it takes.\nLaurel stands up.\nLaurel: Well, I guess that's what it's gonna take then.\nQuentin: Damn it, Laurel! I thought after what happened with Sara, you'd stop being just so reckless.\nLaurel: It's not about being reckless! It's just the opposite. I'm trying to make this city safer, just like you.\nQuentin: Sweetie. You're my only daughter, Laurel. You're all I have left to live for.\nLaurel: But what you want from me isn't living. Having cops around, not being able to do my job.\nQuentin: Your job is not going after people like the Triad or Somers.\nLaurel: My job is to use the law to fight for what is right. Just like you taught me.\nQuentin: Well, that's dirty: using me against me. You can't do that.\nLaurel: Well... Maybe I picked that up along the way, too.\n(Quentin LAUGHS)\n(CELL PHONE RINGING)\nQuentin (into phone): Lance.\nMan on phone: Sir, we got a report from the warfside, Somers Imports.\nQuentin: I'll be right there. (hangs up phone) I gotta go. Something's going on at the docks.\nINT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\n(MACHINE GUN FIRING)\nArrow shoots an arrow into a man. He jumps along the high metal beams and jumped to the ground, crouching. Arrow shoots another man. A third man rounds the corner with a machine gun and Arrow jumps over the side of a fence in the warehouse. Arrow shoots another man and runs toward a fifth, shooting him.

The Triad will kill me.\nArrow: The Triad's not your concern right now. Arrow shoots another arrow between Somers' legs.\n(WHIMPERING LOUDLY)\nSomers: All right, all right, all right. (shakily) It wasn't me that killed him. It was the Triad.\nArrow: Acting on whose instructions?\nArrow shoots again above Somers' head.\n(Somers SCREAMING)\nArrow (yelling): Whose?\nSomers: All right, all right. It was mine. It was mine, all right? Nocenti said he was gonna testify against me.\nArrow turns around and sees the Woman that attacked in Laurel's apartment.\nWoman (in foreign language): Move away from him.\nArrow (in same foreign language): Make me. Arrow and the Woman fight. They both are very skilled.\n(GRUNTING)\n(SIRENS APPROACHING)\nWoman knocks Arrow to the ground.\nPoliceman (over megaphone): This is the police. Drop your weapons. Arrow and the Woman run in opposite directions.\nPoliceman (over megaphone): You are surrounded. Come out with your hands in the air. Arrow runs outside and climbs over a storage unit. He starts to run and stops at the click of a gun.\nQuentin (pointing gun): Freeze! You twitch and you're dead. Bow down, hands up. Arrow grabs an arrow from his leg sheath and throws it at Quentin. Quentin drops his gun.\n(SIRENS WAILING)\n(GRUNTS)\nQuentin stumbles back and looks around to see no trace of the Arrow, other than a blinking arrow holding his gun to the storage unit. Quentin presses a button on the blinking arrow.\n(RECORDING REWINDING)\n(RECORDING PLAYS)\nSomers: All right, all right. It was mine. It was mine, all right? Nocenti said he was gonna testify against me.\nQuentin (looking around): You son of a bitch.\n(SIRENS WAILING)\nINT. OLIVER'S WAREHOUSE - DAY\nArrow puts his bow away.\nOliver (voiceover): Laurel was right. I can't be the Oliver my mother wants me to be and still keep the promise I made to my father. Arrow starts taking off his outfit.\nOliver (voiceover): I have to be the person I need them to see me as.\nEXT. ROBERT QUEEN MEMORIAL APPLIED SCIENCES CENTER - DAY\nTommy: Oh! Excuse me, ladies. (walking up to Laurel) Okay, this is a surprise. Did you show up here by mistake?\nLaure: By invitation. Oliver invited me last night.\nTommy: Last night?\nLaurel: Is that surprise or jealousy I'm hearing?\nTommy: Look, I just don't want him to find out anything, okay? Oliver has been through a lot.\nLaurel: Tommy, we've all been through a lot.\nWalter: Good afternoon. And thank you all for coming. Welcome to the future site of the Robert Queen Memorial Applied Sciences Center.\nEveryone applauds.\nWalter: Now, this is a building that will stand as a monument to the man whose company and vision are his greatest legacies.\nOliver: Whoa! Whoa! Oliver walks over and takes a drink of champagne.\nOliver: What about me? Right? I'm a legacy. Hey! Thanks for warming them up, Walt. (grunts and gets onto stage) All right. Ow! Fine, fine shovel. I got it. Oliver takes the shovel from Walter and almost drops it.\nOliver: Whoa! Ow!\nWoman: He must be drunk.\nOliver (whispering): I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I got it. I got it. Oliver leans into the microphone.\nOliver: Some of you may not know me. My name is Oliver Queen. Watch some television, read a newspaper, I'm kind of famous right now. Mostly, though, I'm famous because I'm Robert Queen's son. Uh, but as Walter, who's my new dad... Huh? Who is... Sorry. As Walter was saying, I'm not much of a legacy, per se.\nWalter: Oliver, you don't have to do this.\nOliver: No, sit. Sit! Gosh. See, I was supposed to come here today, and I'm supposed to take my rightful place at the company. Prodigal son returns home and becomes the heir apparent. But I'm not my father. I'm not the man he was. I'm not half the man he was. I never will be. So, please, stop asking me to be. Oliver sticks shovel into dirt and walks off stage. Thea watches in shock and Moira puts her head down. Diggle follows Oliver away.\n(CAMERAS CONTINUE CLICKING)\nINT. LAW FIRM - DAY\nLaurel, Emily Nocenti, and Lawyer watch the news report.\nNewscaster: Martin Somers, the CEO of Starling Port, was arrested last night for the murder of Victor Nocenti. He is also being accused of accepting cash, including over $10 million in bribes. Lawyer turns off TV.\nLawyer: Well, we can pursue the civil suit if you want, but the D.A. now has no choice, with Mr. Somers' confession, to prosecute him.\nLaurel: He's going to jail, Emily. For the rest of his life.\nEmily Nocenti: Thank you so much for fighting for us.\nLaurel: Well, thank you for being brave enough to let me. Emily Nocenti walks away and Quentin enters.\nQuentin: Hey.\nLaurel: I thought I didn't need police protection anymore.\nQuentin: I thought I didn't need a reason to see my own daughter.\nLaurel: You don't. Hmm. You look tired.\nQuentin: Yeah, I was filling out reports on the shootout at the port last night and getting grilled about how I let that archer get away.\nLaurel: I have to admit, I'm kind of glad he did. He brought down Martin Somers.\nQuentin: He hurt a bunch of people doing it, okay? He is no hero. He is an anarchist.\nLaurel: Yeah, well, whoever he is, it seems like he's trying to help.\nQuentin: The city doesn't need that kind of help, okay? It's like I always told you, you don't need to go outside the law to find justice. Now I believe that. All right? And I promise you, when I catch this guy, (voiceover) he's gonna believe it, too.\nINT. QUEEN MANSION - DAY\nOliver sits at his desk with his father's book. He crosses off \"Martin Somers.\"\nFLASHBACK\nOliver carries his dad's body over rocks.\n(PANTING)\n(GROANS)\nHe lays his dad's body on the ground and sees the book in his dad's pocket. He opens the book to see blank pages, aside from a circular design on the inside of the front cover.\nEND FLASHBACK\nEXT. BRIDGE - DAY\nA limo pulls up next to a silver car. Moira gets out of the car and into the limo.\nMoira: Well, you saw for yourself. My son knows nothing. Robert didn't tell him anything that could hurt us. And he has no idea that the yacht was sabotaged. Camera shows the other person holding a book with the same circular design.\nEXT. QUEEN MANSION - DAY\nOliver looking at gravestones with two workers behind him and Diggle standing by the car. Oliver kneels in front of his father's stone with the book in hand.\nOliver: All that time on the island, plotting my return, I didn't realize how hard it would be. To reconnect with Mom, Thea, Laurel. Okay, I didn't... I didn't know how painful it would be to keep my secrets. You asked me to save the city. To right your wrongs. I will. I swear. But to do that, I can't be the Oliver that everyone wants me to be, which means that sometimes... To honor your wishes... I need to dishonor your memory. I'm sorry. Oliver stands and sighs, walking toward the car.\nOliver: Take it down. The workers walk toward the gravestones.\nDiggle: Will you be going out tonight, sir?\nOliver: Definitely.\nFLASHBACK\nOliver picks up a rock and puts it on the grave he made for his father.\n(ARROW THUDS)\nA handmade arrow goes through Oliver's right shoulder.\n(SCREAMING)\n(GROANING LOUDLY)\nOliver looks around and sees someone in a green hood standing on the rocks by the water.

        "logit_0": "  The text is a summary of the events that occurred in the episode \"The Candidate\" of the television series Arrow. In the episode, Oliver Queen (played by Stephen Amell) is running for mayor of Starling City and is being pressured by his mother, Moira (played by Susanna Thompson), to keep his identity as the vigilante known as the Arrow a secret. However, Oliver's father, Robert Queen (played by Paul Blackthorne), was killed by a man named Martin Somers, who was a member of a group called the League of Assassins. Oliver is determined to find Somers and bring him to justice, but his mother and his best friend, John Diggle (played by David Ramsey), are concerned that Oliver's actions as the Arrow could jeopardize his campaign. In the episode, Oliver is confronted by Somers, who reveals that he is responsible for sabotaging the Queen family yacht and killing Robert Queen. Oliver is forced to choose between his identity as the Arrow and his campaign for mayor. In the end, Oliver decides to keep his identity as the Arrow a secret and to honor his father's memory by bringing Somers to justice.</s>The invention provides a method for preparing a high-purity nano"

Did you send them?\nAngela: They arrived this morning.\nKevin: Are you sure? It is a big deal.\nAngela: Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?\nKevin: ... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAngela: Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk]\nDwight: Everything is fine. You are in the clear.\nAngela: Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.\nAndy: Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?\nMichael: Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.\nAndy: Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know.

Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.\nStanley: Pass.\nMichael: You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.\nStanley: ... I'll take the kid.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRyan: I am very flattered. I was his second choice after \"Pass.\"\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.\nDwight: Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?\nJim: Yup. I'll trade.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.\nMichael: Dwight?\nDwight: Yup?\nMichael: Here ya go. [throws laundry]\nDwight: Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?\nMichael: Please.\nAndy: He does your laundry?\nMichael: Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the \"Amazing Race.\" [To Ryan and Stanley] And you guys are the retired marines. [To Phyllis and Karen] And you guys are the mother and daughter. [To Dwight and Jim] And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?\nKaren: Wait, \"Amazing Race\" like, the biggest sale wins?\nMichael: No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.\nRyan: Is there a prize?\nMichael: Just bragging rights.\nPhyllis: Then how is this \"Amazing Race\"?\nMichael: It's just... brrrrrr... It's \"Amazing Race,\" Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.\nDwight: Come on!!\nPhyllis: Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]\nMichael: Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!\nAndy: Bueno.\nPhyllis: Do you have a pole?\nKaren: Let's go get a broom.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?\nDwight: Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Here we go.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?\nMichael: Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.\nAndy: Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAngela: Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?\nPam: Really?\nAngela: Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.\nPam: Ok. Sure.\nAngela: Ok.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKaren: Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?\nPhyllis: Um-hmmm.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRyan: Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?\nStanley: You want the lead?\nRyan: Yeah, if you don't mind.\nStanley: Mind? Nothing would delight me more.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: Leave the keys.\nJim: You still do that thing?\nDwight: Leave the keys!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?\nMichael: Hawkman.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.\nMichael: [Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: After you sir.\nDwight: No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.\nJim: Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.\nDwight: Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPam: Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.\nAngela: This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.\nPam: That's great.\nAngela: Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?\nBuyer: Yep.\nMichael: You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.\nAndy: Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.\nMichael: You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.\nAndy: Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.\nBuyer: Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past.\nMichael: I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.\nAndy: Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.\nMichael: No.\nAndy: I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.\nMichael: Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy's shoulder] Stop it.\nAndy: Ow.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Newpeat Quote ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: Oh man. Talk about your classic \"Lame dash O.\" Do we even want that guy buying our paper?\nMichael: Yes.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.\nMichael: Ah, no. Don't worry about it.\nAndy: I really 'Schruted' it.\nMichael: What?\nAndy: 'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?\nMichael: I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPhyllis: It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.\nKaren: Yeah, thank you.\nPhyllis: Hey, how's Annie?\nKenny: Oh, she's great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJulius: Stanley Hudson.\nStanley: Ah, Julius, how's it goin'?\nJulius: Great, great, great.\nGuy: Stanley.\nStanley: So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.\nRyan: Hi.\nStanley: I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?\nRyan: Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.\nJulius: Hello, Ryan. What do you have for us?\nRyan: Oh...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.\nMan: 'Kay. 'Kay.\nDwight: Can I use your phone?\nMan: Yeah, sure, go ahead.\nDwight: Thanks.\nJim: Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.\nDwight: [On Phone] One...\nJim: We have discount prices on ink cartridges...\nDwight: Three...\nJim: And, also, any forms that you are going to need...\nDwight: Seven...\nJim: We can custom make them.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Newpeat Quote ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPam: Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Newpeat Quote ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPam: Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.\nKevin: How much did you win?\nPam: $100.\nKevin: I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.\nPam: Cool. Congratulations.\nKevin: Thanks, so sweet.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nStanley: Ha ha ha! And you just said, \"Hi! Hi! Hi!\" Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMan: We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys.\nDwight: Sure.\nJim: Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?\nMan: It's very.\nPhone: Please keep holding, your call is very important to us.\nDwight: Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.\nJim: [Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin.\nKelly: Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly.\nJim: Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.\nKelly: Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]\nDwight: Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.\nMan: All right, I get it. We got a deal.\nJim: Thanks.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Newpeat Quote ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPam: Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.\nAngela: That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.\nPam: Oh.\nAngela: I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.\nPam: Oh?\nAngela: Mmm-hmm.\nPam: Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.\nAngela: Well then. Have a nice day.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKaren: Thanks. That was fun.\nPhyllis: Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.\nKaren: Thank you.\nPhyllis: I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.\nKaren: That's nice.\nPhyllis: You can pay me back later for the makeover.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: Hey boss. Got a minute?\nMichael: Yes, Andy.\nAndy: I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?\nMichael: He didn't say.\nAndy: That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?\nMichael: No, you are remembering it wrong.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.\nJim: Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.\nDwight: My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.\nJim: We should go on a double date.\nDwight: No thank you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJan: Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote \"Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.\"\nMichael: I knew it. [Dwight and Jim walk in]\nAndy: Oh, doggie.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKaren: Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?\nJim: Sure. Look at you!\nKaren: Yeah.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Newpeat Quote ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: Beesley, coffee?\nPam: No, thanks. I had some already.\nJim: All right.\nPam: Oh, but, hey, Jim.\nJim: Yeah.\nPam: I won an art contest today.\nJim: No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]\nPam: Thanks.\nJim: Which one was it?\nPam: I sent in one of my watercolors.\nJim: Cool.\nPam: It was the new one I did.\nJim: Oh\nKaren: You ready Jim?\nJim: Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?\nPam: Yeah.\nJim: Congratulations.\nPam: Thanks.\nJim: Big deal.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: Hey, we nailed the sale!\nMichael: Where were you this morning?\nDwight: I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.\nMichael: Why do you lie, liar?\nDwight: I am not a liar.\nMichael: You are lying right now.\nAndy: It sure seems like he is lying.\nDwight: Stay out of this, you!\nMichael: I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.\nDwight: Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.\nMichael: Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.\nDwight: That's what she said.\nMichael: Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: It's going to be ok.\nAngela: How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.\nDwight: That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.\nAngela: I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.\nDwight: Well, I don't have a lot of choices.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKaren: So, let me ask you a question.\nJim: Ok.\nKaren: Did you ever have a thing for Pam?\nJim: Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?\nKaren: I moved here from Connecticut...\nJim: Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?\nKaren: 'Kay.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome. Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy? No, he was not. He was a total douche. Doompity-doomp.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.\nMichael: Good luck.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRyan: Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAngela: Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: Hey man.

        "prompt_0": "Narrator: America's top ghost hunters relive their most extreme assignments.\n(Woman screams)\nThis house is beyond haunted.\nNarrator: Hardened veterans of the paranormal, these are the cases that truly tested them. There was a evil presence in that house.\nWoman: Oh (bleep) what the hell?\nMan: Dude, I got goose bumps. It's in here.\nNarrator: In Colorado, a ghost causes havoc at a restaurant before turning its fury at the owner. We felt genuinely physically threatened.\n(Screams)\nNarrator: In Massachusetts, an investigator is forced to confront his own worst fear.\nIt was a horrific nightmare.\n(Woman screaming)\nNarrator: And in the great lakes, an imaginary friend turns out to be something much more sinister...\nLuke? ...And puts a boy in grave danger. Nothing is sacred. That's scary.\nNarrator: Some 30 miles northeast of Denver, Colorado, lies the small town of fort Lupton. One of the town's most popular restaurants is wholly Stromboli, the passion project of owner Melissa Rickman. Wholly Stromboli's been a dream of mine since I was about 20. Just for years, it's all I could think about. I daydreamed about it. So when I got laid off from corporate America, my husband said, \"well, why don't you do it?\"\nNarrator: The restaurant opens in 2010, and not long afterwards, mysterious and confusing things start to occur. I would walk in for the morning, set down my coffee, turn off the alarm. Come back, and my coffee was gone. And I thought, \"oh, I left it in the car.\" Then, go out, and it's not in the car, so come back, and... There's the coffee. Wow. Okay. There's no logical explanation for that. There's -- there's none.\nNarrator: The activity soon intensifies. Thank you so much.\n(Child giggles)\nOh, my god! An apparition of a little girl starts appearing in the restaurant. I hadn't had any experience prior to this with ghosts, but it's not my imagination. No, no, no, no, no.\n(Child giggling)\nNarrator: And soon, there would be no doubts.\nRickman: I walked into the kitchen to talk to the sauté chef, and every pan comes just flying off the shelf.\n(Woman screams)\nAnd with such force. It was just foom! -- right on the floor. Oh, my god! Like, \"holy cow.\" The chef, she was terrified.\n(Women screaming)\nIt's scary.\nNarrator: Fearing for the safety of her staff and customers, Melissa contacts a group of paranormal investigators.\nEstep: Melissa called me out of her mind with worry. She wanted to get to the bottom of some of the activity that was going on there. She wanted to be able to tell her staff that they had no reason to be afraid.\nNarrator: Richard Estep has spent over 20 years researching claims of ghostly activity.\nEstep: I've learned that 90% of claims of the paranormal have no grounding, so it's very easy to say that you don't believe in ghosts and you may never encounter one. But at some point in your life, statistically, there's a chance that you will, and at that point, it's going to make you change your entire world view.\nNarrator: Melissa's experiences convince Richard to look into her case.\nEstep: I was satisfied that there was enough evidence there to merit us going on site at wholly Stromboli. Something clearly is going on.\nNarrator: First, Richard looks into the history of the property that houses the restaurant.\nEstep: The building was built in the early 1900s and owned by a local businessman named Edgar St. John.\n(Girl coughing)\nAnd he had a daughter named Julia who tragically is said to have died at the age of 7 of pneumonia.\n(Coughing continues)\nNarrator: Could this be the little girl that haunts the dining room and is responsible for all the activity in the restaurant?\nRichard assembles his team and heads to fort Lupton to find out.\nEstep: Most of the activity, it's in the basement, which is where the voices have been heard. And that's where I want to direct my investigation. The sounds, the echoes, and the acoustics are very, very creepy and spooky. Even I am starting to feel that there is an oppressive atmosphere down in this basement. Melissa is the focus of a lot of the activity here, so we wanted Melissa with us.\nNarrator: Also present is Richard's co-investigator, Robbin Daidone. I've been a paranormal investigator almost 18 years, so I've had a lot of experience. Pretty seasoned. I don't think there's much I haven't seen. There was definitely a sense when we started the investigation that there was something present, perhaps. There was a feeling of being watched.\n(Girl laughing)\nNarrator: They don't have to wait long before their feelings are vindicated.\n(Girl laughing)\nEstep: The voice of a young girl is heard.\nThis is a voice that's laughing out of the darkness.\n(Girl laughing)\nOh, my god. And then we started to see equipment after equipment fail. We have EMF meters, thermometers, Geiger counter failing. We had several sets of cameras fail. Batteries were reading dead. And this is classic in the paranormal field. One set of batteries fails? oh, that's a shame. Twice? huh. That's kind of odd. Three times? There is something in here that is taking this juice and is using it for its own purposes. I was a little on edge. Melissa looked a little nervous. There was definitely a feeling in the air like this may be a time for something to occur.\nNarrator: Gaining an energy, the activity intensifies to become physical. Something just touched me. I saw that! I saw her hood get tugged. It was like physically somebody tugged her hoodie, but, you know, there was nobody there. Something just pulled my jacket! Something just pulled me. That sent a different kind of chill through the investigative team. So now you start looking out of the corner of your eye, you start looking at every shadow with a renewed level of suspicion.\n(Tapping)\nWe hear the sound of footsteps on the floor above, which would be the restaurant floor, coming down through our ceiling in the basement.\n(Tapping)\n(Tapping continues)\nThey're childlike footsteps running across the floor.\nNarrator: Richard leads the team upstairs, hoping to catch a glimpse of the little-girl ghost, Julia. But when they arrive, they're shocked by what they see.\nEstep: This is a solid shadow figure. I've heard about them all my career. I'm seeing it. It's incredible. Genuinely taken aback. Suddenly, I see this shadow figure. I'm stunned.\nRickman: Disbelief. Disbelief and \"oh, my gosh. I can't believe we just saw that.\"\nNarrator: The encounter forces Richard into a troubling realization. The ghost of Julia is not the only entity haunting the restaurant. Who knows what it is, and who knows what its intentions are?\nNarrator: Believing the shadow has moved to the basement, the team heads back downstairs.\nRickman: Immediately, people were a little bit apprehensive. There's definitely a creep factor.\nEstep: We start asking questions, very respectfully, \"we invite any spirit that might be present to make its presence known, to talk with us.\" If there's someone here, please present yourself. Who are you?! Are you attached to Melissa?!\nNarrator: The entity doesn't want to talk. It has other, more sinister plans. I started to feel pressure in my chest, just like heavy, weighted down. Oh, god. Oh, my god.\n(Groans)\nNarrator: In a haunted restaurant in Colorado...\nSomething just pulled my jacket! ...Paranormal investigator Richard Estep and his team have encountered an entity in the basement. Oh, god. Now owner Melissa Rickman is overwhelmed by a sinister force. I started to feel pressure in my chest, just like heavy, weighted down. Oh, god. Um, and I can't really explain why, but suddenly, I began to cry, sobbing, just sobbing uncontrollably, just the most sad feeling I've ever had.\n(Crying)\nDaidone: I was mostly concerned for her emotional well-being.\nI could see that she was emotionally frayed. She was just one big bundle of nerves.\n(Sobbing)\nAnd then that emotion transformed into anger. And suddenly, Melissa is getting very, very aggressive.\n(Growling)\nMelissa becomes someone else. (Breathing heavily) Melissa! During that time, I felt truly angry. I was -- I was pissed, and I couldn't -- I couldn't tell you why. And every time she said something, I retorted, although I didn't feel like it was me.\nEstep: So, as a paramedic for 14 years in emergency medical services, I've seen a number of psychotic episodes. This wasn't that. This was something that presented very, very differently and had a very different vibe to it. You shut up, you (bleep) (bleep)\n(Growls)\nI was feeling threatened. It wasn't like I was choosing to say things. It just felt like they were just coming out of my mouth. And I felt horrible. I said some things to her that I would never say. I was terrified. I was really scared.\nNarrator: Richard is beginning to fear that Melissa is becoming possessed. We know that it's not Melissa herself that's doing this. We know that there is something that is goading her on, that is provoking her to this type of behavior. It felt like all of the emotion in my body just welled up and exploded. And then I heard Robbin say, \"her fists are clenched.\" She's saying, \"I want to hurt you, and I want to hurt you bad.\" And, of course, I'm becoming concerned. I'm watching her for any sudden movement. She's only a foot or two away from me. I am gonna kill you! And Melissa was getting ready to attack.\n(Melissa screaming)\nIt's completely unpredictable. It's completely out of character, and that adds an element of danger to our investigation, and we had to very quickly break that up.\n(Screaming)\nThis is the first case my team has worked on where we felt genuinely physically threatened by somebody present on the scene. Very concerning, absolutely. Absolutely. So, we actually decide that we're going to wrap up the investigation earlier than we ordinarily would and help coax her back to normal.\nNarrator: As soon as she leaves the basement, Melissa is released from the entity's grasp. I don't remember saying half the things I said. I don't. I would've told you that that wasn't me. When words are just flying out of your mouth and you don't know why, it's pretty unnerving. My assessment of wholly Stromboli is that they have multiple entities there. We have one that appears to be a little girl. We have this older male shadow figure. It's difficult to tell what the purpose is of whatever is haunting the restaurant. Is it simply seeking attention, or is there something darker and more sinister?\nNarrator: To protect her from further attacks, they perform a blessing on Melissa. Out! out, demon! Begone! Whatever possessed her seems to have been removed. But the spirit of the little girl remains. Our line cooks still hear a little girl either giggling and playing or crying in the basement.\n(Girl giggling)\nI don't mind sharing the space with the tenants of the past. The building wouldn't be there if it weren't for them, so if they want to hang out, I'm all right with that.\nNarrator: But Richard worries that the negative entity may yet return. Right now I'm content to just monitor and watch and wait for Melissa to call me if things should take a turn for the worse again. I'm not entirely sure yet, but I do know that the last chapter in the story of the wholly Stromboli haunting has not yet been written.\nNarrator: Coming up, when a child's imaginary friend turns out to be something much more sinister...\n(Boy screaming)\n...An investigator has to call in backup to save the boy. It was definitely demon-induced.\n(Speaking in tongues)\nNarrator: But first, when a young family is tormented by paranormal activity, one investigator is forced to confront his worst fears.\nSomething was gonna grab me.\n(Woman screaming)\nNarrator: The historic town of Medway, Massachusetts, is home to Greg and Lyla Pierson.\nTheir lives should be full of joy and happiness after celebrating the birth of their first child. But recently, troubling things have started to happen.\n(Baby crying)\nThey hear a child's voice coming through the baby monitor when their child is with them. When the Piersons go to investigate... The baby's room is completely empty.\n(Baby crying)\nAfter establishing that they're not just picking up interference from a neighbor's baby monitor, they start to worry their child could be in danger and contact a paranormal investigator. Joe Cetrone is the founder of dark hauntings research and has been investigating the supernatural for over 15 years. He knows firsthand what it's like to be haunted by a child's spirit.\nCetrone: I recall when I was younger, was laying in my bed, a child ghost came up to my bed and just kind of walked toward me, and it just stared at me. Its face was pale. Eyes were black.\n(Child screams)\nAfter that, I was never the same, and ever since then, I've had a phobia of child spirits.\n(Child screaming)\nSo when I received the e-mail from the Pierson family, it immediately sends a shiver through me.\nNarrator: If Joe agrees to help the Piersons, he will have to face his greatest fear.\nCetrone: I don't want to know that if I refuse the case, maybe that child is gonna go on being terrorized by something. I know how that feels.\n(Child screams)\nIt, uh -- it was gonna be an experience for me, but I was willing to take that chance.\nNarrator: Joe heads to Medway to begin the investigation.\nCetrone: When I first arrived, everything appeared to be normal from the outside. Now the question was, what was happening inside?\n(Baby crying)\n(Knock on door)\nI first walked in the house. Everything was fine. Nothing unusual. I didn't feel anything. But at that point, I figured it was best to just proceed with an assessment and a walk-through. Ended up in the child's room. It was a regular, normal room -- Stuffed animals, toys, crib, everything in place. I wasn't sensing anything at all.\nNarrator: Joe begins to think there's a more rational cause for the strange activity.\nCetrone: There's many explanations as to a voice coming over a baby monitor, picking up different frequencies everywhere. Checked it, see if there was any short in the wire or something to just give me an indication that maybe there's a plausible reason why a voice is coming through that monitor, but I couldn't find anything.\nNarrator: Relieved he hasn't an encountered a child spirit, Joe tells the family he can find no trace of anything paranormal in the house. But that's when things changed.\n(Tapping)\nNarrator: In Massachusetts, a young family is being tormented by a child spirit.\nInvestigator Joe Cetrone has agreed to help, despite his own fears. I've had a phobia of child spirits.\nNarrator: Now the activity has escalated.\n(Tapping)\nCetrone: Out of nowhere, I hear this sound of something walking upstairs.\n(Tapping)\nAnd it sounded like little feet walking across. Really quick. We all looked up. I was like, \"did you hear that?\" I was totally, like, \"what is going on here?\"\n(Tapping continues)\nThen I hear a sound coming out of the baby monitor.\n(Child talking)\nWe heard a child speaking through the baby monitor. But the only thing, it was -- it wasn't their child. I see the light... And I just see it turn off. Something turned that baby monitor off. I knew there was something happening. It definitely was creepy. It struck me and -- and brought me that fear. Took me back to when I was younger.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBoy: No! not again! It just made my skin crawl. I'm battling two things -- The fact that this family is dealing with something coming over that monitor. Simultaneously, I'm also dealing with my fears, just the fact that it might a child spirit.\nBoy: No! not again!\nNarrator: Forced to confront his own demons, Joe is rocked to the very core. But he refuses to abandon the Piersons and calls for immediate backup.\nCetrone: At that point, I had my investigator come to the case with me. He said could I come down. Right away I could sense fear in his voice. There's something that he doesn't want to deal with alone.\nNarrator: Steve sets up his camera in the baby's room. As I was filming the room, I sensed that darkness, that -- that feeling of something's going on, and I could feel something electric in the room.\nNarrator: While Steve is upstairs, Joe heads into the basement.\nCetrone: I set the camera up, turned it on. And that's when I felt a sense that there was something there.\n(Tapping)\nI hear the footsteps going across. I started feeling that something was gonna grab me. I don't know if it was just because of my phobias. I just kept seeing a child's face. Just that frightening image. I was scared. I felt it was playing tricks with me, a game of hide-and-seek. And at that point, I knew that it was following me. That fear escalated. That was, like, the first time that I got spooked by something I couldn't see or verify.\n(Child screams)\n(Breathing heavily)\nI knew it was getting to me. I was afraid of it.\nNarrator: Rattled, Joe radios Steve for help. I heard Joe yell my name, \"Steve, come here!\" And I felt that urgency. I could hear it in his voice. All right. Be there in a second.\nNarrator: Almost immediately, the spirit focuses its attention on Steve. Right when I turned to go walk towards the stairs, I had the chills.\nNarrator: On a case in Massachusetts, investigator Joe Cetrone is being tormented by his own deepest fear, a child spirit. I felt it was playing tricks with me.\nNarrator: Now the entity is turning its focus on fellow investigator Steve pate.\nPate: As I started heading towards Joe, there was a stuffed animal, a giraffe. But I didn't think anything of it. Right when I turned to go walk towards the stairs... It came flying right at me. It flew off the shelf, hit my head. I had the chills. I could feel it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nI've watched a million horror movies, but that, to happen to you in real life, it's freaky. That was it. It freaked me right out.\nNarrator: Worried about provoking the spirit further, Joe and Steve leave the house to figure out what they're dealing with and how to get rid of it.\nCetrone: I reviewed all the evidence that we possibly could. There were no orbs, there were no EVPS, there was nothing strange. Other than what had happened to us while we were there and in real-time, there was no evidence that I can gather.\nNarrator: When Joe returns the next day, Lyla Pierson has some chilling news.\n(Baby crying)\nShe's spoken with a neighbor who told her that a young boy who lived in the house years ago tragically drowned.\nCetrone: Based upon my research, if a child died prematurely or a tragic accident happened, sometimes that energy, that residual, leftover energy, that child may not be ready to move on.\n(Baby crying)\nA lot of time, they'll cling to their home, they'll cling to something that resembled its family, whether it was a mom or another child. And I started to realize, that spirit of that boy was there to watch over that child, to be part of a family. I think the child spirit wanted to stay in the house. It's like with the stuffed animal. The child didn't want me to lea-- Was letting me know he wanted to be part of that family.\nNarrator: Joe offers to cleanse the house, but Lyla refuses.\nCetrone: She had sympathy. Her whole thoughts of it being threatening or anything dangerous to herself or her child just went away, and she says, \"you know, I'm okay. I feel validated by everything.\"\nNarrator: She sees the spirit not as a threat but as a guardian angel watching over her child. She was welcoming it in, and she was okay with it.\nNarrator: The experience also has a profound effect on Joe. I think, for me, it did bring a little healing. I was always fearful of child spirits, but not every situation that comes up is always evil in nature or negative. And when a child-spirit case comes up again, at least I know I can go into it in a different way and not have those fears that I had. Yeah, it did that for me.\nNarrator: Imaginary friends are usually an innocent part of growing up. But sometimes they turn out to be something else, something evil that can threaten to take over the child completely. The quiet suburban neighborhood of Burlington, Ontario. It should be an idyllic place to grow up. But in one house, Karen Baines has become worried about her son.\nLuke: No! Luke? I didn't do that.\n(Speaking indistinctly)\nLuke, who are you talking to? It begins when Luke becomes obsessed with a mysterious imaginary friend that he refuses to talk about. In the basement, the family starts hearing strange footsteps and whispering voices.\n(Door creaking)\nThen Luke is beset by terrifying nightmares.\nLuke: Mom! What's wrong? My door's doing it. He says there's something evil out to get him. Luke? Luke? Desperate and terrified for the safety of her child, Karen reaches out to a paranormal investigator. She was panicked, she was anxious, and she wanted us in as soon as we could get there.\nNarrator: Michelle Desrochers has been actively investigating ghosts since 2004. A founding member of Canada's most haunted, Michelle is a veteran of over 50 cases. What I've learned about the paranormal is that things are never what they seem to be. You never really know what you're getting yourself into.\nNarrator: Michelle needs no persuasion to take on this investigation.\nDesrochers: This case was very personal to me. This was home base. This happened in my city of Burlington, literally one major street away from me.\nNarrator: As soon as Michelle enters the house, she senses evil.\nDesrochers: I felt something's not right. I felt anxious. Everything in my fiber was telling me that there was something a lot more malevolent in that house than just an everyday imaginary friend.\nNarrator: When a young boy gets a mysterious imaginary friend, strange and terrifying things start to happen. As soon as she gets to the house, investigator Michelle Desrochers is struck by a terrible feeling. There was something a lot more malevolent in that house than just an everyday imaginary friend or spirit.\nNarrator: As they tour the house, Karen tells Michelle something that makes her blood run cold.\nDesrochers: She said, \"I hear popping sounds.\" Then it sounded like something was being -- Like someone took a piece of paper and went krkk! -- Ripped it behind me.\n(Ripping)\nThere's a belief that demons tend to tear through the atmosphere... As they come into our dimension.\nNarrator: Michelle suspects these strange events are connected to Luke's imaginary friend.\nDesrochers: Children are the weakest link, so if something comes in, they're usually the ones that get targeted. So I says, \"I understand you have a friend.\" And he said, \"yes. He can change into a dinosaur.\" I'm like, \"oh.\" It's definitely not common to hear about imaginary friends shape-shifting. That is a red flag for me.\nNarrator: Michelle asks how the friend came to be here. He goes, \"well, I said he could come and play.\" There's the one answer I was waiting for -- The invitation. A demonic infestation will 90% of the time start with some kind of an invitation, and this boy made the invitation.\nNarrator: To have any chance of removing the entity, Michelle must revoke the invitation. She tells Luke his mother doesn't want his friend to visit anymore. He turned around and said, \"you go home! You cannot stay here.\" I couldn't have asked for it to go better. Awesome, buddy. The invite has been revoked.\nNarrator: But just because the demon's been told it's not welcome doesn't mean it's going to go quietly.\nDesrochers: I was hugely concerned for the safety of this little boy and of this family.\nNarrator: Michelle heads to the basement. She sets up recording equipment to see if she can capture the sounds the family heard. In the meantime, Michelle calls in extra help.\nDesrochers: I brought one of my researchers along with me and one of our mediums.\nNarrator: Michelle leads them to Luke's bedroom. And activity started almost immediately. The psychic started picking up on different things going on, and he clearly said, \"something comes out of that closet.\" The door, it just started -- it would just shake.\nNarrator: Then a drawer suddenly shoots out and strikes the researcher. Well, something is definitely trying to tell me something. Aah! Well, this is unusual. Let's get out of here.\nNarrator: While the team explores the rest of the house, Michelle heads back to the basement. All of a sudden, I've got a cold spot behind me. It started to intensify. It got colder. And I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable, 'cause I realize I'm not alone. I'm not alone. I hear a very low growl. At that point, I realized somebody's trying to frighten me off, and that's not gonna work. Undeterred, Michelle checks on the tape recorder. What she hears stop her cold. What I found was completely unexpected.\nNarrator: Investigator Michelle Desrochers and her team are doing battle with a demon that's trying to take over a young boy.\nDesrochers: I was hugely concerned for the safety of this little boy.\nNarrator: When Michelle checks her tape recorder in the basement, she's stunned by what she's captured.\n(Tape recorder rewinds)\nPhantom sounds.\nNarrator: Phantom sounds have no identifiable cause. I'm hearing something pick up my recorder. You could hear it fumbling with it. How would it know to go after that? It shows a degree of intelligence. I'm hearing something going up wooden stairs, walking around on old hardwood floors. There's no hardwood floors anywhere in the basement. You could hear chains being dragged across the wooden floor. Heard grunting with it, like --\n(Growling)\nSome of the most amazing recordings that I've captured to date.\nNarrator: The evidence confirms Michelle's suspicion that a demon is present. Knowing the family could be in grave danger, she moves quickly to remove it. I ask our medium to do a cleansing. He had a seashell and a feather, he took dried sage leaves, and he proceeded.\n(Speaking in foreign language)\nAnd he basically said, \"I'm asking you to leave.\"\n(Speaking in foreign language)\nNarrator: The cleanse appears to work, and the house goes quiet.\nBut the peace doesn't last long. Three days later, Karen and her family endure their most terrifying experience yet. She called me, she said, \"something is wrong with my son. He's not moving.\" I said, \"call an ambulance.\" Luke! \"I will babysit your kids so you can get your kid to the hospital.\"\nNarrator: Michelle gets to the house before paramedics can arrive. I race up to the bedroom. (Crying) He's not moving.\nDesrochers: I felt an energy. I absolutely felt a strong energy. Let go of this boy and leave this house. It was definitely demon-induced. I'm fighting with this thing, telling it, \"you better let go.\" Get out of this house! \"I'm done with this. You're not doing this anymore.\"\nNarrator: After an epic battle, the demon vanishes.\nDesrochers: He opened his eyes, he looked at me, and he said, \"hi, Michelle. What are you doing here?\" What are you doing here, Michelle? He sat up, gave me the biggest hug. He goes, \"I need to go back to sleep now.\" I went, \"all right.\" I knew, with every fiber of my being, it was definitely demon-induced. Period.\nNarrator: Worried the entity will return yet again, Michelle brings in a renowned demonologist to perform an exorcism on the house. We will not fear the terror, nor pestilence that stalks... She did what she called speaking in tongues, which, from what I understand, is a form of prayer, their version of an exorcism.\n(Speaking in tongues)\nShe said, \"I'm picking up activity over here.\"\n(Speaking in tongues)\nShe went through the entire house banishing that demon.\n(Speaking in tongues)\nNarrator: It takes hours to complete the cleanse.\nBut eventually, it's over.\nDesrochers: She got it. I mean, banished it. This thing was gone, and that house was quiet. And the next time I saw that little boy, he was just a happy-go-lucky kid. Just happy.\n(Sighs)\nNarrator: The boy soon puts the demonic encounter behind him, but it has a lasting effect on Michelle.\nThese things are predators. It made me realize that nothing is sacred. You're not safe. You're not safe. That's scary.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Hey.\nDwight: Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.\nMichael: [gestures to 'Bed & Breakfast' magazine] Is this good?\nDwight: They have some great kitchen ideas.\nMichael: Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?\nDwight: It's small, I know.\nMichael: I really appreciate it.\nDwight: Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?\nMichael: It's for your trouble.\nDwight: Wh- I don't need $6 to help a friend.\nMichael: No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.\nDwight: Michael, you know I can't take this.\nMichael: Yes, I do.\nDwight: But don't forget you owe me $10.\nMichael: That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?\nDwight: Michael.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?\nJim: I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.\nAndy: It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.\nJim: Am I going down a road?\nAndy: When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.\nJim: It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: I know a few things about love. Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.\nPam: I'm not gonna do that.\nMichael: That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?\nRyan: I can get there.\nMichael: Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.\nRyan: Oh, awesome.\nMichael: Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat]\nMichael, Pam & Ryan: U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPam: I'm here. I'm a part of this now.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: You needed to speak to me?\nCharles: Dwight, take a seat.\nDwight: I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.\nCharles: Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?\nDwight: Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.\nCharles: I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.\nDwight: Your concern is noted.\nCharles: Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.\nDwight: Like a wolf. Thank you.\nCharles: And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?\nDwight: Really?\nCharles: Definitely.\nDwight: [sighs] It's firm.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: [on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.\nDwight: I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.\nMichael: Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?\nDwight: No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.\nMichael: I'm not following you.\nDwight: Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.\nMichael: Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.\nDwight: Good, do you see what I'm saying?\nMichael: Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?\nDwight: No.\nMichael: Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying \"He's talking about you!\"]\nDwight: No.\nMichael: [Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?\nDwight: It is possible that I could be talking about us.\nMichael: Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?\nDwight: It is the situation that we are in now.\nMichael: So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?\nDwight: I'm not a barbarian.\nMichael: Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?\nDwight: I will.\nMichael: Dwight?\nDwight: Yes?\nMichael: Is the cool new guy Charles?\nDwight: I've said too much.\nMichael: Is it Stanley?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-\nAndy: 'Noishe.'\nJim: -I just don't know if I can do it.\nAndy: That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?\nJim: It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.\nAndy: And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for?\nJim: [both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.\nAndy: [fist pound each other] Totally.\nJim: Okay.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?\nDwight: I'm sorry, Michael\nCharles: [Charles comes from around corner] Hi, Michael.\nMichael: Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!\nCharles: No, Mich-Michael.\nMichael: Dwight, run!\nCharles: Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?\nMichael: You be cool.\nCharles: Yes.\nMichael: Just-what's going on?\nCharles: We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.\nMichael: Mm-do... Dwight would not-\nCharles: He did.\nDwight: I did, Michael. I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.\nCharles: Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?\nMichael: I. Understand. Nothing.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: [Michael storms into office] Wow.\nPam: Michael, are you alright?\nMichael: It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.\nPam: Tell us what you're talking about.\nRyan: Yeah.\nMichael: It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.\nPam: We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.\nMichael: I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: Hey, Jim.\nJim: [Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.\nAndy: Bro, I do that all the time.\nJim: Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!\nAndy: Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?\nJim: Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.\nAndy: Well, so what? Your body's a ten.\nJim: Forget it.\nAndy: Jim.\nJim: I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: [on phone] Dwight Schrute.\nMichael: Hello, traitor.\nDwight: I think you have the wrong number, Michael.\nMichael: I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.\nPam: Michael!\nMichael: I'm just getting hardcore with him.\nRyan: Finally.\nMichael: Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: [on phone] Mr. Schofield, please?\nSecretary: He's in a meeting.\nDwight: Dammit! [hangs up]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: [on phone] Is Mr. Schofield there?\nAutomated phone voice: If you'd like to reach an outside line, please dial nine first. [Michael sighs, hangs up phone]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nStanley: So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?\nDwight: I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.\nPhyllis: You sound worried.\nDwight: And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: [on phone] Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. [referencing rolodex card] Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?\nRyan: Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.\nPam: I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.\nMichael: Wow. High score?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market. So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?\nDwight: I would like to arrange a truce.\nMichael: So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?\nDwight: Meet me in our spot in four minutes.\nMichael: No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-\nDwight: Michael.\nMichael: Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.\nDwight: In which direction?\nMichael: Toward the sun.\nDwight: At what time?\nMichael: Noon.\nDwight: That-\nMichael: You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: [looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.\nMichael: Dwight.\nDwight: Michael.\nMichael: I hope you're not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.\nDwight: You were making me do things that were not all right.\nMichael: So you just rat me out? You could have said no.\nDwight: And not come through for you?\nMichael: If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.\nDwight: I want a truce.\nMichael: I do too.\nDwight: Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.\nMichael: Cooper's.\nDwight: I had fish yesterday.\nMichael: Damn it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: [Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?\nDwight: Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.\nMichael: Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.\nDwight: I hit a bear.\nMichael: What?\nDwight: He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?\nMichael: Yeah, sure.\nDwight: Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]\nMichael: Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPam: [Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat.\nRyan: We can spend a couple days there.\nPam: Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!\nMichael: [Michael answers phone] Yeah.\nDwight: Did you enjoy your lunch?\nMichael: Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.\nDwight: No, Michael, you were sabotaged.\nMichael: No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying \"Dwight did it!!\"] You?\nDwight: Me.\nMichael: What about our truce?\nDwight: I broke it.\nMichael: On purpose?\nDwight: Yes.\nMichael: Why?\nDwight: You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!\nMichael: Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.\nDwight: And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!\nMichael: Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] b*st*rd!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: [holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, \"great salesman, better friend.\" [turns card over] \"Tall\" and \"beets.\"\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh? Well, you will find none here.\nMichael: Dwight, do you mind if we talk?\nDwight: Sure. That'd be fine.\nMichael: If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.\nDwight: This is war and that is what happens.\nMichael: Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.\nDwight: Oh, no. No. No. No. No.\nMichael: Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.\nDwight: Michael! Michael!\nMichael: You can hear me, but I can't hear you.\nSecretary: Mr. Schofield's ready to see you now, Mr. Scott.\nMichael: Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.\nDwight: Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!\nMichael: Walking in the door...\nMr. Schofield: Michael, good to see you.\nMichael: Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: [on speakerphone in Dwight's car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.\nMr. Schofield: Really?\nMichael: Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.\nDwight: Are you saying you invented paper?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: [hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay.\nJim: Oh, God.\nAndy: Okay, Tuna.\nKelly: Hey, guys.\nJim: Hey.\nAndy: Hello.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.\nKevin: I guess I could be nicer.\nPhyllis: Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.\nAndy: Oh, really?\nPhyllis: Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: Okay.\nAndy: Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?\nJim: Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.\nAndy: Uh, that's not what was-\nJim: And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?\nDwight: It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]\nSecretary: Uh, hello, Dwight.\nDwight: Spin move.\nSecretary: Oh-\nDwight: Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.\nMr. Schofield: Dwight, I'm in a meeting.\nMichael: That's very rude.\nDwight: I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.\nMr. Schofield: Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-\nDwight: La la la! Continuing. Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!\nMichael: I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...\nDwight: Come on.\nMichael: Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.\nDwight: What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.\nMr. Schofield: Why don't you guys just e-mail me your best offers and we can finish it up that way?\nMichael: That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.\nMr. Schofield: Uh, ok, sure.\nMichael: Good, good, good. I will see you.\nDwight: Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?\nMr. Schofield: Excuse me?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: I color code all my info. I wrote \"gay son\" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means \"Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?\" Most colors mean \"Don't say it.\"\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[muffled speech, Ryan, Michael, and Pam all have mouths stuffed with cheese puffs, Michael answers the phone and talks with mouth full]\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?\nSheldon: I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn't sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.\nPenny: God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?\nSheldon: Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.\nPenny: Okay, here's the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.\nSheldon: Good, good. I'm glad we're still friends.\nPenny: Really?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain.\nPenny: Right.\nSheldon: Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?\nPenny: Everyone.\nSheldon: Harsh terms. But all right, I'll just substitute intercourse.\nPenny: Great.\nSheldon: Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I'll hold that in reserve.\nPenny: So, how you been?\nSheldon: Well, my existence is a continuum, so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period.\nPenny: You're just coitusing with me, aren't you?\nSheldon: Bazinga.\nPenny: Mmm. How's Leonard doing?\nSheldon: He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.\nPenny: I'll pretend I didn't hear it.\nSheldon: I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.\nPenny: Yep.\nSheldon: That's the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that's what the Romans made Jesus eat.\nPenny: Interesting. I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.\nSheldon: I'm hungry now.\nPenny: Oh. Um, okay. Why don't you give me an hour and come over?\nSheldon: Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?\nPenny: I don't have hot dogs.\nSheldon: Oh, it's all right, I do. Oh! You're in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment).\nLeonard: Hey, where you been?\nSheldon: I was talking with Penny.\nHoward: What's wrong with you? You can't hang out with your roommate's ex. That's totally uncool.\nLeonard: No, no, it's fine. I don't care. I'm over it.\nRaj: Yeah, he's over it, that's why he's been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.\nSheldon: Is he making any progress? Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.\nHoward: So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.\nSheldon: Which one picks last?\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Well, usually I'm on the team that picks last. Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you're hungry.\nSheldon: Well, of course I'm hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?\nLeonard: I don't know. Why?\nSheldon: Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard! Credits sequence\nScene: A few moments later.\nHoward: Oh, God, this is good.\nRaj: Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you're going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?\nHoward: Jews don't have hell. We have acid reflux.\nLeonard: Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Certainly. It's not like I have to moderate my food intake because I'm planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!\nLeonard: So, you guys want to do something tonight?\nHoward: Nah, I can't. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.\nLeonard: What about you, Raj?\nRaj: Oh, there it is, now that you don't have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.\nLeonard: I never stopped hanging out with you.\nRaj: Oh, please, we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman.\nHoward: I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.\nSheldon: Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.\nLeonard: You know what? I'll just spend the evening alone.\nRaj: What, suddenly I'm not good enough for you?\nSheldon: Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk.\nLeonard: Since when do you take after-dinner walks?\nHoward: Yeah, since when do you take walks?\nSheldon: I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there's one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye-bye.\nHoward: Hold on. I'll walk down with you.\nSheldon: Oh, that's not necessary. You can go first.\nHoward: Or we could go together.\nSheldon: I can't think of a reason why not.\nHoward: Let's go.\nSheldon: Hold on. Nope, no reason.\nRaj: I've missed you.\nScene: The lobby.\nSheldon: All right, say hello to your mother for me.\nHoward: Okay.\nSheldon: What?\nHoward: You said you were going for a walk.\nSheldon: I didn't say outside.\nHoward: So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?\nSheldon: No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.\nWoman's voice: Here Bubbles. Here boy.\nHoward: Which way are you going?\nSheldon: Which way are you going?\nHoward: I parked my scooter down the block.\nSheldon: I'm going the other way. Bye.\nHoward: Bye. Actually, I'm this way. Do I smell hot dogs?\nSheldon: No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.\nHoward: I definitely smell raw hot dog.\nSheldon: Perhaps you're getting a brain tumour.\nHoward: All right, have a nice walk.\nSheldon: I shall. Have a nice scoot.\nHoward: You might want to stand back. I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here.\nSheldon: Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!\nScene: Penny's apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Long pause, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door.

I want to go out and meet a woman.\nLeonard: So, go.\nRaj: Well, I need a wingman. I don't want to come off like a lonely loser.\nLeonard: And you think my presence will help with that?\nRaj: Well, I do. Next to you, I'll look like a catch.\nLeonard: I'm not going out tonight, Raj.\nRaj: All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?\nLeonard: Very much.\nRaj: Doesn't have to be Asian.\nLeonard: Don't worry. You'll meet a girl someday.\nRaj: No, I won't.\nLeonard: Yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.\nRaj: You really think so?\nLeonard: I do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.\nRaj: But we'll have s*x first, right?\nScene: Penny's apartment.\nSheldon: Mmm, mmm, mmm. That's Eye-talian.\nPenny: So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I'm fine, I don't care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.\nPenny: Well, good.\nSheldon: I'm also pleased to report that he's all cried out over you.\nPenny: He's been crying?\nSheldon: Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn't supposed to mention.\nPenny: Oh, God, I feel terrible.\nSheldon: Do you have a stomach ache, too?\nPenny: No. Why, do you?\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Why did you ask if I had one, too?\nSheldon: Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.\nPenny: All right. So, what's new in your life?\nSheldon: Well, my new shoes are not made for running.\nPenny: Have you been running?\nSheldon: No. It's just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.\nPenny: I'm so glad you like it.\nSheldon: I do. Leonard never cooks for me.\nPenny: Well, maybe that's 'cause Leonard can't cook.\nSheldon: You can't cook and you made me this.\nPenny: Whatever. Ooh, I'm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.\nSheldon: Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Look at this. Do you think she's really doing that or is it PhotoShop?\nLeonard: I'm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.\nRaj: You don't know that. Prison changes people.\nLeonard: Hey, where you been?\nSheldon: I told you, walking.\nLeonard: For an hour and a half?\nSheldon: I got lost.\nLeonard: How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.\nSheldon: Satellites are down. Solar flares.\nRaj: There are no solar flares right now.\nSheldon: Yes, there are.\nRaj: Dude, I'm an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I'd be all up in it.\nSheldon: I'm sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.\nLeonard: What the hell was that about?\nRaj: I don't know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?\nLeonard: Oh, we really need to get you a girl.\nScene: Leonard's bedroom. Leonard is asleep.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh, just come in!\nSheldon: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.\nLeonard: What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Maybe this isn't a good time.\nLeonard: Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.\nSheldon: Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.\nLeonard: What do you want?\nSheldon: You may want to sit down.\nLeonard: I'm in bed!\nSheldon: Point taken. You may want to sit up.\nLeonard: Sheldon!\nSheldon: I've been seeing Penny behind your back.\nLeonard: Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?\nSheldon: We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?\nLeonard: Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?\nSheldon: I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.\nLeonard: Then why did you have Chinese food with us?\nSheldon: I didn't want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.\nLeonard: Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?\nSheldon: Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I don't care if you want to be friends with Penny.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that's been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.\nLeonard: I guess not.\nSheldon: And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Oh, um, I, I can come back.\nLeonard: D-don't be silly. We're neighbours, we're going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.\nPenny: Yeah, I guess you're right.\nLeonard: You used to it yet?\nPenny: Nope.\nLeonard: Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it's fine.\nPenny: Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.\nLeonard: His mother?\nPenny: Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.\nLeonard: I was going to do that.\nPenny: Oh, well, then you, you do it.\nLeonard: No, I don't want to do it. You can do it.\nPenny: Okay, you can take him for shoes.\nLeonard: I just took him for shoes.\nPenny: Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.\nLeonard: Fine. I'll take him for shoes next Saturday.\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.\nLeonard: You're taking him to Disneyland?\nPenny: Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?\nLeonard: All right. But let me know if you're going to stuff him with junk food. I don't want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.\nPenny: We're going to Disneyland. He's going to eat junk food.\nLeonard: All I'm saying is give me a heads-up.\nPenny: Okay, whatever.\nLeonard: And don't let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He'll say he can handle it, but I promise you'll end up with churro puke on your shoes.\nPenny: All right, got it. Is there anything else?\nLeonard: Yeah, don't let Goofy near him. He'll have nightmares and I'll have to deal with it.\nPenny: What's the problem with Goofy?\nLeonard: Wish I knew. He's fine with Pluto.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?\nHoward: Well, that's it. We're officially out of things to talk about.\nPenny: We're home.\nLeonard: It's ten o'clock, where have you been?\nSheldon: We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.\nLeonard: I was going to see that with him.\nPenny: How was I supposed to know that?\nSheldon: It's all right. I'll see it again with you.\nLeonard: And I have food here. You said you were going to call.\nPenny: I know, I know.\nSheldon: I can still eat.\nPenny: No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.\nSheldon: Okay, but just don't fight\nLeonard: We're not fighting.\nPenny: Just go.\nLeonard: Aren't you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?\nSheldon: Thank you, Penny.\nPenny: You're welcome, sweetie.\nLeonard: Want a cup of coffee?\nPenny: Oh, um, I should probably get going.\nLeonard: Come on. It's just a cup of coffee.\nPenny: Yep, okay. Howard (to Raj, who has whispered to him): Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.\nLeonard: What am I smelling?\nPenny: Sheldon's churro on my shoes.\nScene: Sheldon's bedroom.\nPenny: He's such an angel when he's asleep.\nLeonard: Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.\nPenny: I think we can do it.\nLeonard: Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn't that be wrong?\nPenny: No, be friends. You and me.\nLeonard: Oh. Sure. Absolutely.\nPenny: Good. I'm glad.\nLeonard: Here's an idea. I'm just throwing it out there, friends who have s*x.\nPenny: Good night, Leonard.\nLeonard: Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin' around.\nSheldon (in his sleep): No, Goofy, no.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

[tries to turn off the alarm]\nRORY: What's going on? Is it the smoke detector? Are we on fire?\nLORELAI: It's not the smoke detector, it's the alarm!\nRORY: What alarm?\nLORELAI: Our alarm.\nRORY: We don't have an alarm.\nLORELAI: Well, then, we have really angry rats. Did you cut your hair?\nRORY: Well, I just trimmed it.\nLORELAI: You didn't tell me you were cutting your hair.\nRORY: It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.\nLORELAI: A spur-of-the-moment, \"let's not tell my mother I'm pulling a G.I. Jane\"?\nRORY: Are we seriously gonna have this conversation now during the air raid?\nLORELAI: You're right. Come on. [leads her to the other side of the room]\nRORY: What are we doing?\nLORELAI: I figured out that there is a motion detector, and if you stand over here, it can't see you and calms down.\nRORY: Great, so what now?\nLORELAI: We wait. So why didn't you tell me you were getting your hair cut?\nRORY: It's just a trim.\nLORELAI: To the Braille Institute, it's just a trim.\nRORY: Do you like it?\nLORELAI: Will you put it back if I don't?\nRORY: Mom!\nLORELAI: Yes, I like it.\nRORY: Thank you.\n[the alarm stops]\nRORY: Oh, thank God.\nLORELAI: Feels good when it's over, huh?\nRORY: This is crazy. When did we get an alarm?\nLORELAI: Well, apparently, Kirk. . .\nRORY: Oh, no.\nLORELAI: . . .has recently joined the Stars Hollow Security Company.\nRORY: Oh, no.\nLORELAI: And apparently, now that I'm the pretty spinster living all alone, he's concerned for my safety.\nRORY: Did he tell you all this?\nLORELAI: Do you think I labeled myself the pretty spinster?\nRORY: What did you say?\nLORELAI: I haven't talked to him face-to-face. I come home to this and there was a note and his card and his gun.\nRORY: Oh, jeez!\nLORELAI: Yeah, and then when I called the alarm-response center to complain about the alarm, no one answered. I had to leave a message with Meg - she sweeps up.\nRORY: I can't even believe there's a security company in Stars Hollow. Nothing ever happens here.\nLORELAI: Oh, that is not true. Plenty happens here.\nRORY: Like what?\nLORELAI: Like, people now break into your houses and install alarm systems.\nRORY: I heard about that.\nLORELAI: And we have a new mail carrier.\nRORY: We do?\nLORELAI: Yeah, so now if you wanna get your mail, you just have to go see Miss Patty.\nRORY: Why?\nLORELAI: 'Cause that's where he brings it. He brings Babette's mail to Andrew's, Norma's mail to the deli, and Taylor still hasn't found his mail, which I have to admit is kind of fun.\nRORY: I rescind my previous statement. This place is hopping.\nLORELAI: So, did you eat yet?\nRORY: Nope. I thought I'd let you feed me.\nLORELAI: Sure. I can feed you, but I can't know if you're getting your hair cut.\nRORY: I will never do anything again without telling you - happy?\nLORELAI: I don't know. I'm finding this whole guilt thing rather satisfying. [Rory starts to walk away] No, no, where are you going? [The alarm starts blaring again] Agh! Why did you do that?\nRORY: I was gonna get my laundry!\nLORELAI: You made it mad!\nRORY: I didn't mean to!\nLORELAI: Back in the corner, back in the corner!\nRORY: Oh.\nLORELAI: No place like home, huh?\nRORY: Yeah.\n[opening credits]\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Lorelai is making a trail of Post-It notes on the floor through the house; Rory comes out of her bedroom]\nRORY: Mom?\nLORELAI: Follow the Post-It's.\nRORY: Does our life seem at all ridiculous to you?\nLORELAI: I spent all morning carefully tracking that motion detector.\nRORY: What an excellent use of your time.\nLORELAI: We're good as long as we stay on the path.\nRORY: So I should follow the yellow stick road?\nLORELAI: We'll be here all week, try the veal. Stop.\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: Read.\nRORY: \"Crouch down and hop.\" Oh, come on.\nLORELAI: The motion-detector beam at the top of the staircase dips very low over there.\nRORY: You seriously want me to crouch down and hop?\nLORELAI: Like a little hunchbacked bunny.\nRORY: You know, I had decided that if I ever went to therapy, I was gonna leave you out of it, but now. . .\nLORELAI: Okay, you can stand up.\nRORY: Did you at least call the stupid security company again?\nLORELAI: Yes, Meg sends her love. Don't worry - I'll stop by on my way to the inn. And what are your plans today, Persis Khambata?\nRORY: Well, today, I'm going to do nothing but hang out in town, read, veg, drink coffee, and have the perfect Stars Hollow day.\nLORELAI: Look out. I get to go over to the inn and hear a contractor laugh at me every time I say, \"But that won't cost too much more, right?\"\nRORY: Enjoy.\nLORELAI: Late lunch at Luke's?\nRORY: You're on. So, uh, which way do I go?\nLORELAI: Oh, just follow the Post-It's.\nRORY: But they're going in two different directions.\nLORELAI: They are?\nRORY: Look.\nLORELAI: Oh. I must have kicked some out of the way by accident.\nRORY: Well, which one do I take?\nLORELAI: Which looks more intentional?\nRORY: No Post-It path looks intentional.\nLORELAI: I'm drawing a complete blank.\nRORY: You seriously don't remember?\nLORELAI: Sorry.\nRORY: Well, how are we supposed to get out of our house?\n[Lorelai, imitating Jeannie from I Dream of Jeannie, crosses her arms, nods her head, and blinks]\nLORELAI: Unng!\nRORY: I hate Kirk.\nCUT TO THE GAZEBO\n[Rory is sitting on the bench reading and listening to music. A man walks up and sets down a box]\nRORY: Whoa. What's going on?\nMAN: I'm just setting things up for tomorrow.\nRORY: Oh, tomorrow. What's -\nMAN 2: Heads up!\n[another man throws a package of tablecloths to the man in the gazebo]\nRORY: Whoa.\nMAN: I think you may need to move.\nRORY: Yeah, I kinda got that. Excuse me. What's tomorrow?\n[Across the lawn, Lindsay and her mom are talking with a wedding planner]\nLINDSAY: . . .tons of tulle so that everything looks like frosting.\nMRS. LISTER: She's our only daughter - frost the town.\nLINDSAY: Now, where should we put the poster? I want to make sure everybody sees it.\nMRS. LISTER: Oh, what about next to the cake?\nLINDSAY: Yes, next to the cake.\n[Rory walks away in the other direction]\nCUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES\n[Rory walks in]\nRORY: Lane.\nLANE: Rory.\nRORY: Have you heard of a phone? Because as my friend, it is your responsibility to use it to call me and tell me that my ex-boyfriend's wedding is on Sunday so I'm not accidentally in it.\nLANE: What?\nRORY: I'm sitting out in the gazebo, reading, and this guy almost brains me with a stack of tablecloths.\nLANE: Oh, that's right, they're having their reception in the town square.\nRORY: Yes, and Lindsay was out there holding a giant picture of her with Dean, and. . .\nLANE: Oh my God, did she see you?\nRORY: I don't think so. I do a pretty good idiot run when I need to.\nLANE: I'm sorry, I meant to tell you. I just didn't know you were coming home this weekend. It totally slipped my mind. Things have been so crazy. I just figured I'd tell you when we talked, and then we didn't, and. . .oh, I'm sorry, can you hold on for a sec?\n[She opens an armoire. Zach and Brian are inside]\nZACH: Not cool, Lane.\nLANE: I'm sorry, guys.\nBRIAN: Fourth time today.\nLANE: Well, I thought Rory was my mom.\nZACH: The resemblance is uncanny.\nBRIAN: We should get your mom a bell like a cat.\nRORY: What's going on?\nLANE: We're having a band meeting. We need to figure out what to do about a guitarist.\nBRIAN: I think I got a splinter.\nZACH: You know that a splinter can get into your bloodstream, go straight to your heart, and kill you.\nBRIAN: Why would you tell me that?\nZACH: Whatever, dude. This is lame. I'm gonna bail.\nLANE: Zach, come on.\nBRIAN: We need to find a guitarist.\nLANE: That's right. We have come too far to let the band fall apart just because Dave -\nZACH: Hey, do not say the \"d\" word, Lane.\nLANE: But -\nZACH: Don't.\nLANE: Dave -\nZACH: Dave is dead to me. Comprendo? Dead. Cover the mirror, rip a shirt, that guy doesn't exist.\nBRIAN: He just went to college, Zach.\nZACH: No, he did not just go to college. He walked out on his art, man. He walked out on his sound. Do you think a sound is so easy to find? Did you ever see that Glenn Miller movie? For two hours, Jimmy Stewart's walking around, \"I gotta find a sound. I gotta find a sound.\" Well, we had a sound and Dave took that sound to freaking California. You don't come back from California, man. It changes you.\nLANE: What did you expect him to do - not go to college?\nZACH: No true rock 'n' roller goes to college!\nRORY: Mick Jagger went to the London School of Economics.\nZACH: What?\nRORY: Yeah, and, uh, Dexter Holland of The Offspring got his PhD in molecular biology at USC. Greg Ginn of Black Flag graduated from UCLA. The guy from Bad Religion got his masters in geology from UCLA, and he's working on his PhD in evolutionary biology at Cornell.\nZACH: Lane, she's your friend.\nRORY: I'm sorry. Um, I'm going. I'll call you later.\nLANE: Hey, are you mad?\nRORY: No, I'm not, I promise. I'm just - I'm just a little surprised. I mean, Dean's wedding. . .\nLANE: I know.\nRORY: But it's okay. It just means that I have to be a little more careful about where I go this weekend, that's all.\nLANE: Okay, well, I'll see you tomorrow. We're using the garage - guitar auditions.\nRORY: Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.\nZACH: Shut up, shut up, shut up. Weezer did not go to Harvard.\nBRIAN: Not the whole band, just the lead -\nZACH: Get away from me! I mean it.\nRORY: Bye.\nLANE: Bye.\n[Rory leaves. She sees Dean out front on the sidewalk]\nRORY: Hi.\nDEAN: Hi. Uh, were you. . .\nRORY: Oh, I was at, uh, Lane's.\nDEAN: Right, Lane's. Um.\nRORY: Um.\nDEAN: So, you're home this weekend.\nRORY: Yeah, I, uh, I ran out of clean clothes and quarters, so. . .how are things?\nDEAN: Good. You?\nRORY: Good.\nDEAN: You like Yale?\nRORY: I love Yale.\nDEAN: I figured.\nRORY: And Connecticut State?\nDEAN: It's. . .it's good.\nRORY: Oh, good. I'm glad it's good. I mean, not that I would have had any recourse if it wasn't, but, uh, this makes my lack of recourse a lot easier to deal with. So, I see you've taken over the town.\nDEAN: Oh, yeah. Uh, well, Lindsay thought. . .she likes the gazebo, and. . .\nRORY: And it's her wedding.\nDEAN: It is her wedding.\nRORY: And your wedding. I mean, it's your wedding, too.\nDEAN: Yes, it is. It's my wedding, too.\nRORY: Well, it's nice. It's, um, it's pretty. It looks like heaven or a Victoria's Secret commercial, which, to some people is basically the same thing.\nDEAN: I didn't know you'd be home this weekend.\nRORY: It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.\nDEAN: Because if I had known, I would have, you know, invited you.\nRORY: Oh. Oh, well, it's. . .\nDEAN: I mean, I didn't want you to think I was just not inviting you.\nRORY: No, I didn't think that.\nDEAN: I just figured you'd be at school.\nRORY: 'Cause you're logical.\nDEAN: I just didn't know.\nRORY: No, I know you didn't know.\nDEAN: I didn't want you to think -\nRORY: No, I didn't think. I don't think. I go to Yale now. They think for you.\nDEAN: But, hey, since you are here, come.\nRORY: Come?\nDEAN: To my wedding. Come to my wedding.\nRORY: Oh, Dean. . .\nDEAN: You and Lorelai, I want you to.\nRORY: Well. . .\nDEAN: Chicken or beef?\nRORY: What?\nDEAN: Wait, beef. Of course, beef. I mean, the two of you are definitely beef. I mean, not like you resemble beef or anything.\nRORY: You know, you don't even have to -\nDEAN: Okay, so, noon at the church. I'll be the one in the tux. And don't worry, we didn't write our own vows and no one's singing opera. I know you think that's lame.\nRORY: Oh, no, well, it's a wedding. It's supposed to be. . .operatic.\nDEAN: Okay, so, I better get over there. Lindsay's expecting me. Uh, so, I'll just see you two tomorrow.\nRORY: But. . .\nCUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE\n[Lorelai is in the living room staring at the alarm system control pad]\nKIRK: [calls from upstairs] Now?\nLORELAI: Nothing.\nKIRK: What about now?\nLORELAI: No, nothing.\nKIRK: Okay. Now?\nLORELAI: Nothing. Kirk, what's supposed to happen?\nKIRK: What?\nLORELAI: I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for. Kirk?\nKIRK: I'm not sure.\nLORELAI: Kirk, please come downstairs.\nKIRK: Are you going to hurt me?\nLORELAI: Kirk.\nKIRK: [walking downstairs] I swear, they told me it would be self-explanatory. I just had to get in the main box, and in seconds, this thing would be disabled. They didn't tell me that I needed a key or that if I didn't have a key, that I would be mildly electrocuted, and then, after all that, when I got in the box, there's nothing self-explanatory about it.\nLORELAI: Kirk.\nKIRK: I was trying to do a nice thing.\nLORELAI: I know.\nKIRK: And Jimmy said he would install it for me because I do not have those skills yet. The class was full by the time I got there.\nLORELAI: That's okay.\nKIRK: Damn my constant tardiness.\nLORELAI: Kirk, please, what can we do right now? The alarm is just so loud.\nKIRK: Yeah, that's my fault, too. I asked Jimmy to really crank it up.\nLORELAI: Well, he did.\nKIRK: If you're gonna have an alarm, you need it loud. You don't want some crazed, knife-wielding gunman at your throat and the neighbors are going, like, \"Is that a fan? Did I leave the water running?\" You want them to know, \"Hey, that's an alarm.\"\nLORELAI: Your imaginary attacker has a knife and a gun?\nKIRK: And a really dirty tank top.\nLORELAI: Okay. So, uh, Jimmy's out of town, but until he gets back, we can. . .\nKIRK: Change the code.\nLORELAI: Really? To something I know?\nKIRK: You can pick it.\nLORELAI: You know how to do that?\nKIRK: Yes, I do.\nLORELAI: That is perfect.\nKIRK: Okay, here we go. Just punch in a 7-number sequence.\nLORELAI: You got it.\n[Sookie walks in]\nSOOKIE: Hey.\nLORELAI: Hi.\nSOOKIE: Did you know your phone's not working?\nLORELAI: What?\nSOOKIE: I've been calling you for an hour. I had the operator check it. She said it's cut off or something.\nLORELAI: It was working this morning.\nKIRK: I'll be right back.\nLORELAI: Kirk!\nKIRK: I have tape. [goes upstairs]\nSOOKIE: You look tired.\nLORELAI: Yeah, well, Kirk.\nSOOKIE: Right. Hey, listen, I got a call today.\nLORELAI: From?\nSOOKIE: Michel. A very upset Michel.\nLORELAI: Why?\nSOOKIE: Well, apparently, he called you and you never called him back.\nLORELAI: When did he call me?\nSOOKIE: He said he called you in July.\nLORELAI: I was in Europe in July.\nSOOKIE: I think that he thinks we're trying to ease him out of the Dragonfly.\nLORELAI: Oh, come on. Why would he think that?\nSOOKIE: I don't know, but he was so hysterical that his voice got into that high-pitched squeal he does, and all I could make out was \"fire\" and \"abandon me\" and something about not receiving a thank-you card for the Statue of Liberty.\nLORELAI: That is crazy. He knows we always intended to take him with us. I mean, we love Michel, right?\nSOOKIE: Right. He's the best concierge in the world.\nLORELAI: Absolutely. A little abrasive.\nSOOKIE: Kind of impatient.\nLORELAI: But charming.\nSOOKIE: And great at what he does, knows the community.\nLORELAI: Willing to go that extra mile.\nSOOKIE: Tiny bit obnoxious.\nLORELAI: Makes you want to scream, \"life's too short!\" two, three times a day, but. . .\nSOOKIE: Picture life without him. We do need him, right?\nLORELAI: Let's just go down there and talk to him.\nSOOKIE: Right.\nCUT TO FANCY HOTEL\n[Lorelai and Sookie walk in]\nLORELAI: Well, we know where all those Calvin Klein ads went to die.\nSOOKIE: They look like they all had the same mother.\nLORELAI: That must be one tired supermodel.\n[a woman walks by]\nLORELAI: Excuse me, we're look-\n[the woman ignores her and keeps walking]\nLORELAI: I wouldn't talk to us either.\nSOOKIE: Hey, talk to a boy. A boy will be nice to you.\nLORELAI: Okay.\n[they walk up to the front desk]\nLORELAI: Hi. Excuse me, we're looking for Michel Gerard.\nCONCIERGE: The corner of Mercer and Broom.\nLORELAI: Excuse me?\n[the man points to his headset]\nLORELAI: Oh, Janet Jackson's on the phone.\nSOOKIE: Oh.\nCONCIERGE: Uh huh, no worries. Hi.\nSOOKIE: Us?\nCONCIERGE: Yes.\nLORELAI: Oh.\nSOOKIE: We're looking for Michel Gerard.\nCONCIERGE: Michel.\nSOOKIE: Yes, Michel Ger. . . Janet again.\nLORELAI: She's very needy lately.\nCONCIERGE: You have some guests at the front desk. Uh-huh. No worries. He comes like the wind.\nLORELAI: Thanks. He doesn't need our thanks.\nSOOKIE: Well, he has Janet, so. . .\n[Michel walks through the lobby toward the front desk talking on a headset]\nMICHEL: You have reservations at Tamtam at 7:00. Do not order the duck because it will take forever and you will miss the curtain. If you have any problems at all, you have my pager number. Just call me. Goodbye. [to Lorelai and Sookie] Well, look who the cat dragged in.\nLORELAI: Hi, Michel. We've missed you.\nMICHEL: Yes? Well, I have missed you, too.\nLORELAI: This place is wonderful.\nSOOKIE: You look so important, walking around, talking to yourself. But you're not really talking to yourself. You're actually talking to someone else in a headset with your headset.\nLORELAI: How are you?\nMICHEL: Me? I am wonderful, and yourselves?\nLORELAI: We're great, and we're breaking ground on the inn on Monday.\nMICHEL: Oh, yes. Is that still happening?\nLORELAI: It is still happening.\nMICHEL: Well, that's lovely. There's a small charge for the use of the internet. All instructions are in the minibar. I'm so pleased.\nLORELAI: Listen, Michel, I know you're a little upset with me.\nMICHEL: Upset? I don't think so.\nSOOKIE: It's okay, I told her about the call.\nMICHEL: What call?\nSOOKIE: The call you made to me yesterday, the one where you told me that you called Lorelai and she didn't call back.\nMICHEL: I make so many calls.\nSOOKIE: The one where you cried.\nMICHEL: Are you sure it wasn't another Michel?\nSOOKIE: You called me! You kept me on the phone for over an hour. I missed the beginning of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, and by the time I got back, they were all gay.\nLORELAI: Okay, it doesn't matter. We just want you to know if there was any misunderstanding about wanting you to come with us to the Dragonfly, well, we're sorry.\nSOOKIE: I'm not.\nMICHEL: Well, that's very sweet of you to say. Thank you.\nLORELAI: Unless you don't want to come with us. I mean, this place is very impressive, and I would understand if you didn't want to leave.\nMICHEL: Yes, this place is impressive, isn't it? I mean, the uniform alone - like working in your jammies. And these headsets, are they not fabulous? Especially when, for example, you're in the bathroom, a place one would normally choose to be alone, then suddenly, bang, someone is yakking in your ear. How delightful. You can never get lonely.\nLORELAI: I suppose not.\nMICHEL: And the people who work here. . .a joy. So young, so talented. Some of them are actors in ambitious off-Broadway revues. They play cockroaches and derelicts and do Shakespeare dressed like punk rockers. It gives me chills just thinking about it. Yes, extra towels are complimentary, Matthew, and stop asking me who the hottie I'm talking to is. I'll tell you what, I'll think about it and get back to you, okay?\nLORELAI: Nice to have you aboard, Michel.\nMICHEL: I'm busy, go. Thank God. Matthew, what?\nCUT TO LUKE'S DINER\n[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]\nLORELAI: So, he invited us to his wedding.\nRORY: And we're having beef.\nLORELAI: Well, what was his body language like?\nRORY: Tall.\nLORELAI: No, I mean, did he squirm or back away when he invited you or was he all darty-eyed?\nRORY: Not much squirming, no backing away, but there was a little bit of darty-eye.\nLORELAI: So, he was nervous.\nRORY: Well, we were both nervous. I mean, we didn't expect to run into each other, and I think he probably just invited us 'cause he felt like he had to, to be nice.\nLORELAI: That does sound like Dean.\nRORY: So, what do we do? Do we go?\nLORELAI: Oh, I can't decide this. He's your ex-boyfriend.\nRORY: It seems weird that we go.\nLORELAI: Then we don't go.\nRORY: But if we don't go, it may look like we're trying to make some kind of statement.\nLORELAI: Then we go.\nRORY: If I had just stayed at Lane's for two more minutes. . .\nLORELAI: Yeah, fate.\nRORY: Yes, it is fate. Do we ignore fate?\nLORELAI: I don't know. Do you have any important papers due soon?\nRORY: Why?\nLORELAI: Just in case.\nRORY: Fate's gonna flunk me?\nLORELAI: It's always a possibility.\nRORY: Well, then that's it. We are going.\nLUKE: Going where?\nRORY: Dean's wedding. Fate's making us.\nLORELAI: I hope fate will cough up forty bucks for a salad spinner for him.\nLUKE: Please, there is no fate.\nLORELAI: What do you mean there is no fate? Of course there is fate.\nLUKE: There is no fate, there is no destiny, there is no luck. Astrology is ridiculous. Tarot cards tell you nothing. You cannot read a palm. Tea leaves make tea and nothing else. Jim Morrison is not hanging out with Elvis, and the Kennedys did not kill Marilyn.\nLORELAI: I totally knew you were gonna say that.\nLUKE: I came over here. My fault.\nLORELAI: I read your mind. It spoke to me. We're psychic.\nLUKE: Enjoy the fries.\nLORELAI: So where does this leave us?\nRORY: Well, I think that Dean's gonna expect us to go, and it is his day, and I don't want him to feel like I don't care about him.\nLORELAI: I know.\nORY: I just want him to be happy.\nLORELAI: Okay, we'll get him a salad spinner first thing tomorrow morning.\nRORY: Thank you.\n[Miss Patty walks in]\nMISS PATTY: Oh, there you are. Honey, I've got your mail.\nLORELAI: Oh, great.\nMISS PATTY: Oh, I'm exhausted. I've been looking all over town for you.\nLORELAI: Oh, Patty, you could have just left me a message. I would have stopped by and picked it up.\nMISS PATTY: Oh, there was something marked urgent in there, and I just wanted to make sure you got it.\nLORELAI: Hm, thank you.\nMISS PATTY: All right, I'm leaving. Oh, I'm gonna kill that mail carrier. I don't care if he doesn't have a tongue. [leaves]\nRORY: Our new mail carrier doesn't have a tongue?\nLORELAI: You've got to be kidding me.\nRORY: That's what Patty just said.\nLORELAI: No, Taylor has sent me a cease and desist order on the inn.\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: [reads letter] \"Dear Lorelai Gilmore, it has come to the attention of the Stars Hollow Historical Preservation Society that you and Miss Sookie St. James intend to commence construction on the Dragonfly Inn. Any proposed renovations must be submitted, discussed, and approved by the Stars Hollow Historical Preservation Society. We must therefore ask that all work halt until such time that this procedure has been followed. Thank you, and have a historical day.\" Is he kidding?\nRORY: What are you gonna do?\nLORELAI: I'm going to talk to him.\nRORY: Cool.\nLORELAI: Don't say cool like that. It's gonna be very pleasant.\nRORY: I thought you said you were gonna go talk to Taylor.\nLORELAI: I own my own business now, Rory. I'm gonna have to deal with tiny men like Taylor all the time. You can't go around yelling at people, no matter how historical they might be.\nRORY: Bummer.\nLORELAI: You have to learn to separate the personal from the business.\nRORY: Okay.\n[they walk outside and head toward the soda shop]\nLORELAI: Remember in The Godfather, Michael telling Sonny how he was gonna kill Tattaglia and Captain McCluskey in that Italian restaurant? He lays out the whole thing very calmly, very unemotionally, 'cause that's what you do in business.\nRORY: Yeah, but then he went and shot two guys in the head.\nLORELAI: Okay, but I wasn't describing that scene.\nCUT TO THE SODA SHOP\nTAYLOR: [to customer] But if you know you already like lime, then you're not sampling, you're savoring, and that's just gluttonous.\n[Lorelai and Rory walk in]\nLORELAI: Hi, Taylor.\nTAYLOR: Well, hello there. Lorelai, Rory, what can I get for you?\nLORELAI: Oh, well, gosh, look at all the choices, really hard to pick. I think I'll try a scoop of butter brickle crunch. Rory?\nRORY: I'll try the chocolate chocolate chocolate.\nTAYLOR: Coming right up.\nLORELAI: Listen, Taylor, while I have you here, um, I received this letter in the mail, and I'm having kind of a blond day, and I wonder if you could explain this to me.\nTAYLOR: Well, it says you have to get approval before you can start construction on the inn.\nLORELAI: That's what I thought it said. Well, I have to tell you, Taylor, I'm a little concerned because we have a construction crew coming Monday, so. . .yikes.\nTAYLOR: Well, the Dragonfly is a historical building, Lorelai.\nLORELAI: Yeah, but the whole town is a historical building, Taylor. I mean, George Washington ate, slept, or blew his nose all over the damn place.\nTAYLOR: He only blew his nose in the park. You've read the sign.\nLORELAI: Taylor, that inn needs love. It's falling down. Sookie and I have no intention of ruining its historical aspect. We'd just like some running water.\nTAYLOR: Running water was not always historical.\nLORELAI: You're not seriously telling me I can't put in running water?\nRORY: Oh, my God, this is incredible. It's called chocolate chocolate chocolate, but it's seriously chocolate chocolate chocolaty. Sorry.\nTAYLOR: I'm just telling you, there are rules and they have to be followed.\nLORELAI: Fine. What do I have to do to get the Historical Preservation Society's stamp of approval?\nTAYLOR: Well, a formal presentation is necessary.\nLORELAI: Uh-huh. When?\nTAYLOR: Uh, any town function or gathering is open to a presentation, Lorelai.\nLORELAI: Okay, so, like, the town meeting tonight?\nTAYLOR: If you like.\nLORELAI: The town meeting it is.\nTAYLOR: Oh, now, don't look sad. I went through this with my place, too. Of course, I knew the rules so I didn't get the embarrassing letter.\nLORELAI: Right, okay, great. Well, we'll see you later, Taylor.\nTAYLOR: Oh, uh. . .\nLORELAI: Yes?\nTAYLOR: That'll be $3.50 for the ice cream.\nRORY: And worth every penny, let me tell you. Sorry, but this is really good.\nCUT TO TOWN MEETING\nTAYLOR: So, any additional landscaping to the town square will be paid for directly from the town park funds, and town park funds only. All righty.\nRORY: Long one tonight.\nLORELAI: Astonishingly long.\nSOOKIE: We've got to be next, right?\nLORELAI: We've got to be. Michel, are you okay over there?\nSOOKIE: He says the guy next to him has unforgivable B.O.\nLORELAI: Michel, you're French. How can you even tell?\nTAYLOR: Could we have a little quiet please?\nLORELAI: Sorry, Taylor, we're just waiting here very patiently, as you can see, all ready and everything.\nTAYLOR: Yes, well, um, the next item, people, is a wonderful feather in Stars Hollow's cap. One of our very own, fourth grader Donny Pass, was named a runner-up in the Connecticut State story-writing contest for his work entitled The Happiest Doughnut.\nSOOKIE: I think I'm gonna give birth just out of boredom.\nTAYLOR: Donny's mom is here tonight. Let's give her a big hand.\nLORELAI: I almost think he's doing this on purpose.\nSOOKIE: Almost? Huh.\nLORELAI: Bordering on pretty damn sure.\nTAYLOR: I won't spoil the plot of The Happiest Doughnut for you, folks, except to say it's funny and a little sad and truly inspiring. But a caveat for all you parents - the dunking scene may be too intense for preschool-aged children.\nGYPSY: How can a stupid doughnut be happy?\nRORY: But see, he's got you curious. That's the genius of Donny Pass.\nGYPSY: Hey, I've got a bunch of your mail. Here.\nRORY: Oh, I've got some of yours, too, and some of Al's. Will you pass this back to him for me?\nGYPSY: Yeah. Oh, if you hand this up to Andrew.\nRORY: Can do.\n[The townspeople start exchanging their mail]\nLORELAI: I can't smell anything.\nMICHEL: I'm breathing it all in so it's not reaching you.\nLORELAI: Thanks for taking that grenade for me, pal.\nTAYLOR: People, could we have some order here?\nANDREW: Oh, Gypsy, the letter from my girlfriend's open.\nGYPSY: Oh, yeah. Sorry, Andrew. It must have fallen open accidentally.\nANDREW: You read my private letter.\nGYPSY: There's nothing private in that letter. Except for the medical stuff.\nMISS PATTY: Taylor, I got your PennySaver and your girly magazines.\nTAYLOR: Those are lifestyle magazines. People, this meeting has degenerated into our usual weekly anarchy. I say we adjourn. We'll see you next week.\nSOOKIE: What?\nLORELAI: Uh, Taylor!\nTAYLOR: Everyone pick up a free copy of The Happiest Doughnut on your way out. You won't be sorry.\nLORELAI: Taylor, wait, we were supposed to make our presentation about the Dragonfly.\nTAYLOR: Oh, yes. Well, uh, you're bringing this up kind of late.\nLORELAI: Well, we've been sitting here.\nSOOKIE: It won't take long.\nLORELAI: It was your idea, remember? You suggested this.\nTAYLOR: Well, okay. People, your children and elderly are going to have to wait a while longer for you to get home because Lorelai Gilmore and her associates want to discuss some proposed changes to a beloved town structure.\nLORELAI: Thank you. Let's go, Sook, Augustus Gloop.\nRORY: Knock 'em dead.\nLORELAI: Guys, I know we've been here forever, but I very quickly want to tell you what we have in mind for this beautiful Dragonfly property.\nTAYLOR: The historic Dragonfly property.\nLORELAI: I think that goes without saying.\nTAYLOR: I don't think you should try to hide the fact that it's historic.\nLORELAI: Okay, I'm not hiding anything.\nTAYLOR: Proceed, please.\nLORELAI: Okay, well, we're very excited -\nTAYLOR: How many guest rooms will this establishment have?\nLORELAI: Um, ten.\nTAYLOR: Ugh, tsk, tsk, tsk.\nLORELAI: Yeah, ten. Anyway, the property's been unoccupied for -\nTAYLOR: And parking? How many parking spaces?\nLORELAI: Um, eighteen.\nTAYLOR: Oh, hm.\nLORELAI: Something wrong with the parking, Taylor?\nTAYLOR: Two people to a room, each with their own car, that's twenty cars - you don't have enough parking.\nLORELAI: But some of the people will be driving there together in one car.\nTAYLOR: So, you have a crystal ball, do you?\nLORELAI: That's just common sense.\nTAYLOR: Because if you have a crystal ball, I sure would like to borrow it to take to the racetrack.\nLORELAI: Um, no, I don't have a crystal ball, but if the parking's not enough, we can always add more.\nSOOKIE: Easy.\nTAYLOR: So, pave paradise and put up a parking lot.\nSOOKIE: Not what we're saying.\nTAYLOR: I heard you were planning to serve alcohol - is this true?\nLORELAI: Well, there will be a restaurant.\nSOOKIE: Wine, cocktails. Give the people what they want.\nTAYLOR: So it'll be a party spot, huh?\nLORELAI: Uh, no.\nTAYLOR: Catering to that crowd - hip-hoppers, the Manson family.\nLORELAI: It's a little country inn.\nTAYLOR: A perfect secluded spot for murderers to revel in impropriety.\nMICHEL: Have you noticed, this is not going very well.\nLORELAI: Taylor, everyone, there will be millions of questions, some of them even legitimate, but the bottom line is, you know me. I've been apart of this town for. . .well, look how big my daughter is - for that long. And opening this inn has been a dream of mine and of Sookie's for most of that time. Along with Michel, we plan to make this community as proud of the historic Dragonfly Inn as you were when the same team was running the Independence Inn.\nTAYLOR: You mean the place that burned down on your watch?\nMICHEL: Can I slap him?\nLORELAI: Uh, now, this will also help our local economy because we plan to employ. . .[her cell phone rings] Sorry, we plan to employ - huh. Uh, this, uh, call is coming from the house.\nRORY: Our house?\nLORELAI: It's flashing our number.\nRORY: But we're here.\nLORELAI: I know. That's the weird part. Sookie, uh, keep it going in here. I'll be just a quick, um, second.\nSOOKIE: Okay, if you have any questions. . .\nMICHEL: Yes, about the Dragonfly or deodorant - the places to buy it, how to apply it, that sort of thing.\n[Lorelai goes outside to answer her phone]\nLORELAI: Hello?\nKIRK: I responded to the activation of an alarm at your residence, and I apprehended a prowler in the garage.\nLORELAI: You did?\nKIRK: Yes, ma'am - female, approximately eighteen years old, Korean.\nLORELAI: Kirk, that's Lane. You know Lane.\nKIRK: I thought I knew Lane, but now I think she's in some kind of gang.\nLANE: Lorelai, help.\nKIRK: Their front is some sort of musical group.\nLORELAI: They are a musical group, Kirk. [to Rory] Honey, go sort it out.\nRORY: Got it.\nLORELAI: Rory's on her way over - brown hair, blue eyes, about 5'6\" - don't cuff her.\nKIRK: 10-4.\nLORELAI: Okay.\n[Lorelai hangs up as Sookie and Michel walk out of the dance studio]\nLORELAI: What -\nSOOKIE: We failed you.\nMICHEL: He is a very unpleasant man.\nLORELAI: What happened?\nSOOKIE: The second, I mean, the second you walked out the door, Taylor adjourned the meeting over our objections.\nLORELAI: Well, where is he? Where'd he go?\nSOOKIE: He was the first one out the door.\nLORELAI: Unbelievable. Hm, you can run but you can't hide.\nMICHEL: Oh, this is cute. . . The Happy Doughnut.\n[Lorelai goes to catch up to Taylor]\nLORELAI: Hey, uh, we have a little misunderstanding back there, Taylor?\nTAYLOR: Lorelai, please don't sneak up on me like that. I almost blew my emergency whistle.\nLORELAI: We weren't done.\nTAYLOR: Oh, I thought we were.\nLORELAI: No, we weren't.\nTAYLOR: Well, what more was there to say?\nLORELAI: Nothing was decided. You said to come to the town meeting and explain what you're doing, then we can start our work.\nTAYOR: Oh, well, you can't do that until after the walk-through.\nLORELAI: Oh, Taylor, I'm in heels. Do you mind? What walk-through?\nTAYLOR: I and other members of the Historical Preservation Society need to examine the property in person. You didn't think we were gonna make a decision based on a little chat, did you? I'm sure I mentioned a walk-through.\nLORELAI: I don't think you did.\nTAYLOR: Well, I'm mentioning it now.\nLORELAI: Okay, so, when's the walk-through?\nTAYLOR: Well, I'd have to check with the other society members, set something up in the next month or so.\nLORELAI: But I have workmen coming Monday, Taylor, the day after tomorrow.\nTAYLOR: Oh, dear. That's cutting it pretty close.\nLORELAI: Let's do it tomorrow, please - tomorrow.\nTAYLOR: Tomorrow's Sunday.\nLORELAI: Yes, it is.\nTAYLOR: Well, it would have to be before church.\nLORELAI: Okay, so midmorning?\nTAYLOR: Six?\nLORELAI: Six? Six in the morning?\nTAYLOR: Or another day - I could take it up with the society.\nLORELAI: No, no, six is fine. Six sharp.\nTAYLOR: See you then.\nLORELAI: Bright and early.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCUT TO LUKE'S DINER\nCUSTOMER: Goodnight.\nLUKE: Goodnight. Thanks.\n[A group of boys are walking toward the diner]\nBOYS: [singing] We do or die for Stars Hollow High! We do or die for Stars Hollow High! It's the one we fight and fall for, it's the one we give our all for.\nLUKE: Oh, goody.\n[the boys enter the diner]\nBOYS: Stars Hollow High! Whoo!\nBOY 1: That is our Stars Hollow High fight song.\nLUKE: Could've sworn it was Mozart. What is this, guys?\nKYLE: Pit stop!\nBOYS: Whoo!\nKYLE: Bachelor party, phase one is over.\nBOY 2: Our boy Dean here is tying the knot.\nLUKE: Look, I was just closing up.\nDEAN: Luke!\nLUKE: Dean!\nDEAN: That's funny.\nLUKE: I wasn't even trying.\nKYLE: We just need to refuel for phase two, sir. It won't take long.\nDEAN: You wouldn't turn away a man on his wedding day, would you?\nLUKE: It's not your wedding day yet.\nBOY 1: That's what I keep telling him, dude. It's your last day of freedom.\nBOY 2: Hey, we should get strippers, right?\nDEAN: And cake.\nBOY 3: Hey, my name's Luke, too. We should start a club or something.\nLUKE: Yeah, that would be swell. Look, guys, why don't you go sit down over there? I'll make some coffee.\nDEAN: Tomorrow is the big day, man - big day.\nLUKE: You're tipping there, Dean. Watch him.\nKYLE: I got him, sir. We really appreciate this, sir.\nLUKE: Stop calling me that.\nDEAN: He's a good guy, really.\nLUKE: So, what was phase one?\nKYLE: A case of beer in the JC Penney parking lot, then batting cages and laser tag.\nDEAN: I've decided that I really like beer.\nKYLE: I'm the designated driver.\nLUKE: Good man.\nKYLE: I'm in the Navy now, you know.\nLUKE: Uniform tipped me off.\nKYLE: My older cousins did two-year stints. It paid for their college and stuff, so I joined up. Of course, we weren't fighting international skirmishes on two or three dangerous fronts like we are now.\nLUKE: Hey, what are you doing?\nBOY 2: Sugar football.\nLUKE: Don't.\nKYLE: Come on, guys, respect the establishment. They're still kids.\nLUKE: I got a better idea, guys. How about I whip up some pancakes real fast, help soak up whatever it is you drank?\nKYLE: Sounds good. We'll be needing energy for phase two.\nBOY 2: Strippers, right? We gotta get strippers.\nBOY 3: Hey, how much do you give a stripper?\nBOY 1: Well, that depends on what she does.\nKYLE: Are they really prostitutes? 'Cause I'd feel bad if they were prostitutes.\nLUKE: Look, guys, I gotta go in the back for a couple seconds. Don't drink anymore. Don't play jets. Don't jump on the furniture. Just sit still, okay?\nBOY 2: And do what?\nLUKE: I don't know. Make up a dirty version of the fight song or something.\nBOY 1: Yeah!\nBOY 2: Great idea!\nDEAN: [mumbles] Rory.\nBOY 3: What did he say?\nBOY 1: Oh, he is so toasted.\nDEAN: [mumbles] Rory.\nKYLE: Did he say what I think he said?\nLUKE: Hey guys, you know what I think? I think it's real late and that maybe you ought to cancel phase two.\nBOY 1: No way.\nKYLE: Hear him out, fellas.\nLUKE: I mean, think about it, guys - how you gonna beat laser tag?\nBOY 1: I don't know.\nBOY 2: Aw, is Dean sick?\nLUKE: He just needs his rest. Kyle, why don't you march your friends out of here? I'll take care of the groom, and he'll see you all tomorrow.\nKYLE: He's right, guys. Let's saddle up.\nBOY 2: Aren't we getting pancakes?\nBOY 1: I'm not feeling good.\nLUKE: Come on, big guy.\nDEAN: What?\nLUKE: Try to walk.\n[The boys leave, singing the fight song. Luke takes Dean upstairs to his apartment]\nLUKE: Here we are.\nDEAN: She's smart, man. You know, she's so smart.\nLUKE: I know, I know.\nDEAN: She could probably fix the world, you know?\nLUKE: Right, right. She could team up with Kyle - her brains, his brawn.\nDEAN: No, not Kyle - Rory.\nLUKE: Almost there.\nDEAN: She's the one, you know?\n[Luke walks Dean over to the bed]\nLUKE: Come on, Dean, just slide down there, stop talking.\nDEAN: And the hair - pretty hair. She has the prettiest hair. And that head. What is that?\nLUKE: Just your shoes. Shh.\nDEAN: I miss her. Why didn't she love me?\nCUT TO THE DRAGONFLY INN\n[Lorelai and Sookie are standing out front while the Historical Preservation Society members look over the property]\nSOOKIE: Scrubbing shower grout with a toothbrush.\nLORELAI: Sure, sure. Flossing with that really, really fine floss that cuts between your teeth like a razor.\nSOOKIE: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Staring into the sun.\nLORELAI: 'Til you're blind.\nSOOKIE: Absolutely.\n[Michel walks over]\nMICHEL: I feel very ugly this morning.\nLORELAI: Join the crowd.\nMICHEL: That unpleasant man and his cohorts in there?\nLORELAI: And have been for about thirty frickin' minutes.\nSOOKIE: Watching a foreign movie without subtitles.\nLORELAI: Getting brain freeze from eating ice cream.\nMICHEL: What are you doing?\nLORELAI: We're listing all the things we'd rather be doing than this.\nSOOKIE: What a mug.\nLORELAI: It's like he sucked a lemon.\nMICHEL: I've really grown to hate him.\nLORELAI: Nice, huh?\nMISS PATTY: Oh, so much potential.\nLORELAI: Yeah.\nTAYLOR: It needs a lot of TLC.\nLORELAI: And we've got an abundance of it, Taylor. [quietly to Patty] Patty, please, please, help, help. He's killing me here, and you've got pull with him.\nMISS PATTY: Oh, honey, I got my own remodeling to do on my studio that Taylor has to approve. I'm saving my pull for me.\nLORELAI: Can't I have just a little teeny, tiny bit of your pull, please?\nMISS PATTY: Oh, he's gonna see us talking.\nTAYLOR: Lorelai, consultation, please.\nLORELAI: Okay.\nTAYLOR: This porch is falling apart.\nLORELAI: I know.\nTAYLOR: It's got live termites.\nLORELAI: Big, fat ones.\nTAYLOR: It's a safety hazard.\nLORELAI: It's the first thing to go.\nTAYLOR: To go? This porch can't go.\nLORELAI: I'm sorry, Taylor. You just said it's falling apart.\nTAYLOR: I didn't tell you to tear it down. It's historical. It has to stay.\nLORELAI: No, no, the porch is not historical, Taylor. It was added in 1980.\nTAYLOR: So?\nLORELAI: So it's a 23-year-old porch. Unless you think Kate Hudson is historical, it's not historical.\nTAYLOR: Not now, but how do you think we get historical 200-year-old structures if we tear 'em down when they're just 23?\nLORELAI: Uh, it's rotting away.\nTAYLOR: Which just means that your guests can't walk on it.\nLORELAI: So they should hover over it?\nTAYLOR: No, you could build a bridge over it, using appropriate materials, of course.\nLORELAI: A bridge?\nTAYLOR: Or you could build a transparent Lucite porch over this porch, so people could walk on the Lucite porch and see the old porch underneath the new porch.\nLORELAI: Build a clear plastic porch over the rotting wood porch?\nTAYLOR: With the proper permits, of course, and those are hard to come by.\nLORELAI: That's it!\nTAYLOR: Lorelai, watch it. I've got church later.\nLORELAI: What did I do to make you torture me like this, Taylor?\nTAYLOR: I don't know what you're talking about.\nLORELAI: The hoops! The hoops with the jumping and the fire and the hoops!\nTAYLOR: It's just business, Lorelai.\nLORELAI: I pay to shop in your store. I eat your banana splits. I've never physically hurt you. . .except for that one spit wad in the one town meeting, but I didn't mean for it to hit your eye and I apologized profusely, so please, please, put me out of my misery and tell me what I need to do to make this thing happen!\nTAYLOR: I want an ice-cream truck.\nLORELAI: What?\nTAYLOR: I want to sell ice cream off a truck in the summer. I want to park it in front of the soda shop. I want to ring the bell on it every day at noon, but the only place I can park it is the space that's partly in front of Luke's diner.\nLORELAI: So?\nTAYLOR: You have pull with Luke.\nLORELAI: I guess, maybe.\nTAYLOR: You're friends.\nLORELAI: Yes.\nTAYLOR: You can get him to agree to this.\nLORELAI: Use my pull.\nTAYLOR: If you don't mind.\nLORELAI: So if I get Luke to agree to this, the madness stops?\nTAYLOR: If that's what you want to call it.\nLORELAI: The work begins and the porch goes?\nTAYLOR: All expedited, nice and neat.\nLORELAI: An ice-cream truck?\nTAYLOR: An ice-cream truck.\nLORELAI: You can go.\nTAYLOR: Well, this has been a very successful outing. Back on the bus, everyone.\nMICHEL: Unbelievable.\nSOOKIE: Yup. Hey, when do you think you'll. . .[Lorelai walks away] Shortcut to Luke's.\nMICHEL: How is she going to get over Potter's Creek?\nSOOKIE: Jump it?\nCUT TO LUKE'S DINER\n[Lorelai rushes in, out of breath]\nLORELAI: Give him his ice-cream truck.\nLUKE: What?\nLORELAI: I forged a stream and I almost got attacked by a beaver, and I'm not leaving here till you agree.\nLUKE: To what?\nLORELAI: You don't own the street, you own the building. It's a public street. Just let him park his stupid truck.\nLUKE: I'm missing something here.\nLORELAI: Don't change the subject.\nLUKE: I don't even know what the subject is.\nLORELAI: If you let Taylor park his stupid ringy-dingy ice-cream truck - not even in front of the diner, but in front of part of the diner - then I can start work on the inn. But if you don't say yes, then you may not have to see his truck parked outside, but you will have to see my body swinging from that tree over there because I will hang myself. I am waiting for your answer.\nLUKE: Sure.\nLORELAI: Sure what?\nLUKE: He can park it there. What do I care?\nLORELAI: Oh, don't kid around here.\nLUKE: Your life's at stake. I wouldn't kid around.\nLORELAI: That easy?\nLUKE: That easy.\nLORELAI: Well, why'd you say no before?\nLUKE: When?\nLORELAI: When Taylor asked you before?\nLUKE: He never asked me before.\nLORELAI: He never asked?\nLUKE: Not about a truck - about a giant ice cream cone a few months back. I said no to that. Probably why he thought I'd say no to the truck.\nLORELAI: He never asked?\nLUKE: Nope.\nLORELAI: But you're fine with this, and he could have asked?\nLUKE: It's a public street.\nLORELAI: And you would have said yes?\nLUKE: I'd have said yes.\nLORELAI: And I wouldn't have had to go through all this.\nLUKE: Probably not.\nLORELAI: You know what, I've learned something very valuable here today. Come on in. Sit down there. Take a load off. Very valuable.\nLUKE: Good.\nLORELAI: I've had a business epiphany. It's like I'm Bud Fox, saying, \"Thanks for the lesson, Mr. Gekko.\"\nLUKE: This will pass, folks.\nLORELAI: The Lorelai you knew is dead. Remember her? The eager to please, fresh of face? She thought that success in business meant working hard, applying yourself, and respecting your coworkers, and she preached that to others - oh, little child.\nLUKE: You should probably get some rest.\nLORELAI: It's about scratching backs, my friend, and kissing things - I won't be graphic.\nLUKE: It is Sunday morning.\nLORELAI: It's dirty, that's what business is. It's smoke-filled back rooms with exposed pipes and shady players chewing on fat cigars and twirling their dirty mustaches. And when you go into those rooms, you can't be a milquetoast muppet. You have to have pointy teeth and jaws that snap. The meek shall not inherit the earth!\nLUKE: Thanks for the perspective.\nLORELAI: Do you have any coffee?\nLUKE: I'm not giving you coffee.\nLORELAI: I don't have time for coffee. I gotta go find Taylor and close this deal. You think he's back at the store?\nLUKE: Or having his dirty mustache cleaned.\nLORELAI: You're good with the truck?\nLUKE: I'm good with the truck.\nLORELAI: Bless you. [leaves]\nLUKE: I'll be right with you, folks.\n[Luke walks upstairs to the apartment. Dean is sitting on the bed]\nLUKE: So, you're up.\nDEAN: Yeah, I'm up. It took me a minute or two to figure out where I am, but. . .\nLUKE: Oh, that's right. You've never been here before.\nDEAN: Yeah, it's not that I remembered. I just kinda looked out the window and that's how I could tell.\nLUKE: Good, smart. [hands him a drink] Little concoction of mine - it'll help with the hangover.\nDEAN: Guess I had a beer or two too many last night, huh?\nLUKE: Yeah, it happens.\nDEAN: Hope the guys didn't bug you too much.\nLUKE: No, they were fine.\nDEAN: Good.\nLUKE: So, you're all dressed there?\nDEAN: Yeah, uh, you know, big day - getting married.\nLUKE: Getting married.\nDEAN: Um, I'm due in the church in about an hour.\nLUKE: Hey, uh, Dean. . .\nDEAN: And I still gotta pick up my tux.\nLUKE: Yeah, right.\nDEAN: Um, thanks for everything, Luke.\nLUKE: Yeah, sure. Good luck.\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Rory and Lane are walking down the street]\nRORY: So, a total strikeout, huh?\nLANE: Total. And, you know, at first, I felt bad for them - so lacking in talent, yet so clueless. Then I just felt bad for their guitars.\nRORY: Where are all the good young musicians these days?\nLANE: My ears wanted to fly off my head. I'm going to the music store to look at things I can't afford. Want to come?\nRORY: I have to go get ready for this.\nLANE: Right. Tell me how it goes.\nRORY: I will.\n[Lane walks away. Luke walks out of the market]\nRORY: Hey, Luke.\nLUKE: Hey, Rory. Um, where's your mom?\nRORY: Uh, around somewhere. Why?\nLUKE: I thought I'd find her at Doose's. Did she go back to the inn, or. . .\nRORY: She was going back to the inn, then she was picking up a wedding present for Dean from us, because she hates it when people send gifts later. And then depending on time, I was either gonna meet her back at home or at the church.\nLUKE: She have her cell on her?\nRORY: I think it's dead. What's going on?\nLUKE: Or a pager or something?\nRORY: Is something wrong?\nLUKE: Oh, no, I just need to check something with her.\nRORY: Well, we can stop by after the wedding.\nLUKE: Don't go to the wedding.\nRORY: What?\nLUKE: Uh, don't go to Dean's wedding.\nRORY: Why?\nLUKE: I just. . .don't go. Trust me.\nRORY: Okay.\nLUKE: It'd just be better this way.\nRORY: Okay.\nLUKE: So, you're not going?\nRORY: I guess not.\nLUKE: Okay, good. Good. I'll see you guys later.\nRORY: Yeah, Luke, I'll see you later.\nLUKE: Okay.\nCUT TO SIDEWALK\n[Lorelai walks out of a store. Kirk walks up to her]\nKIRK: Lorelai, do you have a minute?\nLORELAI: Oh, sure, Kirk.\nKIRK: We've had a successful disconnection.\nLORELAI: No more alarm?\nKIRK: No more alarm.\nLORELAI: Fantastic.\nKIRK: The roofer will be out tomorrow. The repair should take about a day.\nLORELAI: I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.\nKIRK: It's all taken care of, and I want to apologize for any inconvenience.\nLORELAI: Aw, it was no big deal.\nKIRK: I have this strong sense of chivalry when it comes to women living alone.\nLORELAI: That's very nice.\nKIRK: My family tree dates back to a 12th-century knight.\nLORELAI: Wow.\nKIRK: As a kid, I thought that meant we were related to Ted Knight. I wrote him a lot of letters. He never responded.\nLORELAI: That's cute, though.\nKIRK: I just want you to feel safe.\nLORELAI: You really do, don't you, Kirk?\nKIRK: So, I hope you don't mind my watching out for you.\nLORELAI: Not at all. [she kisses his cheek]\nKIRK: Thank you. I'll see you around.\nLORELAI: See ya.\n[Kirk walks away as Rory walks over]\nRORY: Hey.\nLORELAI: Ooh, hey. I think I found the perfect wedding present for Dean. It's sweet, not too personal, classy, yet cheap.\nRORY: We're not going.\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: Luke was looking for you and ran into me, and he was all nervous and everything, and then he finally just said we shouldn't go.\nLORELAI: What does that mean?\nRORY: I think it means that we shouldn't go.\nLORELAI: Did he give a reason?\nRORY: Not really.\nLORELAI: I'll go talk to him.\nRORY: No, Mom, he seemed really serious, and I think that if you saw him you'd feel the same way. He was kind of upset.\nLORELAI: About Dean's wedding?\nRORY: Yeah.\nLORELAI: So, we're not going?\nRORY: I think it's better that we don't.\nLORELAI: Okay. Mystery, though.\nRORY: Kind of.\nLORELAI: Well, you've got your nothing-to-do weekend back.\nRORY: Yeah, got that back. Um, Mom, Kirk's following us in a little clowny car.\nLORELAI: He's watching out for us.\nRORY: Okay.\nCUT TO THE DRAGONFLY INN\n[Lorelai and Sookie are standing on the porch with sledgehammers as Michel gets ready to take a picture]\nMICHEL: Ready?\nLORELAI: No, no, it's gotta look like we're actually demolishing the porch.\nSOOKIE: We're gonna do pretend swings.\nLORELAI: Which would have been easier if we had pretend sledgehammers.\nSOOKIE: Why do they make these so heavy?\nMICHEL: Well, even without the swing, this is a good picture of the two of you about to record an important moment for the two of you.\nLORELAI: Um, Michel -\nMICHEL: I would love a copy of this for my mantel, such a nice moment.\nLORELAI: You have to be in the picture, too, Michel.\nMICHEL: Me? I don't know. All right.\nSOOKIE: That thing have a timer on it?\nMICHEL: It's set. I framed the shot. Grab your hammer and smile.\n[they pose for the picture]\nLORELAI: One more for safety?\nMICHEL: Okay.\nSOOKIE: What?\nLORELAI: Just sometimes, it hits me. This place had a long history before us, has a long future after us. I keep thinking it's apart of our lives, but, really, it's the reverse. For a little while. . .I don't know. . .it's like we're apart of its life.\nSOOKIE: Yeah.\n[The three of them pose for another picture]\nCUT TO THE TOWN SQUARE\n[Rory watches from afar as Dean and Lindsay walk out of the church after their wedding ceremony]\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

All four are dressed in black.\nFrasier: Oh, hi, Roz.\nRoz: Oh, there you are. I brought something for Daphne and I was just gonna leave it with the doorman. [Daphne begins to cry]\nFrasier: Oh, lord.\nReset to: Living Room They go in. Daphne heads into the powder room.\nRoz: Did I say something?\nFrasier: Well, actually our doorman, Morrie, passed away this week. We just got back from the funeral.\nRoz: Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. Is she going to be all right?\nFrasier: Well, you know, she's been a little high-strung all week, even before he died. I guess it's just wedding stuff, you know.\nRoz: Yeah.\nDaphne comes back.\nDaphne: Ooh, sorry 'bout that. So, you brought me something, Roz?\nRoz: Well, yeah. I figured you couldn't get married without wearing something borrowed. [Hands her a small box]\nDaphne: Oh! What a beautiful garter! Look at all the lovely detail.\nNiles: I especially like the little odometer.\nRoz backhands him in the stomach as he grins.\nDaphne: Thank you so much, Roz.\nMel: Does anybody besides me feel like a cup of coffee?\nFrasier: Oh, I'll brew a pot.\nMel: Oh, don't be silly. I've been here enough times to know how to get the coffee made. Daphne, make us some coffee. [Then] Kidding!\nNiles laughs. She heads for the kitchen.\nRoz: [picking up a folder] The Wayside Inn. This is where you're having your wedding? Oh gosh, it's just so beautiful.\nDaphne: I hope it is, the planning's been a nightmare. I spent an hour today on the seating charts. Everyone has some demand. \"Don't sit me near the band\", \"Do you mind if I bring a friend?\"...\nRoz: Oh my God, you can't seat me next to him.\nDaphne: Exactly! Every selfish, whiny little thing...\nRoz: No, you cannot seat me next to Tim Walsh. I dated him all last summer and he dumped me.\nDaphne: He's going with my bridesmaid Annie. I have to seat the bridesmaids together.\nRoz: This always happens to me. Is there no place I can go without running into some guy I've dated?\nNiles: I was reading about a Trappist monastery in the Amazon that they somehow built into the treetop.\nRoz: Shut up, ya big doily! This is gonna be awful! Here I am at a wedding, sitting next to a guy who dumped me!\nFrasier: Oh, come on Roz, you won't be alone. You'll be on the arm of a well-known Seattle boulevardier and radio star.\nRoz: Frasier, I can't go with you. I mean, going to a wedding with your boss is like going to the prom with your brother.\nFrasier: Niles and I did not go to the prom together! Our dates were sick and we went stag!\nNiles: In retrospect, yes, we should have canceled the horse-drawn carriage, but hindsight is 20/20.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMEMENTO MORRIE\nScene Two - Frasier's Living Room\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMartin enters carrying a gift bag.\nMartin: Hey, Roz.\nRoz: Hi, Martin. I'm really sorry to hear about your friend Morrie.\nMartin: Oh, thanks. Yeah, his wife just did the nicest thing. I guess she knew Eddie and I'd stop by and shoot the breeze with him, so she gave us something to remember him by.\nFrasier: Oh, well. [Reading the tag] \"For Martin and Eddie.\" Gee, isn't that nice?\nMartin: Yeah, I think it's some kinda wine.\nFrasier: Well, yes I'd say so, but...\nHe pulls out the bottle, reads the label, and gasps.\nFrasier: My God, Dad! This is a 1945 Chateau Petrus!\nMartin: Oh, yeah? She said he got it from his uncle who was in France after the war.\nFrasier: Well, it's one of the rarest bottles in the world!\nMartin: Well, if you're good, maybe Eddie'll give you a glass out of his half.\nMartin exits to the kitchen as Niles comes over to examine the bottle.\nNiles: I've never even seen a '45 Petrus!\nRoz: Oh, poor Morrie. He probably waited his whole life for an occasion special enough to open that bottle.\nFrasier: Yes. Perhaps this should be a lesson for us all. Morrie might be standing guard at the door to heaven right now, but he's buzzing us with one last message: Live life now. I'm reminded of a parable...\nKnock on the door.\nDaphne/Niles/Roz: Come in!\nThe door opens and Simon (Daphne's obnoxious brother) enters with a duffel bag.\nDaphne: Simon!\nSimon: Hello, sis.\nDaphne: I thought you were in California.\nSimon: Yeah, well, those friends I went to surprise were out of town. So I decided to housesit for 'em, which was lovely. 'Til they came home last night. I don't know what all the screaming was about, I was the one in the tub! Where should I put this bag?\nFrasier: By the door so you don't forget it when you leave.\nSimon: Right. I think I know everyone here. [spots Roz] Or do I? And what would your name be then, Miss?\nRoz: Simon, you low-life idiot! You made a date with me last week and you stood me up!\nShe crosses toward the door.\nSimon: Sorry, love, I need a bit more to go on.\nRoz: Maybe this'll refresh your memory.\nShe slams the door in his face.\nSimon: Roz! Of course!\nMartin: [entering from kitchen] Well, look who's back!\nSimon: Well, who's this then? I'd say it was Marty Crane, but he's a bit too young and trim, eh?\nMartin: Oh, go on! Can I offer you a beer?\nSimon: Oh, I hate to drink alone, could I have a sandwich with that?\nMartin and Simon exit to the kitchen.\nFrasier: If that beer-swilling boomerang thinks he's staying here, he's got another thing coming.\nNiles: Better get a move on, he's already got your address on his duffel bag.\nThe phone rings, Daphne gets it and goes to her room. Mel enters from the kitchen with a cup of coffee.\nMel: We'd better get going if we're going to reach the cabin by dark.\nFrasier: Cabin?\nNiles: Yes, Mel and I are celebrating our six-month anniversary by taking a little mid-week getaway to her friend's country place.\nMel: Yes, no phones, no stress, just two days of rest and relaxation. I do have to pick up a little anniversary gift, though, so give me nine minutes and pick me up at the northwest corner of Pike and Elm at 4:42.\nMel and Niles refer to their watches.\nMel: Coming up on 4:33...\nNiles: Synchronizing...\nMel: Now! [Then] Good, I'm relaxing already.\nShe kisses Niles and leaves. Martin and Simon enter from the kitchen.\nSimon: Thank you Marty, it's most hospitable of you.\nMartin: Well, you gotta have a place to stay...\nFrasier: Stop right there! He cannot stay here! The man is loud, ill-mannered, and the last time he stayed here he killed a ficus tree on the downstairs neighbor's balcony by means which are best left to the imagination!\nMartin: Frasier, I invited Simon to stay in my Winnebago! Come on Simon, I'll show you your new digs.\nFrasier: Oh, lord. Simon, you know I...\nSimon: Oh, no, forget about it. It's no worse than what I was just sayin' about you in the kitchen.\nFrasier: [chuckles] Good one.\nSimon: [sotto to Martin] He thinks I'm joking.\nSimon and Martin leave.\nNiles: Join me in a sherry, Frasier?\nFrasier: Oh, I think I will, Niles.\nNiles: You know, I have to admit, I'm a little bit nervous about this trip. I have a feeling Mel may make another push for us to live together.\nFrasier: Oh, my.\nNiles: She's been bringing it up quite a bit lately. She says it's a good way for us to test our relationship.\nFrasier: You're afraid you'll discover things about each other that you won't like?\nNiles: Oh, no. No, no. We're past that stage. She knows my likes and dislikes. I've come attuned to her various quirks... eccentricities... bugaboos.... bκte noirs... night terrors. It's the fun of being in love. I don't know what's bothering me.\nFrasier: Is it possible that your foot-dragging might have anything to do with some lingering feelings for Daphne?\nNiles: Frasier, uh, you must realize I put that behind me months ago.\nFrasier: Just asking.\nNiles: I'm very happy with Mel.\nFrasier: Well then, what's your problem?\nNiles: Uh, well, let's see. I just got through with a rough divorce. I do have a tendency to be overly cautious...\nFrasier: This could be a chance to change all that.\nNiles: So you're in favor of it?\nFrasier: Well, I've never really been the president of the Mel fan club, but she does seem to make you happy. And as we were reminded this morning, life is not to be taken in baby steps. Ask not for whom the doorman buzzes...\nNiles: Thank you. All right. That was much-needed therapy.\nHe gets up to leave.\nFrasier: Well, it was my pleasure. You're my brother, you get the family rate.\nMartin comes in as Niles gets to the door.\nMartin: Hey, guys. Got all the way down to the Winnebago and realized I had the wrong keys.\nNiles: See you guys in a couple of days.\nMartin: All right.\nNiles leaves, Daphne enters from her room on the phone.\nDaphne: You don't say, mum. Your phlebitis again? She looks pleadingly at Frasier and holds the phone out.\nFrasier: [bellowing] Daphne!\nDaphne: Got to go now, mum, Dr. Crane's on the warpath again. Bye. [Hangs up, then to Frasier] Thank you!\nMartin: Daph, I'm glad you're here, because I was thinking about that wine of Morrie's. You know, that's something really for a special occasion. So, I'd like you to have for the wedding, enjoy it on your honeymoon.\nDaphne: [starting to cry] Oh, Mr. Crane!\nShe hugs him and cries on his shoulder.\nMartin: Oh, Daphne, come on. Come on now, it's only a bottle of wine. I don't even know that much about it. Frasier? Help me out here, will you?\nFrasier: Well Dad, Chateau Petrus is a premier crux Bordeaux...\nMartin: No, no, no. No, I mean with Daphne.\nFrasier comes over and holds Daphne.\nMartin: There you go.\nFrasier: Oh, Daphne.\nMartin leaves.\nDaphne: I'm sorry to get so emotional like this.\nFrasier: It's all right. The funeral must've really upset you.\nDaphne: It's not that. Dr. Crane? I've wanted to talk to you about this all week, but I haven't known what to say. You promise you'll keep this just between us?\nFrasier: Of course.\nDaphne: It's about your brother. You see, I know.\nFrasier: Know what?\nDaphne: I know about his feelings for me.\nFrasier: My God! How did you find out?\nDaphne: It's not important.\nFrasier: Somebody blabbed, didn't they? Why can't people just mind their own business? Who was the nattering gossip? Roz? Dad?\nDaphne: You.\nFrasier: What?\nDaphne: You were taking those pills for your back and you blurted it out while I was giving you a massage.\nFrasier: Oh, well, they were very strong pills, you see...\nDaphne: Needless to say, it completely took my breath away. At first, I tried to forget about it, put it out of my mind.\nFrasier: Well, the bottle said just to take one, but I'm a big man...\nDaphne: Oh, will you shut up about those pills?!\nFrasier: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\nDaphne: Anyway, after a while, I couldn't put it out of my mind anymore. I find myself thinking about him all the time.\nFrasier: Daphne... are you saying that you have feelings for Niles?\nDaphne: I think I do. Oh, I don't know! Even if I did, he may not feel that way about me anymore, he's with Mel now!\nFrasier: I-I don't know what to tell you, Daph. Uh, I, I, think the best thing is for you to, to try to find a way to talk with Niles.\nDaphne: Ugh. That's not an easy conversation to have.\nFrasier: It's easier now than after you're married.\nDaphne: You're right, I have to talk to him. And right away. I'm already making myself sick over this. If I leave it any longer, I'll be a complete basket case. Uh, did he mention if he was going home?\nFrasier: Well, ah, actually, um, ah, he's going, ah, somewhere else first. Um...\nDaphne: Where?\nCUT TO: the hallway. Martin and Simon are getting off the elevator.\nMartin: Get you some towels and you'll be all set down there.\nSimon: Right.\nThey enter the apartment, Daphne is again sobbing on Frasier's shoulder.\nMartin: Oh, geez, Daphne! It's just a bottle of wine!\nEND OF ACT ONE\nACT TWO\nABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FATTER\nScene One - Frasier's Living Room. The doorbell rings.\nDaphne: [v.o.] I'll get it!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDaphne is in the apartment, eating cookies from a large bag. She puts the bag down, composes herself... and opens the door to reveal Frasier holding a lot of packages.\nDaphne: Oh. Dr. Crane! I didn't even know you'd gone out. I thought you might be your brother.\nFrasier: Well, I went down to get the mail and got all these wedding gifts for you. But don't worry, Niles called and said he'd be coming by this afternoon.\nDaphne: [picking up the bag and eating another cookie] I don't even know how I'm going to begin this conversation.\nFrasier: Well, I'm sure those chocolate-chip blackened teeth'll be a nice icebreaker.\nDaphne: I've been so nervous lately, I've done nothing but stuff myself with junk food.\nFrasier takes the bag and the doorbell rings.\nDaphne: Oh, it's him!\nFrasier: All right, all right, fine. You're gonna be just fine. Okay? Remember to speak from the heart.\nShe goes to the door, composes herself... and opens the door to Martin.\nDaphne: Mr. Crane!\nMartin: Thanks! Eddie started doing his \"I don't know how much longer I can hold this\" dance and I just ran out without my keys. Have you ever seen him do that dance?\nFrasier: Just the droll impression of it you do at parties, Dad.\nDaphne: [again eating cookies] You know, Mr. Crane, Eddie seems awfully fidgety. I don't think he got enough exercise on that walk.\nMartin: Anybody needs any exercise, it's you, the way you're eating now. You know, when they put \"Party Size\" on that cookie bag, they don't mean party of one.\nThe doorbell rings again. Frasier takes the bag and Daphne composes herself again  then opens the door to Simon.\nDaphne: Simon! What do you want?\nSimon: Well, I've just come to borrow a pen so I can fill out this job application.\nFrasier: What? Oh, you're applying for work? Well here, allow me. [Gives him a pen] Gosh, we'll miss you around here, but onward and upward! [laughs] So, what's the job?\nSimon: Doorman.\nFrasier gasps and staggers, as Daphne supports him.\nFrasier: Dear God.\nSimon: Well, it's ideal for me, really. Nice cozy chair, plenty of time to think the long, long thoughts of youth. Not to mention what the uniforms do for the ladies, ah? [laughs] If memory serves, a certain bellhop back in Manchester found that out with a young lady who will remain nameless.\nDaphne: Simon! [to Frasier] I tell you, I'm this close to just poppin' him one!\nFrasier: Now, now Daphne. Daphne, you just have to calm down. Here, have a cookie. [Gives her the bag, she eats one]\nSimon: What is up with your appetite lately? What, are you knocked up or somethin'?\nDaphne: Of course not!\nShe storms toward him, Frasier grabs her.\nSimon: Now, now, you wouldn't be the first person in our family to be walking down the aisle carrying more than just a bouquet.\nDaphne lunges at him, with Frasier holding her back. The doorbell rings again.\nFrasier: Uh, Simon, why don't you finish filling that out in the kitchen and help yourself to a beer?\nSimon: Well, great!\nHe goes to the kitchen. Frasier takes the bag as Daphne composes herself again... and opens the door to-\nDaphne: Roz!\nRoz: Hi, guys! Hey, Frasier? I felt kinda bad about the other day, dumping you as my wedding date...\nFrasier: You want me back, don't you?\nRoz: And I'm sick about it. But I can't find anybody else.\nFrasier: Sorry Roz, I already invited somebody else, she's driving up on Saturday to join me.\nRoz: Well, get rid of her! I need a date! I'm desperate!\nSimon enters from the kitchen with a beer.\nSimon: Well, well, somebody here is singin' my favorite song.\nRoz: Simon? There's a guy who lives in the park across the street from me. He wears a cat suit and meows at people. If he's busy, maybe I'll call you.\nSimon: I'm prettying myself up, just in case. Speaking of which, Daphne, I borrowed your blow dryer for my job interview.\nDaphne: I spent an hour looking for that! I thought I was losing my mind!\nSimon: Well, that does happen to women in your condition. You know, in the family way.\nMartin: [entering] You're pregnant?\nDaphne: I AM NOT PREGNANT!\nSimon: What, just another scare, then? Like that time back in school with that Pakistani chap?\nDaphne: [lunges at him] Right, that's it, you pig!\nRoz ducks out of the way. Frasier gets in front of her, scoops her over his shoulder and heads for the door.\nDaphne: Oh, put me down!\nFrasier: Daphne and I are going out for a breath of fresh air, perhaps retrieve her blow dryer. Oh, if Niles should happen to stop by, keep him here. There's something important I need to discuss with him.\nHe is going out into the hall as he says this.\nReset to: Hallway He shuts the door.\nDaphne: Oh, for God's sake, put me down!\nFrasier: Not until you promise not to kill your brother.\nThe elevator opens, he goes in and puts her down. There is a neighbor with a basket of laundry next to them.\nDaphne: Oh, all right! It's not as if he doesn't deserve it, telling everyone I'm carrying Donny's baby! Like I don't have enough to worry about today, waiting for Dr. Crane.\nFrasier: Daphne, Daphne, you have to calm down.\nDaphne: It's not easy. I don't even know how to begin with him. \"Would you like steak or salmon at my wedding? And by the way, I think I might be in love with you.\"\nFrasier: You'll find the words when the time comes, all right? [Glares at the neighbor] And don't pretend you're not listening, Mrs. Richman! Your laundry is not that interesting.\n[N.B. Mrs. Richman is Doris from [5.09], Perspectives on Christmas.]\nBack in the apartment, Roz is on the phone.\nRoz: Oh, come on George, I'm desperate here. I promise you a good time. I mean a REALLY good time, if you get my drift. [Pause] You might have mentioned I was on speaker-phone!\nShe disconnects.\nSimon: Listen to what you're doing, Roz. It's not very dignified, is it?\nMartin: Come on Roz, give Simon a chance.\nRoz: So he can stand me up again?\nSimon: And miss my sister's wedding? Never! If you're worried about my appearance, I know where I can get my hands on some very nice Armani suits.\nMartin: Or you could just grab one out of Frasier's closet.\nRoz: What did you think he was talking about? All right. But Simon, just remember my ex-boyfriend will be there. If anybody asks, you're an internet millionaire.\nSimon: Right. I'll be the perfect, well-bred, up-market gentleman. Now, I'll walk you to the garage.\nRoz: Ah, you don't have to.\nSimon: No, it's no bother. I live there.\nThey go to the door and open it to find (at last!) Niles. He is wearing a large grin.\nNiles: Roz!\nRoz: Niles.\nNiles: Simon!\nSimon: Well, by the look of that smile on your face, I'd say somebody got himself a bit last night. [gestures lewdly with arms]\nNiles: [looking shocked and appalled] I find that remark rude, boorish and IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY! [Breaks out laughing]\nSimon: Brilliant!\nSimon gives Niles a punch in the arm, knocking him back into the hallway. Roz just looks disgusted as they leave. Niles comes in.\nMartin: Niles, how was your trip?\nNiles: Oh, fantastic, Dad. Where's Frasier? I have some news.\nMartin: He'll be back in a bit. What's up?\nNiles: Oh, well, uh, I should wait for Frasier, it was really his idea. Do you mind?\nMartin: I can wait.\nNiles: Okay, I can't!\nMartin: What is it?\nNiles: I'm married!\nBeat.\nMartin: Married?\nNiles: Yes, Mel and I eloped yesterday. [Martin is stunned] Well?\nMartin: [gets up to hug him] Well... congratulations, son! That's great. So, uh, you're happy, right?\nNiles: Oh, happy? I'm delirious!\nMartin: Yeah, you'd have to be, wouldn't you? So, you say this was Frasier's idea?\nNiles: Well, indirectly, yeah. Oh, oh, before I forget: it occurred to me, I think we should keep this from Daphne and Donny. I would hate for them to think we were stealing their thunder.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nFrasier comes in.\nFrasier: Oh, Niles.\nNiles: Frasier, three guesses what I did yesterday...\nFrasier: What?\nDaphne enters behind him (with her blow dryer).\nNiles: Daphne.\nDaphne: Dr. Crane.\nNiles: [to Martin] Oh, send Daphne away.\nDaphne: [to Frasier] Get rid of your father.\nMartin: Daphne, could you go to the drugstore? I'm all out of liniment and my back's gettin' kinda achy.\nFrasier: You know, Dad, that's because you've been sitting in that chair all day. I'll tell you what, you know what you could use? A good walk to the drugstore. Do you a world of good. I'll go with you.\nFrasier grabs Martin's arm and cane and starts dragging him to the door.\nMartin: Well, okay, all right. Niles, why don't you come too?\nNiles: Yeah, we'll all go. [He starts to follow]\nFrasier: No, no, there's something very important I need to discuss with Dad, Niles. I'm sure you understand.\nMartin: Fras...!\nFrasier slams the door behind them. Niles and Daphne look at each other a moment and then Niles's cell phone goes off.\nNiles: Oh, excuse me. [Answers phone] Hello? Mel, darling! Oh, just hanging out with Daphne.\nCUT TO: the hallway. Frasier and Martin are waiting for the elevator.\nFrasier: Honestly Dad, when will you learn to take a hint?\nMartin: I can't take a hint? Couldn't you see that Niles wanted to talk to you?\nThe elevator opens and they get on. Mrs. Richman is there, without the basket, apparently going back for another load.\nFrasier: Well, whatever it is, it can wait.\nMartin: Oh, yeah! No big deal, he just got married, that's all!\nFrasier: What?\nMartin: He eloped with Mel yesterday.\nRichman: Poor Daphne...\nFrasier: Would you please keep out of this, Mrs. Richman? We have got to get back up there. [Stabs at the buttons]\nMartin: We're going to the basement.\nFrasier: I can't wait that long!\nThe doors open on a lower floor. Frasier runs around the corner to the stairs.\nCUT BACK TO: the living room.\nNiles: [on phone] I'll see you later, darling. [Hangs up] Sorry about that.\nDaphne: It's all right.\nNiles sits down on the couch.\nNiles: So, forty-eight hours 'til the big day, you must be pretty excited.\nDaphne: It's funny you should mention that. [Sits on the couch beside him] You see, Dr. Crane...\nNiles: Yes, Daphne?\nFrasier: [bursts through door] NILES!\nNiles and Daphne stand up in shock; Frasier freezes in the door, wondering if his entrance was precipitous.\nDaphne: Dr. Crane! You're back awfully soon!\nNiles: You're all out of breath, is something wrong?\nFrasier: Ah, no, no. It's just there's something I need to discuss with Niles.\nDaphne: What, now? We were just having a chat!\nFrasier: Well I'm sure it can wait.\nNiles: Actually Daphne, I need to talk to Frasier, too. If you don't mind.\nDaphne: Oh! Of course not! It's not like I have anything important to talk about!\nShe storms off to her room, grabbing the bag of cookies on her way. Martin comes in behind Frasier.\nNiles: Daphne all right?\nFrasier: Well, uh, it's just wedding stuff, I guess. Speaking of which, I understand you have some, some news? You're married?\nNiles: Yes. I guess Dad couldn't contain himself any more than I could.\nFrasier: Well, I thought you were just gonna move in together.\nNiles: Well, so did I! But then the strangest thing happened. As we talked about it, we got more and more excited about the idea of being together. And then I remembered your advice.\nMartin gives Frasier a very hooded look right here.\nNiles: To stop taking baby steps through life. Before we knew it, we were asking the waitress for a phone book so we could find a justice-of-the-peace.\nThe doorbell rings, Martin gets it.\nFrasier: Well, what can I say, but... congratulations.\nNiles: Thank you!\nThey hug. Martin opens the door, it is Mel with a bottle of champagne.\nMel: Martin! Or should I say \"Dad\"?\nMartin: [nervous] Yeah, I heard.\nFrasier: Mel.\nDaphne comes out of her room behind Niles.\nNiles: Darling... oh, darling, it occurred to me that perhaps we should keep this quiet from Daphne.\nDaphne: Keep what quiet?\nMel: Oh, we can't keep something like this a secret! [takes Niles's hand] We got married!\nDaphne: [freezes for a second, then] Did you?\nBehind Niles and Mel, Frasier looks heartsick.\nNiles: Yes, while we were out of town. But the last thing we want is to upstage you and Donny, so we are not mentioning this outside this room.\nMel makes a little lip-locking gesture.\nDaphne: [coming to them and taking each of their hands] Well, I am just so happy for you both.\nNiles: We're having champagne. Would you like to join us?\nDaphne: Oh, I'd love to. But I have to get a check down to the caterers, they're closing early today.\nFrasier: Let me drive you over, Daphne.\nDaphne: Oh, no, I'm fine. Congratulations again. Oh, save a glass for me.\nCUT TO: the hallway. She goes out into the hallway. We follow as she pushes the button for the elevator. Her shoulders shake with sobs she is holding back.\nAs the elevator doors open, her face breaks and she lets out a sob. Mrs. Richman is standing there with her basket. She puts it down, opens her arms and takes Daphne into a hug to cry on her shoulder.\nEND OF ACT TWO\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

He seems like a bit of a loose end. I'd leave the country, but that's entirely up to you.\nWynn: Are we finished?\nRaylan: As long as you understand that the next time we have this conversation, there won't be a conversation.\nAva: Devil, you want sugar? [ Gasps ] Devil!\nDickie: Hello, Ava.\nAva: Oh!\nDickie: It's the top of the 1st, Raylan. Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter, batter...\nBoyd: Cut him down. Now, God damn it.\nDickie: Wait, Raylan! Come on. Listen to me. You ain't getting to Loretta without me, and you know it.\nRaylan: Boyd?\nBoyd: He shot Ava.\nRaylan: I'm gonna need him for a little bit.\nBoyd: What, are you asking me... Or are you telling me?\nRaylan: Makes you feel better, you can tell people I asked.\nWinona: I want you to leave this alone. I want you to leave it to the authorities. This is not your problem, Raylan.\nRaylan: I promise you I will be fine.\nWinona: Okay. Take me to work. And go to Harlan. But I can't promise you I'm gonna be here when you get back.\nRaylan: I need you and your boys to put your guns down.\nDoyle: And why would we do that?\nRaylan: Maybe you don't want to see your brother's brains fly Guys! Cease fire!\n[ Siren chirps ]\nWinona: Was I speeding?\nWinona Hawkins?\nWinona: Yeah. Ma'am, this is a courtesy stop. Chief deputy Art mullen's been trying to reach you.\n[ Indistinct talking over P.A. ]\nWinona: Hi.\nArt: Hey.\nWinona: How is he?\nArt: He's sleeping right now.\nBut he's gonna be all right. The bullet went right through his side, just under the ribs. Didn't hit any vitals. He's a lucky son of a gun.\nWinona: Look, Art, I, um... Um...\nArt: End of the hall, Winona. First door on the left.\n[ Monitor beeping ]\n[ Gunshots ]\n[ Shell casings dropping ]\nRaylan: [ Sighs ]\n[ Exhales deeply ]\n[ Whirring ]\n[ Whirring stops ]\n[ Sighs ]\n[ Grunts ]\n[ Inhales sharply ]\nI even tried a cross-pull. I don't think I've done that since Glynco.\nArt: How'd that work for you?\nRaylan: Won't be doing it again.\nArt: [ Laughs ] Did you try lefty?\nRaylan: So I could shoot the side of a barn?\nArt: All right, we'll try one more week of medical restriction, and then I'll issue you some hand grenades. You're a lucky man, Raylan.\nRaylan: I got shot, Art.\nArt: Only thing that saved you was all that body fat you got going on there.\nRaylan: Starting to feel uncomfortable.\nArt: Why? We're alone. Crowder's here.\nRaylan: Didn't wear your suit.\nBoyd: Boy, you say that as if I've only got the one and not a whole closet full.\nRaylan: [ Chuckles ] I'm sorry. You didn't wear your black suit.\nBoyd: Well, I can see by the hitch in your step you're still not 100%.\nRaylan: Yeah. How's Ava?\nBoyd: She's moving not so different from you. She's healing. So was I right not to wear my suit?\nRaylan: Well, we don't have a strict dress code.\nBoyd: Well, it just occurred to me that Raylan Givens invites me up to Lexington. Chances are I might find myself in front of a judge before the day is out.\nRaylan: Why? Did you do something you shouldn't have?\nBoyd: Well, that's a pretty low bar, Raylan.\nRaylan: [ Laughs ] Nah, trooper Tom Bergen, up there in your world, he says within a day of Mags killing herself, all her marijuana-drying sheds got cleaned out.\nBoyd: I wasn't aware that marijuana interdiction fell under the marshals' purview.\nRaylan: He also said that the floorboards in the sheds had been torn up, ceilings pulled down, walls opened up, like someone was looking for something, which does fall under the marshals' purview... Recovering ill-gotten gains. Mags' bank accounts have been seized along with her property, but there's still a sizeable amount of money missing.\nBoyd: How sizeable, Raylan?\nRaylan: Well over $10.\nBoyd: Well, now, if I found that kind of money, I'd be in Mexico by now.\nRaylan: Boyd, I've been to Mexico. I don't think you'd like it.\nBoyd: How so?\nRaylan: There's a lot of Mexicans.\nBoyd: Raylan, if a book could only be judged by its cover, you'd be a best seller.\nRaylan: Hmm.\nBoyd: Are we done?\nRaylan: Looks like. Sorry for wasting your time.\nBoyd: Never a waste of time to spend a moment with my good friend Raylan Givens. Tell you what. I'll ask around. See if I can't get a line on that money for you.\nRaylan: I appreciate it.\nBoyd: In exchange for an apology.\nRaylan: I'm sorry. What?\nBoyd: I want you to apologize.\nRaylan: For the crack about the Mexicans?\nBoyd: By the time I got out of Wade Messer's house, Dickie Bennett was tuning you up like it was his birthday and you were his piñata, only I don't think there would have been candy pouring out.\nRaylan: You're saying you saved my life.\nBoyd: Are you saying I didn't?\nRaylan: I would suggest what you're looking for is a \"thank you,\" not an apology.\nBoyd: Well, now, follow my logic, Raylan. I had my own plans for Dickie on account of his shooting Ava, but you said you needed him, so I let you have him under the condition that you would return him to me once his services had been rendered.\nRaylan: [ Scoffs ]\n[ Sighs ]\nI'm sorry. Did you see a creek out in the lobby? Some pretty green trees and cut-off mountains? Do you think we're in the \"har\"? I am a deputy U.S. Marshall, Boyd.\nBoyd: You're a Givens, Raylan.\nRaylan: And you think I'm gonna hand a man over to you to be murdered like he is, what, some pig I borrowed from you?\nBoyd: You gave me your word.\nRaylan: I got half a mind to kick...\nBoyd: [ Grunts ]\nArt: R-a-y-l-a-n.\n[ Grunting in distance ]\nRecovering from a GSW.

This is great country. Ooh!\n[ Laughs ]\nFirst time, and I already love it here. The way the pastures roll off into the distance. The horses... I have never seen such beautiful horses. Thank you. Thank you. May I sit? Please. Two coffees. Now, you want a little kick? Mr. Arnett likes a little kick. Oh, yeah, he'll have a little kick. No. He won't. Just black. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Thank you, Yvette. You can go now.\n[ Sighs ]\nYou're banging her, aren't you? I beg your pardon? And now you've lost her respect. That's hardly your concern. Well, in a way it is. See, she's your public face, and she is not selling the same story as you are.\n[ Clears throat ]\nUh... Who's he? Oh, Mr. Nix is one of my brokers. Could he sit where I could see him?\n[ Laughs ]\nThat's good. Now, why don't you state your business, enjoy your coffee, and then get the hell out? Detroit is concerned. Look, when you go back to Detroit, you just tell them that the properties that I'm holding are poised to rebound, and when they do, they're gonna be worth twice what I paid for them. Wow. So, what do you think they're worth right now, today? No, I don't really have a current assessment. That's okay. 'Cause I do. You picked a shitty time to get into commercial real estate, and now you're under water. Detroit did not make an investment, Emmitt. It made a loan, which you assured them that you would repay as per the agreement. 250 will bring you current. I could have that in two weeks. Emmitt, you read the business pages. Things are getting...Tough all over. So, if you can't have the money here by tomorrow, I suggest you tell me right now.\n[ Sighs ]\nI'll have it tomorrow. That's great. I'll see you tomorrow. Said you were looking for work. Everybody's been wondering what happened to all that Bennett weed.\nDevil: And you get first crack at it, courtesy of Mr. Boyd Crowder. Just his way of showing his appreciation for a new business partner. Well, let's get to it, then.\nArlo: There's more in the tractor shed out back. Lee! Go take a look! A-Ron. Get over here and help me.\nArlo: Devil.\nDevil: Yeah?\nArlo: Ava's here.\n[ Bird squawking ]\nDevil: Ava.\nAva: Devil.\nArlo throwing a party?\n[ Both chuckle ]\nDevil: No, we, uh, got a buyer for the pot.\nRodney Dunham.\nAva: \"Hot rod\" Dunham? Out of Memphis?\nDevil: Now, we're taking care of this, Ava... me, Arlo, and Johnny.\nAva: Yeah?\nDevil: Yeah.\nAva: I don't see Johnny.\nDevil: Well, he'll turn up.\nAva: Yeah? You figure Boyd's locked up, you'll just go into business for yourself.\nDevil: Ah, it ain't like that. Boyd allowed us how he might sell it. We're just acting on his behalf.\nAva: Mm.\nArlo: Dunham wants a word.\nAva: Tell him to come on out.\nArlo: Come on out, Dunham.\nDevil: I got this, Ava. Ooh! Aah, that smell can really take the wind right out of you.\nArlo: Tell me about it.\nAva: Mr. Dunham, Ava Crowder. I'm proud to know you, ma'am.\nAva: Likewise. I've seen all I need to see.\nDevil: Oh, yeah? What's your offer? All I got to offer is advice... next time you want to pull a big score like this, don't bag the plants wet.\nDevil: What, is there a problem? How long's this been sitting here?\nArlo: About three weeks. You got mold, you got mildew, you got rats and mice eating on it out in the shed.\nDevil: Are you saying it's all gone to sh1t? That's not what I'm saying. [ Sighs ] I'm saying you can probably salvage...Two or three grand if you get to cleaning right now.\nDevil: No, this is 120 kilos of premium weed! Three weeks ago...Maybe.\nAva: We were thinking that we might...\nDevil: I'm talking to the gentleman.\nArlo: Let us handle it, Ava.\nDevil: Now, you as much as told me on the phone that you was gonna take the whole lot. I told you I'd look at it.\nDevil: No, no, unh-unh, no, no, no, no. Here's how it works. You want to keep buying quality bud, you gonna have to take all this off our hands.\nAva: Devil!\nDevil: Stay out of this! Pull your head out of your ass, son. This is serious weight, and these are dangerous times. Now, you want this to get ugly? It can.\nAva: Of course that's not what we want, Mr. Dunham. We appreciate you coming by. You're lucky I was already in Knoxville. If I'd come eight hours from Memphis for this , I'd be obliged to kick somebody's ass!\nDevil: Mm-hmm.\nAva: Understandable, sir. Thank you. Ma'am.\n[ Vehicle doors open, close ]\nAva: [ Sighs ]\nThat go about the way you expected?\nArlo: I could use a drink.\nDevil: Amen to that.\nAva: [ Sighs ]\nWinona: You know you got 21/2 bottles of whiskey on ice and no beer?\nRaylan: That can happen. Wait. You can't drink any of that sh1t anyway.\nWinona: Well, I can have one.\nRaylan: Who says?\nWinona: My mom. She used to have a couple drinks a night when she was carrying me. She'd put her ashtray, balance it on her great big belly.\nRaylan: That explains a lot.\nWinona: [ Chuckles ] How you doing?\nRaylan: I've been better.\nWinona: Well, you still look good.\nRaylan: What do you mean, \"still\"?\nWinona: You are not getting any younger, kiddo.\nRaylan: I'm so glad you're here.\nWinona: You ready to get back in action?\nRaylan: Oh, Art said another week of light duty, and that was before the fight.\nWinona: That's not what I'm talking about.\nRaylan: [ Moaning, grunting ]\nWinona: You okay? Did that hurt?\nRaylan: I'll manage.\n[ Both moaning and grunting ]\nRaylan: [ Breathes deeply ]\nWinona: So, what's going on?\nRaylan: What are you asking?\nWinona: I just... it feels like there's something on your mind.\nRaylan: Do you know about the newborn baby in the delivery room?\nCalls his daddy over and says, \"how do you think that feels?\"\nWinona: Is that what you were thinking about?\nRaylan: Maybe a little.\nWinona: You know the baby's the size of a walnut right now, don't you?\nRaylan: Mm-hmm. You know it's gonna get bigger, too, right?\nRaylan: W-well, yeah.\nRaylan: Mm. Maybe we need more room.\nWinona: [ Sighs ] After all the time I spent redecorating?\nRaylan: Well, much as I appreciate you putting lipstick on this particular platypus...\nWinona: [ Laughs ] Raylan:...Maybe we should... I don't know... start looking for a house or something.\nWinona: Mm...And leave all this?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Doorbell rings ]\nYeah? [ Shakily ] I got a large olive and eggplant. [ Chuckles ] Sorry, son, I didn't order a pizza. I did.\n[ Sighs ]\n[ Clears throat ]\nWhere would you like me to put them? Put them on the desk and sit. Mm, these are way nicer than the piece of sh1t I wear. But I'm not complaining. Keeps good time. You don't remember me, do you? Never seen you before in my life. Oh, you've seen me. You just didn't notice me. But I know you. You're Delmer Coates. You used to own that watch store over on Clinton. Couple of kids tried to rob you. You shot them. Dumb asses didn't know you had a gun under the counter. Couple other guys tried after that, right? Yeah. You shot and killed four men. You're one tough son of a bitch. But I come in here and ask you for the watches, and you just lay down. Yeah. What was I supposed to do? I was hoping you'd pull on me, give me some lip. You just hit the silent alarm and wait for the cavalry to come. I know all about your security system. I'm the guy who put it in. When I ordered the pizza, I took your security system offline. Took me less than 30 minutes, which is more than I can say for you, slick. You understand why I ain't paying for that pizza, right?\n[ Whimpers ]\nNow, I don't like wearing a mask. I'm too pretty. So I am gonna have to kill you. But I'll tell you what... There's this game I like to play. I'm gonna put this gun between us and have the pizza man count it down from 10. When he gets to 1, we both go for it, so you got the same chance I got. That sounds fair, right? Start counting. I-I don't think I should be inv... be involved in this. Count.\n[ Inhales deeply ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Shakily ] 8...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Screams ]\nI win.\n[ Latches click] [ Gasps ]\nI didn't see anything. I'm not gonna say anything. I swear. Are you gonna eat that pizza? No! Take it!\n[ Breathing heavily ]\n[ Knock on desk ]\nRaylan: What's up?\nTim: Somebody killed a Mr. Delmer Coates last night along with a pizza delivery boy.\nThey also emptied his safe.\nRaylan: I regret their passing. So?\nTim: Well, whoever killed them took Mr. Coates' security system offline, which is not so easy considering...\nRaylan: I'm gonna stop it there. Were either Mr. Coates or the pizza delivery man federal fugitives?\nTim: No, but Fletcher \"the ice pick\" Nix is. He's charged with interstate flight. The stab wounds on the victim's hands are consistent with an ice pick.\nRaylan: Can't help you. I'm on light duty. Maybe Rachel.\nTim: Oh, yeah, I'd rather take her, but, uh...\nRaylan: \"But, uh,\" what?\nTim: Wynn Duffy's security system did the installation.\nRaylan: Is there a question attached to this?\nTim: Well, Duffy's the only lead I got, and I thought you might help me out.\nRaylan: Why would you think that?\nTim: 'Cause you had that thing.\nRaylan: Had what thing?\nTim: Where you two killed Gary together.\nRaylan: That's funny. That's funny. Excuse me. I'm out of staples, and I'm getting a little light on paper clips.\nTim: Come on, man.\nRaylan: \"Come on, man.\" Have you not been listening? I cannot leave my desk.\nTim: Just say you're on lunch.\nRaylan: I can't talk to Duffy.\nTim: Sure you can.\nRaylan: No, I can't.\nTim: Why not?\nRaylan: Last time I saw him I said our next conversation wasn't gonna be a conversation.\nTim: Well, this is a different conversation.\n[ Car door closes ]\nTim: What?\nHe's not gonna remember something you said that long ago.\nRaylan: [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] He doesn't want to talk to you.\nRaylan: Well, that makes two of us.\nWynn: Who don't I want to talk to?\nRaylan: [ Exhales deeply ]\nWynn: Raylan. To what do I owe the pleasure?\nRaylan: Deputy Gutterson has some questions for you.\nTim: Gentleman named Delmer Coates was murdered last night. Name ring a bell?\nWynn: Not offhand. Should it?\nTim: Well, you installed his security system about two years ago. It was a whispertech series \"c.\"\nWynn: That's a good system.\nTim: Whoever killed Coates disabled it first. Since you install so many of them...\nWynn: I'm sorry, I just have to ask. Are you two accusing me of being involved or are you just asking me for information?\nRaylan: Whichever applies.\nWynn: I don't think it'd very good for business if I went around murdering my own clients, do you?\nTim: Well, it might be worth it if they had a safe full of expensive merchandise.\nWynn: All my clients have expensive merchandise. That's why they buy security sys...\nRaylan: Just answer the question, or shut your mouth.\nWynn: I can only imagine how frustrating this must be for you, Raylan. It'd be so much easier to just beat a confession out of me, wouldn't it?\nRaylan: That's still an option.\nWynn: As a matter of fact, as I recall, last time we met, you told me next conversation we had wasn't gonna be a conversation.\nRaylan: This is a different conversation.\nWynn: Oh.\nTim: You ever hire an installer named Fletcher Nix? Favorite toy's an ice pick.\nWynn: That's not exactly standard equipment.\nRaylan: That ain't exactly an answer.\nWynn: Raylan, I am so sorry. I would love to be of more help, but I got to get back to watching women's tennis. Close the door, Mike.\n[ Exhales sharply ]\n[ Door slams shut ]\nRaylan: [ Sighs ]\nWell, the man's a piece of sh1t, but I believe him.\nTim: You do?\nRaylan: He didn't flinch when you mentioned Delmer Coates.\nTim: No, but when I mentioned that ice pick...\nRaylan: Yeah, he flinched a little.\nTim: Well, maybe this one's above his pay grade. Who's he work for?\nRaylan: Emmitt Arnett. Dixie mafia shot-caller out of Frankfort.\nTim: Okay, how about you go talk to him? You drop me off at the corner. I'll keep an eye on Duffy.\nRaylan: Excuse me?\nTim: Or, you know, you can go back to the office, get your paper clips, do the p-p dance, whatever makes you feel happy, Raylan.\n[ Car door closes ]\nRaylan: [ Grunts ]\n[ Engine turns over ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nWynn: [ Sighs ]\nEmmitt, is there anything you want to tell me? What is this, 20 questions?\nWynn: You hired one of my own guys to go after one of my clients? Where'd you get that idea?\nWynn: Don't insult my intelligence, Emmitt! I'm talking about Fletcher, the ice pick. Hey, baby? Baby, pull that door a minute, will you? I didn't think he was still one of your boys.\nWynn: He isn't one of my boys. Do you know why? Because he's a federal fugitive, which means that anything he does points right back at me, which raises the obvious question, was that your intention, Emmitt? No! No, look. [ Sighs ] It d-didn't go as planned. I'm on my way into the office to meet him, and that'll be the end of it.\nWynn: Well, let me know how that goes. And, by the way, Raylan Givens is on his way to talk to you.\n[ Sighs ]\nDamn.\n[ Buzzer sounds ]\nBoyd: Oh, it sure is good to see you.\nAva: You okay?\nBoyd: I'm fine.\nHow are you?\nAva: Well, it sucks talking to you through this glass.\nBoyd: They're transferring me to Tramble. Everything okay?\nAva: [ Inhales deeply ] You know that cord of wood we got stacked behind Arlo's house?\nBoyd: I thought maybe we could sell some.\nAva: Yeah, but your old buddy from Memphis came by, said he couldn't use any of it.\nBoyd: Not a piece?\nAva: Mnh-mnh. He said it was starting to rot. Didn't seem to have any good ideas about what we should do with it, either.\nBoyd: [ Sighs ] Well... [ Inhales deeply ] Burn it.\nAva: All of it?\nBoyd: All of it. I wouldn't want to attract any termites or any other pests.\nRaylan: [ Sighs ]\n[ Cellphone rings ]\nYeah? What's the problem? Uh-huh. Yeah. Small world.\n[ Elevator bell dings ]\nI'll tell you later. You want me to handle it? All right. Have it your way.\nRaylan: Something I can help you with? I like your hat.\n[ Elevator bell dings ]\nRaylan: [ Sighs ]\nThere much call for cowboys these days?\nRaylan: You would be surprised. Yeah?\nRaylan: Yep. Whoa. Hey. It's not your floor. Change of plan. See you again.\nRaylan: Emmitt? Marshal! [ Chuckles ] I didn't hear you come in.\nRaylan: Sorry. Looking for Mr. Arnett. Uh, he won't be coming in today.\nRaylan: [ Sighs ] You know where I can find him? I can try to find out. Or maybe there's something I can do for you. My daddy had a hat kind of like yours.\nRaylan: Oh, yeah? Except the brim was smaller.\nRaylan: Businessman's Stetson. That's it. Can I be honest with you?\nRaylan: I'd like to think so. I don't think Mr. Arnett's in the real-estate business.\nRaylan: What makes you say that? Mostly just the people who come around. I mean, they don't look like real-estate folks. They don't even look like contractors or property managers or maintenance people. They're just sketchy.\nRaylan: Like Wynn Duffy. Exactly! And this new guy, Fletcher Nix. He is super creepy. Ohh.\nRaylan: What do you know about him? Nothing. Except he was supposed to come into the office this morning for a meeting, but Mr. Arnett canceled at the last minute.\nRaylan: Why'd he cancel? Mm. They rescheduled.\nRaylan: Rescheduled for...? Can I just say... It is so nice talking to a man who's interested in what you have to say. I mean, none of Mr. Arnett's colleagues are very good conversationalists, to say the least.\nRaylan: Must be difficult. They rescheduled for...? Tonight. But I don't have to be there. Thank goodness.\nRaylan: Do you know where? Um...Near a cab stand at Jefferson and Main.\nRaylan: Yvette, may I offer you some advice? Quit. The sooner the better. I got a feeling Mr. Arnett's about to ride a barrel over the falls. I wish you could see it, buddy. Hey, you know how they talk about Kentucky bluegrass? Well, it's actually blue. I did... I sent you a postcard this morning. No, I wouldn't kid you about that. Ll see for yourself as soon as I get settled. Hey, look, pop's got to go. I love you, buddy. Bye.\n[ Car door opens ]\nHow'd that go? Just like you said it would. You tell him about tonight? Mm-hmm. But that's what I don't get. If they catch Fletcher before he makes the drop, you don't get the money. Well, I'm not so worried about the money anymore. Then what'd you come all this way for? I like the scenery.\n[ Gear shifts ]\nRaylan: This is Fletcher Nix?\nTim: Didn't you look at his file?\nRaylan: Not closely.\nTim: There a problem?\nArt: Okay, Rachel, I want you to call the LPD shift captain.\nMake sure he has all our info. Tim, you call the S.W.A.T. Team leader and do the same. Now, we're gonna need a photograph of Emmitt Arnett. Something better than a drivers license would be a big plus. Hopefully, we can get Arnett and Fletcher nix together tonight, and it'll be one-stop shopping. All right.\nRaylan: You ain't gonna let me do anything, are you?\nArt: Well, you can't run and you can't shoot. What good are you?\nRaylan: Well, I can be the guy on the radio, telling people what to do.\nArt: That's my job, asshole.\nRaylan: But, Art...\nArt: Not changing my mind.\nRaylan: No, no, no. There's something else you should know.\nArt: Okay.\nRaylan: Tim showed me a picture of Nix this morning, but I didn't look at it.\nArt: Is that it?\nRaylan: And then I ran into him later in the elevator at Arnett's, but I didn't recognize him.\nArt: Because you didn't look at the picture.\nRaylan: Mm-hmm.\nArt: 'Cause you've been shot, and you're off your game, which is why I told you to stay at your desk. So the next time I tell you to stay at your desk...\nRaylan: I'm gonna stay at my desk.\nArt: Thank you.\nRaylan: But this thing tonight...\nArt: Yes?\nRaylan: It might have come too easy... the information I got from Yvette. I didn't have to work hard for it.\nArt: Anything else you screwed up today?\nRaylan: Not that I can think of.\nArt: Go home, Raylan, really. We'll be fine.\nAva: You sure do have some fine cookware, Mr. Givens.\nArlo: Most of it was Helen's. Some from her sister. They both liked to cook.\nAva: As do I.\nArlo: Ava?\n[ Sighs ]\nWhile we appreciate you making this fine meal, I think we would appreciate it even more if you told us what Boyd had to say.\nAva: [ Sighs ]\nDevil: Yeah, why you stalling?\nAva: Well, you got me, Devil. I am stalling. I just wanted to get some good food in you before I relayed Boyd's orders.\n[ Sighs ]\nBoyd instructed that you burn the weed.\nDevil: The hell?\nArlo: That weed's worth 100 grand easy.\nAva: It's also worth 20 years any law enforcement happens by. Hot rod was our last outlet. We can't just sit on it and hope we run into someone who will take it off our hands.\nDevil: We ain't burning it.\nAva: Those were Boyd's orders...\nDevil: Yeah, well, Boyd's not here, is he?\nAva: [ Sighs ] Devil, I can imagine it is hard taking orders from a woman. Only you're not. You're taking orders from Boyd. I'm just passing it along. Now, the way I figure it is you got a choice. We can play nice. You do what Boyd says, and I keep making fine food. My fried chicken is to die for. The other path? You ignore Boyd, and I get ornery.\nDevil: Well, what are you gonna do? Spit in our food.\n[ Both laugh ]\n[ Groans ]\nAva: We clear?!\nI need to make my point any more emphatically?!\nArlo: You didn't need to do that, Ava.\nAva: Of course I did, Mr. Givens. Otherwise I wouldn't have done it.\nDevil: [ Groans ]\nTim: Male, 40s, approaching the Escalade, holding a box.\nArt: Fletcher Nix?\nTim: Negative. Not... repeat, not... Fletcher Nix.\n[ Knock on window ]\nYou're supposed to give me something for this. How about you get in the car or I shoot you in the face.\nTim: Driver's got a gun.\nArt: All right, shut it down! Get in the goddamn car.\nRachel: [ Grunts ]\n[ Sirens wail ]\n[ Gear shifts ]\n[ Tires screech ]\n[ Indistinct shouting ]\nArt: Keep your hands in the air!\nKeep your hands where I can see them at all times! Get out of the car. Put your hands on your head. Turn around. Kneel down.\nRaylan: I've always thought \"Felix\" deserved a comeback. Felix... Felix Givens.\nWinona: Like Felix the cat.\nRaylan: Yeah, but without the cat. Just...Felix. What do you think?\nOn winona: Uh, yeah, maybe.\nRaylan: [ Chuckles ] Maybe, huh?\nWinona: Raylan, I think it's sweet that you think you have a say in the name.\nRaylan: I'm sorry?\nWinona: Well, I do know you, and I know that if I spend more than five minutes in labor, sweating and screaming and all of that, you're gonna go with whatever name I choose. I mean, I could... I could choose jiffy pop or palmolive. That's a good one.\nRaylan: Hmm.\n[ Cellphone ringing ]\nJiffy pop.\nWinona: Jiffy pop.\nRaylan: Jiffy pop for a boy. Palmolive's obviously a girl's name. What's up, Art? How'd it go?\nArt: Not well. Fletcher Nix was a no-show, as was Arnett. Nix sent some homeless guy to do the drop, and arnett sent some guy that might have been a bodyguard, but we don't know now because he's all lawyered up. I thought the homeless guy was gonna get popped, so I shut it down.\nRaylan: What's next?\nArt: Frankfort PD's on the way Arnett's house to bring him in for questioning.\n[ Car beeping ]\n[ Car door closes ]\nWinona: Who are you?\nI'm the one with the gun.\nRaylan: This has nothing to do with the lady. That's too bad. Come inside. Shut the door. Now I ask you to take your gun out. I think you'd do it, considering the company. Slowly. Just take two fingers, and... You know what? Just do whatever you'd tell someone to do in a situation like this. Unh. Whole thing. Put it on the ground.\nRaylan: [ Sighs ]\n[ Grunts ]\nHave a seat.\nRaylan: [ Grunts ] Okay. What's next, Fletcher? Aww, you're showing me you know my name.\nRaylan: I know a lot about you. You didn't know me in the elevator.\nRaylan: What I still don't get is why you don't just take the money and run. Maybe because it's not money. Watches. I look like I know anything about watches?\nRaylan: Hell, I could take those off your hands. Give you 20 apiece for them. You can be on your way.\n[ Chuckles ]\nYou're the one who put that plug in Tommy Bucks on that Miami rooftop.\nRaylan: That's right. How about we play a game?\n[ Chuckles ]\nCount down from 10.\nRaylan: Go ahead, Winona.\nWinona: Right now? This is as good a time as any.\nWinona: Uh...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nWhen she gets to 1, we go for it.\nWinona: 5...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Voice breaking ] 2...\n[ Groans ]\n[ Inhales sharply ]\n[ Groaning ]\nRaylan: I'm sorry about your tablecloth.\nIs that really necessary?\nWynn: I don't know him. He'll be here. He'll be here. Don't worry. No, he won't. Oh, he probably just stopped for a sandwich or something. That boy just can't stop eating. Actually, you know, it's a problem. Mr. Arnett, he's not coming. I had your assistant, Yvette, tell the marshals where the exchange was happening.\n[ Laughs ]\nI'm not joking.\n[ Slams glass ]\nWhy would you do that? You had a good thing going here, Emmitt. But you let go of the rope.\n[ Sighs ]\nYou done? Almost. You know me now? Yeah.\nDewey: I don't know if you're thinking of it, but stay away from the neck. Now, back here's okay, but up here? Hurts like a son of a bitch, and don't mind my saying. I think it might be because the skin is looser or something.\nDickie: Yeah, no no, thank you. I don't plan on getting no tattoos.\nDewey: Well, man, neither did I, but, as much as anything else, it gives you something to do, you know? You can only spank it so much. What the hell's he doing here?\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The text is a dialogue between two characters, Raylan and Winona. Raylan is a law enforcement officer who is questioning Winona about a robbery that took place at her restaurant. Winona is the owner of the restaurant and is reluctant to cooperate with Raylan's investigation. During the dialogue, Winona reveals that she has a friend named Emmitt who is involved in the robbery and that she has arranged for a meeting between Emmitt and the law enforcement officers to exchange the stolen items for a large sum of money. However, Emmitt does not show up for the meeting, and Winona is left with no choice but to cooperate with Raylan's investigation.</s>【我为群众办实事】“我为群众办实事”实践活动—— 市妇联开展“巾帼心向党 奋斗新征程” 主题宣讲活动"

Ok, you Einstein. Me, brain-dead.\nToby: I mean, your parents aren't homesuidal maniacs.\nJT: I thought Kate and Jeff were getting along great.\nToby: I'm not talking about Kate.\nJT: Whoa. Your mom's coming tomorrow? Oh, man. I should sell tickets. Remember that time at camp when they both came to pick you up?\nToby: Don't remind me.\nJT: Can't you just ask your mom not to come?\nToby: Sure, if I want to start a nuclear custody war.\nJT: Maybe they won't start screaming this time.\nToby: Yeah. Maybe Mr. Armstrong will your parents about the \"D\" on your last math test.\nJT: How much time do we have left?\nToby: 28 hours, 13 minutes, and 17 seconds. 28 hours, 13 minutes, and 16 seconds. 28 hours, 13 minutes, and 15 seconds.\nHall\nToby: The way it works now is perfect. Every other weekend with my mom, the rest of the time with my dad. And as long as they don't have to talk to each other, everything's fine.\nJT: Sorry, man. I didn't know it was that serious.\nToby: Yeah, well, it is that serious.\nJT: Hey, we could contaminate the water foundations with E coli, that way they'd have to shut down the school, right?\nToby: There probably is E coli in the foundations.\nMr. S: (as he's taking a drink) Actually, we test our water on a daily basis, boys. It's fine.\n(Bell rings.)\nMr. Simpson's homeroom\nMr. S: Ok guys, quiet down. (JT and Toby come in behind him) We don't have Ashley today, but we do have this week's News About Kids broadcast.\nEmma: Uh, NAK again.\nMr. S: Em? Something you wanna share?\nEmma: No, Mr. Simpson. (She sits down)\n(Mr. Simpson turns on the tv. The NAK people appear on screen.)\nRyan: Hi, I'm Ryan, and this is Nicole. And welcome to NAK: News About Kids. Today we'll be talking about that infests major cities everywhere\nNicole: And we're not talking cockroaches, we're talking squeegee kids.\nRyan: Stalking street corners, waiting to pounce on un suspecting cars. (Shows footage as he talks). Hijacking your hard-earned cash to waste on drugs and tattoos. (Shows Emma watching.)\nNicole: Are squeegee kids legit or lazy? Are they using their \"cool\" trend for today's media saturated youth?\nMr. S: Remember guys, you're here for media studies after lunch.\n(The students leave for class.)\nManny: Em, it was just a TV show.\nLiberty: Squeegee kids are very annoying.\nEmma: No, squeegee kids are poor. They live on the street and wash windows. It's their living.\nLiberty: My father says that if another one of those ragamuffins tries to dirty up his window, he'll call the mayor. He knows the mayor.\n(Liberty walks away.)\nEmma: Last week NAK told us to join the army. What's tomorrow? A hole in the O-Zone is good because it makes a better tan? Imagine being a squeegee kid. Out in the cold, no school, no parents.\nToby: No parents?\nEmma: Toby this isn't a joke. (Starts to walk backwards, so she bumps into Sean.)\nManny: He stared right at you.\nEmma: Yeah, because I bumped right into him.\nGirls' Washroom\n(Ashley is at the mirror looking at her face. Paige and Terri come in.)\nPaige: Oh, here we go again.\nAshley: Here we go what again?\nPaige: Every time NAK claims your airspace, you go all manic-depressive.\nAshley: That is so not true. I just- look at this zit!\nTerri: That's a pore and Paige has a point.\nAshley: Terri...\nTerri: I don't get why you gets so bothered. Everybody loves your morning announcements. Even Heather Sinclair said you were better than those lame-o NAK hosts.\nPaige: Oh, yeah, big accomplishment. They're total freaks.\nTerri: Heather even has an agent. You could totally get an agent.\nPaige: Heather Sinclair has an agent? With that overbite?\nTerri: See? Ashley's got the look and tv experience. It's perfect.\nPaige: Where would Ashley find an agent?\nAshley: Guys, Toby is mom's a casting agent. Terri, you rock!\n(Ashley and Terri leave the bathroom. Paige stays behind to wash her hands. She is not happy.)\nOutside\nToby: JT, come on. We've got to come up with an anti-parents plan.\nJT: What does it look like I'm doing?\nToby: Uh, playing the seeds for a massive heart attack?\nJT: To plot evil, I need energy (Ashley + Terri come up to them)\nAshley: Hey. Just the person I was looking for. Your mom's a casting agent, right?\nToby: Yeah, so?\nTerri: So, is she coming to Parents' Day?\nToby: Thank you, for reminding me.\nAshley: Is that a yes?\nToby: Yeah, why?\nAshley: No reason.\n(They walk away.)\nJT: What was that about?\nToby: I have no idea.\n(They go to a table where Manny and Emma are.)\nManny: It's not like people really think about it.\nEmma: That's the thing. They don't us to think. They want us to become brain-dead NAK robots.\nToby: What's with her?\nManny: NAK rage, kind of like road rage.\nEmma: And the announcements? They have commercials. They're trying to buy our bran loyalty in homeroom.\nJT: Emma, who are you talking to?\nEmma: I could talk, or I could take action.\n(Emma leaves.)\nJT: Imagine being her for a day.\nHall\n(Spinner is walking and talking with Paige.)\nSpinner: Ok, so then the guy goes, \"What are you going to do for a face when the monkey wants its butt back?\" (He laughs, but she doesn't.) What? You don't get it? The guy has a face like a monkey's butt?\nPaige: Spinner, do you think Ashley's prettier than me?\nSpinner: What?\nPaige: Because she's thinking about getting an agent (they sit down).\nSpinner: Oh, Ashley's getting an agent? I could totally see her on TV.\nPaige: What? And you couldn't see me?\nSpinner: I didn't say that.\nPaige: So you think that I could get an agent too, right?\nSpinner: Uh, yeah. Sure, why not? Ok, back to my joke. So then the guy goes...wait, is that the right word? Yeah, no, yeah, yeah. So, then the guy goes... (While he's talking, Paige isn't listening)\nMr. Raditch's Office\nEmma: Mr. Raditch, could I talk to you about this morning's NAK broadcast?\nMr. R: I'm all ears.\nEmma: NAK is totally bias. This morning they tell us squeegee kids suck, and then they tell us which running shoes to buy? It's wrong.\nMr. R: How you seen the new computers in the Media Immersion lab? 18 computers thanks to NAK. In exchange, we show their morning broadcasts.\nEmma: Whatever they want to report?\n(Mr. R nods.)\nEmma: But that's bribery.\nMr. R: No, it's 18 new computers we wouldn't have otherwise. Parents voted for it. And remember, not everyone at Degrassi has a computer at home. But, if you feel strongly about it, write an opinion piece. Make sure you get it in by 4:00. Make the Parents' Day addition.\nEmma: 4:00 today?\nMr. R: Think you can do it?\n(The bell rings. Emma nods as she leaves.)\nHall\n(Ashley and Terri are leaving class.)\nAshley: So, I signed us up for the welcoming committee, Teri. Which means, I'll be the first person Toby's mother sees.\nTerri: Great.\nPaige: Unless she sees me first.\nAshley: What?\nPaige: Well, I am helping out tomorrow.\nAshley: Since when?\nPaige: Ashley, you asked me like, 3 weeks ago to volunteer, remember? Anyway, see you two later.\nMedia Immersion.\nManny: I can't believe the principal is asking you to do this. You're like, attacking the school.\nEmma: I know. It's very cool.\n(They go to sit down, but Sean's stuff is in a seat.)\nManny: I'll stand.\n(Emma nods and sits down.)\nEmma: Ok, so let's try to imagine. You're a squeegee kid.\nManny: Ok. I'm a squeegee kid.\nEmma: So how does it feel being compared to a cockroach?\nManny: I'd say, \"Hey, preppy kids. Get off my case. We're people, too.\"\nSean: Oh, please.\nEmma: Could... We need the chair.\n(Sean gets up and leaves.)\nEmma: Talk about negative energy.\nAnother part of Media Immersion\nToby: Emma's right. I could whine or I could do something about Parents' Day.\nJT: Ok, so, what are you going to do?\nToby: Convince my parents there's no need to show up. Ok, I downloaded the logo from the Degrassi website. Then, I scanned Mr. Simpson's signature from the last newsletter he sent home. It's a masterpiece.\nJT: Masterpiece or insanity. OK, your parents don't have to come because of your exemplary performance in all of your scholastic pursuits. What?\nToby: Translation: I'm acing school. It's all in the details, my friend. This'll work. It has to. Hall\n(Emma is running to the newspaper office to hand in her story.)\nEmma: (knocks on the door) Liberty, my NAK editorial. I just finished.\nLiberty: (checking her watch) You're 17 minutes late.\nEmma: I'm sorry.\nLiberty: The Grapevine deadline is 4 P.M. I'm trying to run a professional operation.\nEmma: Even professional newspapers give extensions. It's 17 minutes.\nLiberty: I suppose I could make an exception for you. But, please try not to get used to it. Remember, as editor, I'm only as strong as my weakest link.\n(Emma gives her the disk and leaves.)\nKerwin House\n(Toby is in the kitchen with his dad.)\nToby: I was shocked more than anyone. Who knew I was doing so well? You know, this transfer to Degrassi has really...\nJeff: \"Uplifted Toby's grade classification to a premium standard.\" Interesting choice of words from Mr. Simpson.\nToby: Well, you know, he's a computer guy. Writing isn't really his thing.\nJeff: Neither is spelling. Two E's in premium. What's going on?\nToby: Nothing's going on.\nJeff: You don't want me to go to Parents' Day?\nToby: I didn't say that.\nJeff: You didn't need to. Are you doing that badly in school or what? Talk to me Toby.\nToby: Mom called, ok? She wants to go tomorrow.\nJeff: And she didn't even tell me. That is so typical of your mother.\nToby: See? You guys can't even be in the same room without freaking out.\nJeff: Toby. We're on much better terms now. It's not like it used to be. So, what you don't want to go?\nToby: I want you to go and I want her to go. I just don't want the two of you to go there... together.\nJeff: Hey, come on buddy. Everything's going to be fine. No fights. Promise. (Holds up his hand)\nDegrassi's Parents' Day\n(As parents head inside, the camera closes up on a sign that says \"Welcome Parents to D.S.C Parents Day\".)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGirls Washroom.\n(Ashley and Terri are in there. Ashley is trying to put on eyeliner.)\nAshley: Look at me. I'm shaking. You do it. (Gives it to Terri, but Terri pokes her in the eye) Ow! Be careful. It's my eye. It's what I see with.\nTerri: Sorry. I'm not good at this.\nPaige: Ladies. (She comes out a stall wearing a yellow sparkly top that's very short)\nAshley: What are you wearing?\nPaige: It's Parents Day. I have the right to look fabulous, don't I?\nAshley: For who, the parents? Or Toby's mom?\nPaige: See you out there.\n(Paige leaves, then Ashley and Terri follow.)\nHall\n(Toby and Jeff are waiting for Toby's mom.)\nToby: Guess she forgot.\nJeff: You know your mother. We'll give her two more minutes. Hey, tobs, it'll be fine.\nAshley: Mrs. Demcowski? Room 102.\nMan: Thank you.\n(Toby's mom comes up to them.)\nTerri: Hi, can I help you?\nAshley: Uh, Terri, this is Toby's mom, the casting agent. Welcome to Degrassi, Ms. Issacs.\nAnnemarie: Hi.\nPaige: Can I just say that that is a great outfit? So avante garde.\nAnnemarie: Thank you. Wholt Rentthrough. On Sale.\nToby: Hi, mom.\nAnnemarie: Hey, tiger. I'm sorry I'm late.\nJeff: Annemarie. Flat tire?\nAnnemarie: I could Toby that I might beheld up at work. Parents Day isn't over already, is it?\nJeff: No, no. We'd better get moving though.\nPaige: Paige Michalchuk. It's very nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you.\nAshley: Smooth, Michalchuk. I bet you're on the next flight to Hollywood.\nPaige: Hon, I'd re-think the eyeliner. You're looking a little washed out.\nMedia Immersion.\n(Toby and his parents are in there, meeting with Mr. Simpson.)\nMr. S: Uh, there's no doubt Toby is a bright kid, but, uh, he has trouble with details, particularly his spelling, some of the basic points of grammar. This tends to bring down his marks. For example, in Media Immersion, Toby could be at the top of his class if he just applied himself.\nToby: \"Apply\" is such a relative term.\nMr. S: Toby, come on. Your last media assignment was 3 days late. He's just not getting the results he should for someone so bright.\nAnnemarie: 3 days late?\nJeff: First I've heard of it. Toby?\nAnnemarie: Jeff, I'm talking to you. This is Parents Day. You're the parent.\nJeff: We're both the parents here and we'll discuss it later, ok?\nAnnemarie: We will discuss it now. Why aren't you helping Toby get his work in on time? Why is he under achieving?\nJeff: Toby and I will work it out. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.\nHall\nSpike: I am so proud of you. Rave review after rave review.\nEmma: Mom, my editorial.\n(Tracker and Sean come out of a room.)\nTracker: So you have to watch this video every morning? Free computers are free computers, man. What idiot wrote this?\nEmma: Excuse me, I wrote that.\nTracker: Oh, sorry.\nEmma: Don't look at her. It's my piece and I'm right. Students shouldn't be force fed advertising while we're at school. If you don't get it, you're the idiot.\nSpike: Emma...\nSean: Look, it's not that serious.\nEmma: What? Expressing my opinion isn't important?\nSean: That's all my brother's trying to do.\nEmma: I could tell, and he's wrong.\nTracker: I'm wrong? Tell me Emma, is it fair or is it wrong that Sean here is falling behind in school because we can't afford a computer?\nEmma: He can do his homework here.\nTracker: What? Yeah, on the free computers.\nEmma: If you read the entire article, you would know...\nTracker: That it's a piece of garbage.\nEmma: It is not garbage!\nTracker: (crumples it up) Looks like garbage to me. Smells like garbage.\nSean: Tracker, man...\nTracker: All I'm saying is there is two sides to every story. Try to remember that next time.\n(Tracker and Sean leave.)\nMedia Immersion.\nMr. S: It was only once, but still, skipping a class even once at this grade level.\nAnnemarie: What is going on here?\nToby: One class. I got carried away in the computer lab.\nAnnemarie: I thought moving in with you and June Clever was supposed to be good for Toby's grades, wasn't that the point?\nJeff: What are you saying?\nToby: Dad, come on.\nAnnemarie: I'm saying that maybe we need to reassess Toby's living arrangements.\nJeff: Don't threaten me.\nAnnemarie: Hey that's your game.\nJeff: What? And breaking commitments is yours? That's why Toby lives with me.\nMr. S: Mr. and Mrs. Issacs. These are common problems for many students.\nAnnemarie: So it's my fault? Jeff, let's not get into the reasons why I left, ok?\nJeff: Reasons why you left? There's only one reason, Annemarie. Your career. Your career that meant so much more to you than we ever did. That's why Toby lives with me and he'll never....\nToby: Mom! Dad! Yeah, my assignment was late! Who's to blame? Video games! I'm telling you, they're destroying my generation.\nAnnemarie: Toby, this isn't a joke.\nToby: I'm not joking, ok? I don't have an excuse, but Dad can't do my homework for me or make sure I go to class. It's my life, right? So, it's my problem. Stop blaming each other and then using me as another excuse to argue. It's not fair. I'll try harder. I promise.\nMr. S: Moving on. All right then. Let's take a look at some of the recent test results. Hall\nAshley: Hey. How did it go in there?\nJeff: Oh, it went okay. Toby just has to apply himself more.\nAnnemarie: Yeah, we're gonna make sure he does his homework on time. But, it went okay.\nPaige: Toby, hon, that's so great.\nAnnemarie: Honey, listen. I've gotta run.\nToby: Gotta get back to work, huh?\nAnnemarie: Yeah. But, hey, listen. Your message came in loud and clear back there. Toby, I'm really sorry. All this stuff between your dad and me, it's tough.\nToby: I know.\nAnnemarie: I love you so much. (They hug) Ashley, you have my permission to keep this monkey in line.\nAshley: Oh, I will. Don't you worry. And it was a pleasure to see you again. An absolute joy. By the way-\nPaige: (gives Annemarie a picture of herself) Something to remember me by.\n(Annemarie sees Terri and gives Terri her card.)\nAnnemarie: If you're interested in acting, give me a call. You have an interesting look.\n(Toby's mom leaves. Paige isn't happy that Terri got the card.)\nClassroom\n(Sean is in there doing work. Emma comes in. He moves his stuff so she can sit down. Emma sends Sean a message apologizing about what happened on Parents Day. The computer tells him he has a new message. He opens it and reads it.)\nSean: I'm sorry too.\nEmma: I'm a little outspoken. It runs in the family.\nSean: Maybe it's contagious. Did you hear my brother?\nEmma: \"Looks like garbage.\"\nSean: \"Smells like garbage.\" It wasn't garbage.\nEmma: Thanks.\nHall\n(Toby is walking when Mr. Simpson comes up to him.)\nMr. S: Toby. Can I speak with you for a minute? Listen, yesterday....\nToby: I just want to apologize again for my parents' behavior.\nMr. S: Oh, Toby, it wasn't your fault. Are they always like that?\nToby: Only when they're together. Honestly Mr. Simpson, yesterday was good. It cleared a lot of air.\nMr. S: I'm glad. Oh, listen, before I forget, next time you want to forge my signature, maybe you should spell my name correctly, and erase the file from the server.\nToby: Mr. Simpson, I can explain.\nMr. S: Good, why don't you start with a 10 page essay on why it's wrong to falsify documents, say by, um, tomorrow morning. And you know what? One final thing. Good work yesterday. Your parents should be proud of you. I certainly was.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

        "prompt_0": "TERMINUS\nBY: STEPHEN GALLAGHER\nPart One\nFirst Air Date: 15 February 1983\nRunning time: 24:58\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: I'm scared. This place is like a maze. Where am I supposed to be going?\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): Your function is to obey, not question.\nTURLOUGH: I may not have must time. I don't think they trust me, especially Tegan.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): The roundel behind you.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): That one. Open it.\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): Operate the blue switches. Now you'll be able to remove the space-time element from beneath the console.\nTURLOUGH: Which switches will release the TARDIS to my control?\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): Do only as I say.\nTEGAN (OOV.): Turlough!\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): Quickly, close the roundel.\nTURLOUGH: Now what do I do?\nGUARDIAN (OOV.): Go to the console room.\nTURLOUGH: And? Where have you gone?\nTEGAN: Who were you talking to?\nTURLOUGH: Oh, no one. I was singing. Not very well, I'm afraid.\nTEGAN: Why didn't you answer when I called?\nTURLOUGH: I'm very sorry, I didn't hear you.\nTEGAN: You're up to something, I can feel it.\nTURLOUGH: I'm simply looking around. The TARDIS is so very large.\nTEGAN: What have you been doing? Have you touched anything?\nTURLOUGH: You look so sweet when you get angry.\nTEGAN: I'm being serious. What have you been doing?\nTURLOUGH: Nothing. You're being foolishly and unjustifiably suspicious. Tegan, why do you dislike me so much?\nTEGAN: You're unreliable.\nTURLOUGH: You hardly know me.\nTEGAN: I heard the way you were talking to the Doctor.\nTURLOUGH: Being friendly hardly makes me unreliable.\nTEGAN: It's the way you were doing it.\nTURLOUGH: Oh, you would prefer I used your sledgehammer tactics?\nTEGAN: At least I'm honest.\nTURLOUGH: Being rude isn't honest. Neither is overreacting. If I choose to smooth the way with a smile and a soft phrase, that doesn't make me unreliable. Charm, the way I use it, is to disagree agreeably.\nTEGAN: You were using it to deceive.\nTURLOUGH: Oh, you're so typical of your planet, reduced to shouting if you can't have your own way.\nTEGAN: I am not!\nTURLOUGH: No? You seem unable to grasp that there are other approaches. To smile before asking.\nTEGAN: Don't patronise me, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: I'm simply relating what I think.\nTEGAN: Turning an argument around is something you're very good at.\nTURLOUGH: Listen to yourself. You're so concrete in the way you think. Why can't you just agree to differ?\nTEGAN: I think you're dangerous.\nTURLOUGH: I think we should try and be friends.\nTEGAN: I'm going to tell the Doctor about the roundel.\nTURLOUGH: Do so, but you'd only make a fool of yourself. I travel in the TARDIS too, now. I have no desire to kill myself. I had no reason to open that roundel. Where are you going?\nTEGAN: To show you to your room.\nTURLOUGH: We're friends?\nTEGAN: Not yet.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: Looks like a kid's room.\nTEGAN: It was Adric's.\nTURLOUGH: Who?\nTEGAN: Doesn't matter.\nTURLOUGH: I've had enough of children, what with that awful school on Earth.\nTEGAN: You can change things if you want.\nTURLOUGH: Right, all this can go for a start.\nTEGAN: It's your room. Do what you like.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: He's got the manners of a pig.\nNYSSA: The Doctor?\nTEGAN: The brat, Turlough.\nNYSSA: He'll settle down.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: It's repaired itself.\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): Concentrate. You have work to do.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: What are you doing?\nNYSSA: Synthesising an enzyme. I seem to need the practice.\nTEGAN: You've done it before.\nNYSSA: Adric did the calculation for me. My own figures aren't as good, as you can see.\nTEGAN: I'll see if I can find his notes, before Turlough destroys them.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: What will this do?\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): You are touching the heart of the TARDIS. Rip it free!\nTURLOUGH: What happens to me?\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): You will be safe. I am ready to lift you away.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: Turlough?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: Turlough?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: It's stuck.\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): Continue.\nTURLOUGH: I'm trying. It won't move.\nGUARDIAN (on scanner): The break-up is beginning. I can sense it. Remove the space-time element!\nTEGAN (OOV.): Turlough?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: Turlough? Oh, no. Doctor!\nDOCTOR: What is it?\nTEGAN: Quickly!\nTEGAN: What is it?\nDOCTOR: We're in trouble. I'll explain later.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: What was Nyssa working on?\nTEGAN: Nothing that could have caused this.\nDOCTOR: The rotor's jamming. Well, there's a safety cut out.\nTURLOUGH: Is Nyssa safe?\nDOCTOR: Well, we'll see. I'm trying to refocus the exterior viewer on the interior of the TARDIS.\nTEGAN: It's just a mess.\nDOCTOR: Dimensional instability, that's the danger. Nyssa!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR (OOV.): Nyssa, can you hear me?\nNYSSA: Yes!\nDOCTOR (OOV.): Stay well back. There's nothing you can do. Nyssa?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: What's that? I saw something just for a moment.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. The outside universe is breaking through.\nTEGAN: Look!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR (OOV.): Look behind you, Nyssa.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Go through, Nyssa. It's your only chance.\nTEGAN: Where are you sending her?\nDOCTOR: I don't know, but if she stays in the room, she'll die.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, if you can hear me,\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR (OOV.): Keep moving. Keep moving, Nyssa. Stay ahead of it. If you don't, it will kill you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: What's that?\nDOCTOR: I don't know.\nTURLOUGH: Where does that door lead to?\nDOCTOR: Another spacecraft.\nTEGAN: Look!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: Where did the other spacecraft come from?\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS found it. There's a fail-safe. On impending break-up, it seeks out and locks onto the nearest spacecraft.\nTEGAN: You never mentioned it before.\nDOCTOR: Well, it never worked before.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: Well?\nDOCTOR: She's gone. Stay there.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: Nyssa's gone.\nTURLOUGH: What was that?\nTEGAN: The Doctor!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: Doctor? Doctor?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGUARDIAN: Follow them.\nTURLOUGH: I can't.\nGUARDIAN: Follow, and kill him!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH (OOV.): Tegan?\nTURLOUGH: I wonder how that happened.\nTEGAN: It seems we have no choice. We go on.\nDOCTOR: What have I sent you into, Nyssa?\nTEGAN: Come on, we can catch up with the Doctor. Come on!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Doctor!\nNYSSA: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: I think it's some sort of old passenger liner.\nNYSSA: And those things?\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, some people have the strangest ideas about decor. Come on, let's get back to the TARDIS.\nKARI: Check the air seal.\nOLVIR: Secure.\nTEGAN: I'm positive that was Nyssa calling.\nTURLOUGH: You heard something. Your imagination did the rest.\nTEGAN: Maybe.\nTURLOUGH: Let's go back.\nTEGAN: No!\nTURLOUGH: Oh, no.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKARI: The whole ship's rigged to run on automatic, yet there's atmosphere. It doesn't fit the briefing at all.\nOLVIR: So what? We're only here for the cargo.\nKARI: Would it really surprise you if there weren't any? This ship is dead.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Ah. I don't remember this. We must have taken a wrong turn.\nNYSSA: What is it?\nDOCTOR: A massive plug. The hull must have been damaged at some time.\nNYSSA: It's still soft.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know. Come on, we'll try, er, this way.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKARI: Advance party to raider. We're coming back. This isn't the ship you described.\nOLVIR: We can't go back if he doesn't link with the airlock.\nDOCTOR (OOV.): Er, this way.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNYSSA: We're lost, aren't we.\nDOCTOR: Certainly not.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Oh, dear. So sorry, I didn't know it was private.\nKARI: That's all right. We're in the mood for company.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nVOICE (OOV.): Help me.\nTURLOUGH: Over there.\nVOICE (OOV.): Help me.\nTEGAN: That's Nyssa!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOLVIR: Kill them. We've enough problems.\nKARI: Be quiet. If you're not members of the crew, how did you get here?\nDOCTOR: We have a ship of our own.\nOLVIR: So they're after the cargo, too.\nKARI: Are you?\nDOCTOR: Unarmed?\nOLVIR: Kari.\nKARI: Watch them.\nOLVIR: That's our ship! He's running out on us!\nKARI: Shut up.\nKARI: Advance party to raider. Come in, raider. Come in. ... Is this your work?\nDOCTOR: Hardly.\nDOCTOR: Neither is that.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: Engines.\nVOICE (OOV.): Please help me.\nTEGAN: Hold on, Nyssa. We must find something to lever the door open.\nTURLOUGH: Let's get out of here.\nTEGAN: Find a pry bar. Now!\nTEGAN (OOV.): Turlough, it's moving!\nTURLOUGH: On my way.\nTEGAN (OOV.): Turlough!\nTURLOUGH: I'm coming!\nTEGAN (OOV.): Turlough!\nTEGAN: Turlough\nTEGAN: Help me!\nTURLOUGH: Are you all right? I found the doorway to the TARDIS.\nTEGAN: Where?\nTURLOUGH: This way. Come on.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNYSSA: Who are they?\nDOCTOR: Raiders, by the look of it. Probably an advance party to open the airlocks.\nKARI: You say you have a ship?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nKARI: I'm commandeering it.\nDOCTOR: I think not.\nDOCTOR: Stop bluffing. You haven't got a chance. Listen to the engines. Alignment manoeuvres. We're docking with another ship.\nKARI: Then I'm asking you, will you take us off this ship?\nDOCTOR: If you put the guns away, please.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nTANNOY: All decks stand by. All decks stand by. This is a special announcement from Terminus Incorporated.\nDOCTOR: I think we should get out of here. Follow me.\nTANNOY: Primary docking alignment procedures are now complete. Passengers with mobility should prepare to disembark.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTANNOY: Anyone failing to disembark will be removed. Sterilisation procedures will then follow.\nTANNOY: There is no return. This is Terminus.\nOLVIR: Wait a minute.\nKARI: Olvir?\nOLVIR: I know where we are.\nKARI: Where?\nTEGAN: They're everywhere.\nTURLOUGH: Give me a hand. Come on, quickly.\nOLVIR: Now we know, don't we? Now we know what its all about.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOLVIR: This is Terminus, where all the lazars come to die.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOLVIR (OOV.): We're on a leper ship! We're all going to die!\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

He need what everbody needs.C'mon.\n[They sit down on either side of Zack.]\nEm: Hey Zack.\nTed: Hay Zack.\nZack: Now what?\nEm: Well, my friend has this live website...\nZack: I'm not interested.\nEm: Oh well, since you have a legend of fans...\nZack: Not interested.\nTed: What better to plug your new picture?\nZack: Whacking off on the web is for amateurs, boys.\nEm: We give you a thousand bucks, and a limousine,champagne and, uh, you're own personal fluffer.\nTed: [whispers] What did you saying?

Following behind him are three students,one of whom is reading the title of Mike's lecture.]\nStudent#1: Homoeroticism Themes and Imagery as Depictedin the Graphic Novel.\nStudent#2: You mean a comic book.\nStudent#1: I can just picture the big essay question onthe final: compare and contrast Michel Foucault withBatman and Robin!\nStudent#2: [laughs] How can you compare homoeroticimagery in comic books with Gide and Genet?\nStudent#3: Proust or Wilde?\nStudent#1: Baldwin or Williams?\nStudent#2: Who's giving this lecture anyway? Spiderman?\nStudent#3: There is this guy who rent a comic book store.\nStudent#1: Well, he should be a real brain trust.\n[Everyone laughs derisively as they walk in the door tothe lecture hall. Mike's pretty much frozen at theentrance.]\n[Mel and Lindsay's House.Lindsay's on the couch, eating cookies and rippingpictures out of bridal magazines. Melanie comes home fromwork. Lindsay gives her a big hug and kiss.]\nLindsay: So, what do you think? Sexy, timeless.\nMel: Gee, you want wearing wedding dresses?\nLindsay: What else?\nMel: Well, we could always wear strap-ons, and getmarried on Ted's website.\nLindsay: I don't think that's funny. How could a nice,intelligent person do something like that? C'mon let's gothose magazines together.\nMel: Alright.\n[Melanie leaves the room for a second and returns with abig cardboard box.]\nLindsay: What do you doing?\nMel: After I came out, in fact I was in college my dadcut my off. He told me that he never want to see meagain. And I figured that I had to find a way to supportmyself. But you know how Jewish parents are. 'Forever'turned out to be three weeks. By then I made up enough topay for the rest of the year's tuition and the next.\n[Mel come out with the Oui magazine. That's a magazine offemale pornography.]\nMel: It's not exactly modern bride.\n[Lindsay takes the issue Mel offers her and thumbsthrough it cautiously. And there Melanie is, buck naked,tummy sucked in, back arched, and lips pursed, fingersintwined in a string of pearls.]\nLindsay: Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god, Mel!\n[The dungeon.]\nTed: 503 people already logged on to see Zack O'Tool.\nEm: Is that good?\nTed: Do the math. 29.95 times 503 is 15.000 dollars.Yeah, this is very, very good.\nEm: And all want to see Zack wack.

Brian comes up behind him andstarts to nuzzle his neck.]\nJustin: Stop!\nBrian: Why? What have you something better to do?\nJustin: Homework?\nBrian: Well, I'm in a really sh1t trouble. You're notstill upset about the Zucchini Man, are you? I don't evenremember it or him. It was nothing.\nJustin: I know. It's just you being you. I know who youare. I don't expect you to change, in fact, I don't evenwant you to.\nBrian: Then what?\nJustin: Why am I here?\nBrian: One night you're mommy and daddy want to make ababy...\nJustin: You know what I'm mean. It's just you feel guiltyabout what happened? [Pause] Answer me. Answer me! If Ihadn't get bash in the hat would I even be here?\n[Brian doesn't have a quick enough answer to that, andJustin picks up his stuff and stalks off.]\n[Mike's closing the store. Bencomes up.]\nBen: Hey Michael. I was trying to catch you.\nMichael: Well, you caught me.\nBen: Yeah, the class waitin' for you. You never showed.\nMichael: Yeah, the thing is I was really busy. I had youjust called. I'm sorry.\nBen: But I'd like to reschedule. How's Thursday?\nMichael: Well, I'm starting a new business. I don't thinkI have the time.\nBen: Yeah, uh, I think I understand. It was an impositionin the first place.\nMichael: Wait, wait. Look. The truth is I'm not Brainiac.\nBen: Well wait, one of Superman's arch-villains, am Iright? See, I'm learning.\nMichael: I'm impressed. Standing in front of a bunch ofcollege students pretending that I know something isbullshit!\nBen: Why is it bullshit, Michael?\nMichael: Because the Justice League of America isn'texactly Proust or Foucault, or whoever the f*ck they are.\nBen: You could tell them something. What you know is justas valuable. You have this incredible knowledge of gaysemiotics that you don't even realize.\nMichael: Gay what?\nBen: Never mind, it is no matter. The point is you havethis...\nMichael: Passion?\nBen: Irradiate it. It's like the Flynn.\nMichael: Well, that must be why...I'm a little hot.\n[The dungeon.]\nTed: No, no, they're bailing fast.\nEm: Well, what did you expect? Signing up to see ZackO'Tool and instead they get me. They screaming for therunning back.\nTed: And I'm gonna give it to them unless you start doin'something!\n[Emmett lamely waves at the camera.]\nTed: Take something off!\n[Emmett gingerly unbuttons his shirt.]\nTed: Better. Take off you're goddamn pants!\nEm: Alright!\n[Emmett turns his back to the camera, cautiously takesoff his pants and strips down to his black bikiniunderwear.]\nTed: And now you're undies. Good, right. 180 and holding.I think we've stopped the bleeding.\nEm: What do I do now?\nTed: What do you mean? You grab your pud and you pull!\n[Emmett slowly turns around to face the camera.]\nTed: It's starting to grow up.\nEm: So am I.\nTed: Holy sh1t!\nEm: What? What?\nTed: You're bigger than O'Tool! Our subscriber are to,250. OK, keep stroking!\nEm: I always told you I was a grower, not a show-er. Whatwaiting for me to shoot?\nTed: Not yet.\nEm: How much longer?\nTed: 530! Now, now, now! Go, go, go. Shoot, shoot, shoot!\n[He shoots all over himself.]\nTed: Emmett, that's amazing. That is amazing! No one'sever going to know that you used the jizzball.\nTed: What jizzball?\n[Ben's classroom. Mike finallygets to give his lecture.]\nMichael: The male figure has been worshipped fromMichelangelo's David all the way to Captain Astro.\n[There's even a slide show behind him, showing variouscomic book heroes.]\nMichael: The strength and musculare... [he stopps] ofthe... of the...\n[Ben nods at him reassuringly. Mike gives his head ashake and sighs.]\nMichael: I'm sorry, you know what? I haven't a clue whathomoeroticism in literature means, I just know that TheFlash looks good in tights. I start reading Flash andSuperman and Captain America when I was just a kid. Atfirst, because it was fun. I liked the stories, and Iliked the pictures. It was a great escape from all theshit -- uh, sorry, the stuff that was bugging me. And mymom didn't want me to read them. But later at I'mrealised that... later as I'm realised that I was gay Iread them for a different reason. Because, in ways thatmaybe were not intended, these superheroes were a lotlike me. You know, at work they were meek andunderappreciated. They were the guys that never getlaid... [students laughs] And when they're around otherpeople, they can't let anybody get too close for fearthat their true identities would be discovered. Withinall the villians and the monsters and the evil forcesthat are trying to destroy them somehow they're survived.Even the one thing that can kill Superman, one thingwhich he has no immunity, cryptonit, altermately you knowthat he'll survive that and he'll go on and safe theworld. I believe the same about us. That's what thecomics have shown me -- that despite everything, we'llsurvive. And we'll win. But back to the guy in thetights. [class laughs and so Ben.]\n[It's raining in Pittsburgh, andJustin shows up on Debbie's doorstep, drenched to thebone.]\nDebbie: Sunshine! What are you doin' here?\nJustin: You haven't rent my old room, yet?\nDebbie: No, come in here.\n[Cut to Brian at Woody's.]\nDebbie: Hasn't the kid went through enough that you causehim more pain?\nBrian: Stay out of it!\nDebbie: The f*ck I will! I care about him, all you careabout is you're...\nBrian: ...getting my dick sucked. I think that form isestablished. Now Debbie move on from there.\nDebbie: Look, all I want is...\nBrian: ...to interfere?\nDebbie: You can call whatever the f*ck you want. I don'twant Justin hurt.\nBrian: Well, that's life, isn't it? Surprise!\nDebbie: You think you have everybody fooled, don't ya?But not me, honey. I've known you too long. Andregrettably, too well. And no matter how hard you triedto deny it I can tell you care as much about him as hecares about you. Only you haven't the big hairy ball tosay it.\nBrian: Oh, maybe I can borrow your's?\nDebbie: Whatever it takes. To admit that you love him.And I know you do. Despite all your efforts to never letanother heart touch yours, that assume you have one. Thatlittle persistent kid has somehow gotten under the wire.And that's what happen, huh? Admit the truth. You lovehim, don't ya? [Pause] I though so. Then tell him. Tellhim what you could never say to Michael.\n[Babylon!]\nTed: Hey, how about a drink after this hard day work?\n[Ted hands out flyers for the website to all the Hotties,one of whom is checking Emmett out.]\nEm: What that incredible cute guy crusing me?\nTed: Not just cruising. He's in maximum overdrive.\nMan#1: Excuse me, what that you today on the website?\nTed: Oh yeah, it was. And come back and see him onJerkAtWork.net soon.\nMan#1: You're performance was really inspiring. You mindsigning this for me?\nEm: Oh, ok. To Christopher. Thanks for being such...a bigfan..I hope I can live up to it. All my best...love andluck...Emmett. Honeycutt.\nMan#1: Wow, thanks.\n[The man leaves them.]\nTed: My little star. We've get you a p0rn name.\nEm: What's wrong with Emmett Honeycutt?\nTed: No, p0rn lore has it that you're supposed to takethe name of your childhood pet, and add the street thatyou grew up on.\nEm: My favourite mutch war Fetch.\nTed: And the street?\nEm: We live at the corner of Nathan and Dixon.\nTed: Fetch Dixon. A star is...p0rn.\n[The Happy Fun Bedroom. Lindsayflips through another bridal magazine. She decides tocheck out that issue of Oui instead, and flips straightto Melanie's pictures. Melanie eventually catches Lindsaymasturbating to them.]\nMel: I though you didn't like p0rn.\nLindsay: And I like even less thinking about all thosestrange men, and even a few women, looking at you.\nMel: It was a long time ago before I knew you.\nLindsay: Why you didn't have ever told me?\nMel: It's not something really boost about. I practicallyforget about it.\nLindsay: I doesn't like having any secrets. There aren'tmore, are there?\n[Mel shakes her head and pulls off her tank top.]\nMel: I swear. What about you?\nLindsay: Well, there was that time I was a hooker inAlaska. But that was only a summer job.\nMel: I used to have a pretty hot bod.\nLindsay: You still do.\nMel: Why settle for a magazine when you can have the realthing?\n[Babylon! In grainy black andwhite, no less. From the balcony, Brian watches Justinmake out with an Hottie on the dance floor.]\nBrian: Hey.\nJustin: Hey.\nBrian: [to the hottie] Hey, f*ck off!\nJustin: What do you want?\nBrian: You were right. The reason I took you in was thatyou took a bat to the head. But that's not the reasonthat I want you to stay. But don't get the idea we'resome married couple. Cause we're not. We're not, like,f*cking straight people. We're not like you're parents.And we're not a parent dykes marching on the fareways.We're queers, and if we're together, it's because we wantto be, not because there's matching locks on our doors.So if I'm out just assume I'm doin' exactly what I wantto doin'. I'm f*cking. And when I come home, I'm alsodoing what I want to be doing. Coming home to you.\nJustin: OK, I want some things too. You can f*ck whoeveryou want, as long as it is not twice. Same for me. And nonames or numbers exchanged. And no matter where you are,no matter what you're doin' you always come home. Say 2.\nBrian: 4.\nJustin: 3 AM. One more thing. You don't kiss anyone elseon the mouth but me.\n[In response, Brian gives him a big old heartstopper of akiss.]\n[At Ben's home. Ben brings Mike abeer, and a book.]\nMichael: Thanks.\nBen: Oh, I've got something else for ya.\nMichael: R-U-1-2? R-U-1-2, I get it! You're wrote this?You wrote a book?\nBen: Yes, yes, it's me first and last novel. Which thereviewer called \"a noble effort from a fresh newvoice.\" There was on the remainder table soonafterward.\nMichael: I didn't nobody who wrote a book before.\nBen: Open it.\nMichael: \"To Michael. Beneath his mild-manneredappearance beats the heart of a superhero. Ben.\" Idon't know what to say.\n[He gives Ben a hug.]\nBen: So, where were we?\nMichael: About this.\n[They start making out. Kissing. Unbuttoning each other'sshirts. Pants. But Ben suddenly pulls away! Mike'sconfused.]\nBen: Hey, hey, Michael. Wait a minute.\nMichael: What for?\nBen: I just want you to know that... I'm HIV-positive.\nEnd.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The text is a dialogue between two men, Brian and Justin, and two men, Ben and Michael. The dialogue is about their relationship and their sexual preferences. Brian and Justin are a couple who are not straight, and they are not like the parents of Ben and Michael. They are queers who are together because they want to be, not because they have matching locks on their doors. Brian and Justin have a mutual agreement that they can do what they want, as long as it is not twice. They also have a mutual agreement that they will not exchange names or numbers, and that they will always come home to each other. Ben and Michael are also a couple, and they have a mutual agreement that they will not kiss anyone else on the mouth but each other. Ben has written a book, and he has given it to Michael as a gift.

A figure appears from the shadows behind him; IAN turns.)\nIAN: Leon?\nLEON: Yes. You must be Ian.\nIAN: That's right.\nLEON: Are you alone?\nIAN: Yes. Jules said you might be able to help.\n(IAN hear sounds behind him, and turns to find two SOLDIERS behind him. They are both aiming muskets at his chest.)\nIAN: Soldiers!\n(He turns back to face LEON. The Frenchman has drawn a pair of ornate pistols, and also points them at IAN.)\nLEON: Yes, I know. You walked right into my trap, didn't you, Ian?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n2. PARIS SQUARE\n(The episode credits are shown over a representation of a square in Paris. Sounds of cheering crowds are heard as the guillotine falls and claims yet another victim.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n3. CHURCH CRYPT\nLEON: You can put all ideas of escape out of your head. And as for your rescue - well no-one will come here, you can take my word for that.\nIAN: If I don't go back, Jules is going to get suspicious.\nLEON: By the time that happens, my friend, we shall have left. And afterwards we'll take care of him.\n(LEON clicks his fingers, and the SOLDIERS grab him and drag him against a pillar with iron rings set into it. They secure his wrists with heavy chains, which they attach to the rings. IAN struggles as they do so.)\nIAN: You never know who your friends are!\nLEON: My association with Jules was bound to come to an end. He already suspected that... a traitor, if you want to use those words, was working in the organisation. But it's no matter. We're ready now to close in on him too.\nIAN: So what do you want with me?\nLEON: Information.\n(IAN scoffs.)\nLEON: You will cooperate, Ian. Think about it. We have plenty of time.\n(He stares at IAN for a moment, then turns and exits, leaving the two SOLDIERS to guard the prisoner. One talks to IAN.)\nSOLDIER: He's giving you time to consider.\nIAN: I don't need time, I have no information.\nSOLDIER: We'll decide that when you talk. And you'll talk, you'll talk!\n(He flashes IAN an evil smile.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n4. LEMAITRE'S OFFICE\n(BARBARA and the DOCTOR have just been reunited.)\nBARBARA: Oh, Doctor, I thought we were never going to see you again!\nDOCTOR: You should know by now, young lady, that you can't get rid of the old Doctor as easily as that.\n(They both chuckle.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n5. CORRIDOR\n(Just outside the office, LEMAITRE is listening through the door to every word of the conversation.)\nBARBARA: (OOV.) Tell me, how did you get out of that burning farmhouse?\nDOCTOR: (OOV.) Oh, never mind about that now.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n6. LEMAITRE'S OFFICE\nDOCTOR: What happened? Where's Susan? How is she?\nBARBARA: She's here. We were arrested together.\nDOCTOR: She's here?\nBARBARA: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Is she well?\nBARBARA: Yes, she's fine. She had a slight fever, but she's recovered now.\nDOCTOR: Good. Well now, we must find Chesterton and try and get back to the ship.\nBARBARA: Oh, I know where he is!\nDOCTOR: Mm?\nBARBARA: I know where he is.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes?\nBARBARA: We were all in hiding at a house owned by a Jules Renan...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n7. CORRIDOR\n(LEMAITRE still listens intently. He notices the JAILER waddling down the corridor towards him, and turns to face him. He speaks to the JAILER in a hushed voice.)\nLEMAITRE: Not now, Jailer!\nJAILER: But Citizen...\nLEMAITRE: Later!\nJAILER: But...\nLEMAITRE: I said, not now!\nJAILER: I've just had a message from the First Deputy, Citizen!\n(LEMAITRE moves away from the door.)\nLEMAITRE: Well, what is it?\nJAILER: Robespierre says 'e wants to see you immediately. It's a matter of the utmost importance. Robespierre said immediately, Citizen.\nLEMAITRE: Yes, yes.\n(He turns to leave, exasperated.)\nLEMAITRE: Has the young girl been locked away?\nJAILER: She has. I saw to it myself, just as you ordered, Citizen.\nLEMAITRE: Good. She shall remain in her cell, do you understand? Under no circumstances is the door to be opened.\nJAILER: Just as you say, Citizen.\nLEMAITRE: And if that order is disobeyed... I'll have you guillotined.\n(He exits, leaving a very worried looking JAILER behind him.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n8. LEMAITRE'S OFFICE\n(The DOCTOR has just had a brain wave.)\nDOCTOR: Yes, that's it! That's it!\n(BARBARA is not listening.)\nBARBARA: Oh, I should never have taken Susan to see that physician.\nDOCTOR: Oh, don't blame yourself, Barbara. As it happens, everything has turned out very well. Might have taken us ages to find each other.\nBARBARA: Do you think we stand a chance of getting out of here?\nDOCTOR: Well, my voice seems to carry some weight, hm?\nBARBARA: Yes, well I'm not surprised in that get-up.\n(The DOCTOR preens himself.)\nDOCTOR: Yes, it's rather impressive, isn't it? Now, listen. I'm going through that door. Give me a few minutes, then I want you to go through the door and straight out of the prison.\nBARBARA: Are you serious?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely serious, but I've no time to explain. Just do as you're asked.\nBARBARA: What about Susan?\nDOCTOR: Well, I'll look after her and follow you later.\nBARBARA: But Doctor, you...\nDOCTOR: Now now now, there's no buts, don't argue. You know my plans always work perfectly. Hm?\n(BARBARA decides against making the obvious comment.)\nDOCTOR: In a few minutes, then.\n(He leaves, closing the door firmly behind him.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n9. JAILER'S ALCOVE\n(The DOCTOR enters to see the JAILER sitting at his desk.)\nDOCTOR: Ah, tell me. Is Lemaitre here?\nJAILER: He's, uh, left to see Citizen Robespierre.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear dear dear, how irritating, and I did want him so urgently.\nJAILER: Well, I'm sure he'll be back shortly, Citizen.\nDOCTOR: No no no, this matter can't wait, it's urgent! I've just been interrogating that young woman, and I'm convinced she's a member of that dangerous Traitor's Party.\nJAILER: Oh, I see, I see.\nDOCTOR: And do you know, she could tell us the names of every traitor in this country!\n(The JAILER believes every word.)\nJAILER: Perhaps we should make her talk?\nDOCTOR: No, no chance of that. No, she'd rather die first than betray her friends. No, I think, if there's only some way of using her... if only we could get, through her, to her friends...\n(He waits expectantly for the JAILER to have a brain wave.)\nJAILER: Perhaps...\nDOCTOR: Mm?\nJAILER: Perhaps...\nDOCTOR: Perhaps what?\nJAILER: Well, if she were to escape, she could be followed. She'd meet these traitors, then we'd arrest them. Lemaitre once did this.\nDOCTOR: My dear, what an excellent idea! What an excellent idea! Yes, of course, now why didn't I think of that? Yes, that's what we'll do, and Lemaitre will be delighted! Now look here, Mr Jailer, I want you to open those prison doors, keep out of sight.\nJAILER: Oh, but er...\nDOCTOR: Tch, tch, tch, no buts, no! And sooner or later, that young woman will come through those doors and we can grab her! Go along, quickly!\n(He sends the JAILER off to the prison doors, then disappears down to the cells, a satisfied grin on his face.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n10. RENAN'S SITTING ROOM\n(JULES enters and looks around frantically.)\nJULES: Ian, Barbara, Susan? Ian? Ian?\n(He calls upstairs and looks around.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n11. CHURCH CRYPT\n(IAN rattles his wrist chains. The SOLDIER standing by him laughs.)\nSOLDIER: Getting impatient, are we? That's a good sign. Citizen Colbert really knows how to make pigs like you talk. He leaves 'em alone, makes them think. Now me, I have other ways.\n(He raises the butt of his musket, ready to hit IAN in the face, but is interrupted by a call from the entrance to the crypt.)\nLEON: Stop that!... I'm sorry - I'm afraid my men are very bad-tempered. Ian, I don't want anything to happen to you really, but I think you have the information that will help the cause I believe in.\nIAN: You're wasting your time with me. I'm very small fry.\nLEON: Surely you don't expect me to believe that? Well, we learned of the existence of James Stirling two months ago. We've been searching for him ever since.\nIAN: We?\nLEON: Yes. I've been loyal to the Revolution from the beginning. If you'd known what France was like six years ago, before the Bastille, you'd understand.\nIAN: I do understand, but I can't help you.\nLEON: Or you won't! France will never be anything until we're rid of these high-born leeches who've been sucking the life-blood of France for so long.\nIAN: You must believe me, I can help you in no way...\nLEON: Ian! You can save yourself a lot of trouble and suffering by talking. This is your only chance! Do you realise that when I've finished with you I'll transfer you to the prison, and then the guillotine? Now if you were to talk, I have the power to set you free!\nIAN: Jules must have told you all I know.\nLEON: Ah yes, what did Jules say? That Webster gave you a message to give to Stirling.\nIAN: Yes, that's right. Only I can't recognise Stirling - that's why I'm here.\nLEON: Oh, that I accept. But you must have known of their organisation. You were in it with Webster! He would never have trusted you otherwise. Now. Who sent you from England? How did you get here, and who helped you?\nIAN: (Sighs.) What's the use?\nLEON: I really don't understand what you hope to gain! If I don't get the information from you, I shall find it elsewhere! Now be sensible. Save yourself from the guillotine.\nIAN: You wouldn't believe my story anyway.\nLEON: Suppose you let me be the judge of that. How did you get to France?\nIAN: You really want to know, eh?\nLEON: The truth?\nIAN: Oh yes, it's the truth all right.\nLEON: You swear it?\nIAN: Yes, I swear it! I flew here with three friends in a small box. When I left England it was 1963.\n(LEON steps back, furious, and signals to the nearer SOLDIER, who strides forward, musket and bayonet pointed towards IAN. IAN braces himself for the blow, then hears a yell from the entrance.)\nJULES: All right, Leon! Release him!\n(JULES is standing in the entrance, a pistol pointed at LEON's back. The second SOLDIER swings his musket around, but JULES is faster and shoots him dead. LEON reaches for his pistols, but JULES hurls his now spent weapon at LEON's face. LEON falls back with a cry, dropping his guns. The SOLDIER by IAN has cocked his musket and swings it round to aim at the now unarmed JULES. IAN gathers his strength, hauls himself up by his wrist chains, and kicks the SOLDIER on the side of the head - he falls. LEON recovers and grabs his pistols; IAN shouts a warning.)\nIAN: Jules!\n(JULES grabs the falling SOLDIER whom IAN has just kicked, and hold him up as a shield, just as LEON fired. The two bullets ring out simultaneously, and both hit the SOLDIER. As JULES drops the lifeless body, LEON steps back towards the discarded musket. JULES watches as he steps nearer, then casually reaches into his coat and draws a second pistol.)\nJULES: You traitor! It's you who's the enemy of the people!\n(LEON makes a desperate lunge for the musket, but JULES fires first. LEON collapses, dead. JULES turns to free IAN.)\nIAN: I thought I was going mad when I saw you here! Why did you come?\nJULES: Bad news for you.\nIAN: Oh?\nJULES: Barbara and Susan were arrested at the physician.\n(JULES fiddles with the iron rings, and IAN pulls his wrists clear.)\nIAN: Yes, I feared that as soon as Leon turned up here. We must get to them.\nJULES: I think it's best to go back to my hide-out.\nIAN: What? The soldiers will be there already!\nJULES: Well, if I know Leon, he will have wanted the satisfaction of arresting me himself. And anyway, we'll just have to risk it. Come on.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n12. CELLS\n(SUSAN is sitting on a wooden bed board. She hears a tapping at the cell door, and looks through the bars. She can make out a figure dressed in official uniform.)\nSUSAN: What is it? What d'you want?\nDOCTOR: Susan, Susan, it... it's me, child! Me!\n(SUSAN rushes to the door.)\nSUSAN: Oh, grandfather! Oh grandfather, you've found us! Well how'd you get away from the farmhouse?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I can't explain that now, child, it'd take too long.\nSUSAN: Oh, Barbara's here somewhere.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well I've taken care of that. She should be out of the prison and well on her way now. And I...\n(He stops and listens. Faint footsteps are approaching.)\nDOCTOR: Sh! There's someone coming! Quiet! See you later. Sh!\nSUSAN: Be careful!\nDOCTOR: Sh!\n(He leaves in a hurry.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n13.JAILER'S ALCOVE\n(The DOCTOR bumps into the JAILER, who reacts with a shock.)\nJAILER: But Citizen!\nDOCTOR: Mm?\nJAILER: Didn't you collect the soldiers and follow the released prisoner?\nDOCTOR: Me? Certainly not!\nJAILER: But... whatever... why not?\nDOCTOR: But I was under the impression, my dear man, that you were doing so! I'm hardly dressed in the proper clothes to go skulking after people, now am I?\nJAILER: I couldn't have gone! I can't leave the prison!\nDOCTOR: Well why didn't you say that in the first place? Well, did you?\nJAILER: No, Citizen.\nDOCTOR: No, and what do you think Lemaitre will say? He's bound to want to know whose idea it was.\n(The JAILER hangs his head in misery.)\nJAILER: It was mine. Citizen, you must help me!\nDOCTOR: I'll try. Now don't worry, I'll cover up for you. But you know, I have a feeling that this young girl is tied up in this somehow. Now I think if we let her go, I personally could follow, and then arrest all of them! All I need from you is the key to that child's cell.\nJAILER: Citizen, Lemaitre was very clear with his instructions. If that door is opened, I lose my head. That's what, what Lemaitre said just before he left, that's what he said!\nDOCTOR: Lemaitre, Lemaitre! Why can't you use your own initiative, my man, hm?\nJAILER: Aye, well you must see him when he returns, Citizen. I'm just a humble servant. If his orders are countermanded, well then...\nDOCTOR: I demand you open that door!\n(The JAILER is almost panicking, but stands firm.)\nJAILER: To lose one prisoner is bad enough, to lose two would be the end of me! Especially after my orders. Lemaitre will be returning soon. We'll do as he says - until then, that door remains closed.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n14. ROBESPIERRE'S OFFICE\n(ROBESPIERRE paces nervously up and down. He sees LEMAITRE arrive in the ante chamber.)\nROBESPIERRE: Ah good, Lemaitre.\n(LEMAITRE enters, and ROBESPIERRE addresses the GUARD on the door.)\nROBESPIERRE: We are not to be disturbed.\n(The GUARD exits and shuts the door.)\nROBESPIERRE: The news is serious, Citizen, and there is not much time.\nLEMAITRE: I am at your service. You have only to give the order.\nROBESPIERRE: There is a meeting of the Convention tomorrow.\nLEMAITRE: Yes, I know, Citizen.\nROBESPIERRE: I have been warned that certain influential Members - traitors, all of them - are planning to bring an indictment against another Member.\nLEMAITRE: You have their names?\n(ROBESPIERRE ignores the question.)\nROBESPIERRE: Oh, I realise they are forever plotting. But this latest information suggests that more and more of the Paris Commune are taking sides. The plan is that even I shall not be allowed to speak! They're out to destroy me!\nLEMAITRE: All is not lost, Citizen. You still have many friends sitting in the Convention.\nROBESPIERRE: But can I trust them? If this motion gets underway, they will turn against me to save their own necks. Mark my words, Lemaitre. If this plot is successful, tomorrow, the 27th of July 1794, will be a date for history!\nLEMAITRE: Tell me the leader of this group, Citizen - he will be immediately executed!\nROBESPIERRE: Patience, Lemaitre. This is no lone voice we are fighting against. If they are to hold power, they will need the Army on their side. Meetings must have been arranged.\nLEMAITRE: By whom?\nROBESPIERRE: It is my guess that Deputy Paul Barrass is at the forefront of the rebels, but I must be certain before I strike. I shall not get a second chance, Lemaitre.\nLEMAITRE: Tell me what I must do.\nROBESPIERRE: I understand that Barrass is leaving Paris tonight. I assume it must be for a meeting. With the position as it is, it can be for no other reason. I want to know who with, and the decision. Given that, I can still defeat my enemies.\nLEMAITRE: What if he's just a decoy?\nROBESPIERRE: That is my worry, Lemaitre. Tonight my men will be everywhere. Barrass is your responsibility.\nLEMAITRE: I shall not fail you... Against which Member is the indictment being brought, Citizen?\nROBESPIERRE: Against me, Lemaitre! Against me, Robespierre!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n15. RENAN'S SITTING ROOM\n(Footsteps can be heard approaching the outside door. The door opens slowly, then closes again, and IAN and JULES enter cautiously.)\nJULES: Leon was right... Leon was right. He did not tell me about this place. We're safe here for the moment. But I shall have to give up this house very soon. It's becoming too dangerous.\n(IAN moves into the room, and sees BARBARA lying on the sofa, hidden from view of the entrance.)\nIAN: Barbara! We thought you'd been arrested!\nBARBARA: Yes, we were. But when we got to the prison, the Doctor was there.\nIAN: What!\nBARBARA: Yes, he's dressed up as if he was running the revolution! From what I could gather, half the people there take orders from him!\nIAN: That sounds like the Doctor, alright.\nJULES: The Doctor? You mean Susan's grandfather?\nBARBARA: Yes, that's right.\nIAN: And where's Susan?\nBARBARA: Oh, she'll be along later with him. I just walked out.\nIAN: Walked out? But... (Laughs.) I don't know how he gets away with it half the time. What did he say?\nBARBARA: Well not very much - we didn't have a chance. But he'll be here soon, so no doubt we'll get the whole story, several times.\n(They laugh wryly, then BARBARA notices IAN's bandaged wrists.)\nBARBARA: What have you done?\nIAN: Oh, it's nothing much... Let's just say I... fell into the wrong hands, and Jules arrived in time.\nBARBARA: And Leon?\nJULES: He's dead, Barbara. I killed him.\nBARBARA: Killed him?\nJULES: Yes. He was the traitor we were looking for.\n(BARBARA is shocked and aghast.)\nIAN: It was the only way, Barbara.\nJULES: (Coldly.) He deserved to die. He was a traitor.\nBARBARA: What do you mean, \"he was a traitor\"?\nIAN: When I got to the church, he turned on me. He was going to kill me.\nJULES: He betrayed us, Barbara.\nBARBARA: He was a traitor to you - to his side he was a patriot.\nIAN: Barbara, we've taken sides just by being here. Jules actually shot him. It could just as easily have been me.\nJULES: And what about Robespierre? I suppose you think...\nBARBARA: Well just because an extremist like Robespierre...\n(IAN cuts in angrily.)\nIAN: Oh Barbara, Jules is our friend! He saved our lives!\nBARBARA: I know all that! The revolution isn't all bad, and neither are the people who support it. It changed things for the whole world, and good, honest people gave their lives for that change.\nIAN: Well I think he got what he deserved.\nBARBARA: You check your history books, Ian, before you decide what people deserve!\n(She storms out of the room, leaving IAN staring angrily after her. JULES looks very perplexed at the end of the argument.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n16. CELLS\n(The DOCTOR appears outside the locked door of SUSAN's cell, holding the JAILER's bottle of cognac.)\nSUSAN: Oh, grandfather! I thought you were never coming!\nDOCTOR: I shall have you out of here soon, but I must have your help! Now look, I want you to get down onto the floor, behind this door, and don't move, whatever you do!\nSUSAN: But grandfather...\nDOCTOR: Do it now, child, don't argue! Do it now! And don't make a sound! Stay there!\n(SUSAN ducks down. The DOCTOR hears footsteps approaching.)\nDOCTOR: There's someone coming.\nSUSAN: Be careful!\nDOCTOR: Just... just don't fuss.\n(The DOCTOR moves into the shadows as the steps get nearer. Soon the JAILER appears, muttering to himself. The DOCTOR steps out, and the JAILER looks up.)\nJAILER: Oh, it'll be the end of me, this business. I don't know what Lemaitre will say.\nDOCTOR: Oh, he's not back yet then, eh?\nJAILER: Oh, we can expect him any minute!\nDOCTOR: Hmm...\n(He looks at SUSAN's cell.)\nDOCTOR: Jailer! Jailer! That girl, she's gone!\nJAILER: What?\nDOCTOR: She's gone!\n(The JAILER rushes to the cell door, looks through the bars, sees the cell apparently empty, and exclaims in panic.)\nJAILER: She's gone!\n(He fumbles for the keys and eventually manages to put the correct one in the lock and open the door. The DOCTOR produces the bottle from behind his back and whacks the JAILER over the head, knocking him out. SUSAN stands up from just inside the door.)\nDOCTOR: Come along, child, quickly! Quick...\n(He hurries her out of the cell, only to walk straight into LEMAITRE, who reacts instantly.)\nLEMAITRE: Guards! Guards!\n(Two prison GUARDS come running, and grab hold of the DOCTOR and SUSAN. The JAILER groggily staggers to his feet and looks at LEMAITRE.)\nJAILER: He tricked me, Citizen. He tricked me!\nLEMAITRE: Lock her away.\n(The GUARDS throw SUSAN back into the cell, and the JAILER locks the door.)\nJAILER: He did as you said 'e would, Citizen. He tried to get the young girl released, and he let the other prisoner go!\nDOCTOR: Oh, spare your breath, please! I'm quite capable of explaining the situation myself.\nLEMAITRE: Alright, Jailer.\n(He turns to the DOCTOR.)\nLEMAITRE: I think it's about time we had a talk.\n(He gestures the DOCTOR ahead of him, and they walk towards his office.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n17. LEMAITRE'S OFFICE\n(The DOCTOR feigns indignance as LEMAITRE shuts the door.)\nDOCTOR: I must insist that you reason- release that young child immediately!\nLEMAITRE: I'm afraid you're not in a position to insist on anything at the moment!\n(He walks slowly across the room and sits at the desk. He casually pulls open one of the desk drawers.)\nDOCTOR: Position, sir? Do you realise who you're talking to?\nLEMAITRE: Not yet. But I intend to find out. Do you recognise this, Citizen?\n(He produces the DOCTOR's ring. The DOCTOR takes and examines it briefly.)\nDOCTOR: No. Should I?\n(LEMAITRE reaches under the desk for the DOCTOR's clothes.)\nLEMAITRE: And these. They're yours, aren't they? Given in exchange for those rather splendid clothes and the insignia of a Regional Provincial Deputy.\nDOCTOR: Do you know that's the biggest fairy story I've ever heard in my life?\nLEMAITRE: I could have had you arrested any time I wanted!\n(The DOCTOR realises the game is up.)\nDOCTOR: Yes - why didn't you?\n(He makes to put the ring down on the table.)\nDOCTOR: Please please, keep it.\nLEMAITRE: Why didn't I? Well, with the political situation as it is, and my position being what it is, I need friends. Even if they're enemies. People I can call on for help - if I have something on them, so much the better.\nDOCTOR: It's become quite obvious to me why you didn't wish me to leave the prison.\nLEMAITRE: Huh! I knew I'd never see you again if you did.\nDOCTOR: But you relaxed the regulations today, and I could have walked out any time I wished.\nLEMAITRE: And left your granddaughter?\n(He notices the DOCTOR's guilty reaction.)\nLEMAITRE: Just an assumption, but obviously correct. I knew I had you so long as she remained here under lock and key. If you remember, when I first met you, you were enquiring after your friends. The young woman, whom the jailer says you've just released, the girl and, err, what was his name - Ian.\nDOCTOR: So you knew all the time?\nLEMAITRE: Let's just say I added to my knowledge. Listening at doors can still be effective.\nDOCTOR: What do you want?\nLEMAITRE: Ah. So I see we understand each other. If you agree to help me, your granddaughter will be released - after you have kept your side of the bargain.\nDOCTOR: The least I can do is listen.\nLEMAITRE: Good! Now, I'm reasonably certain that your group are working with, or for, Jules Renan. I think you used his hideout - certainly you know where it is, and if you don't, your granddaughter does.\nDOCTOR: I have never met the man! Oh, I fully appreciate why you must want to find him, but if you think that I am going to betray him, then you are a very poor judge of character.\nLEMAITRE: If you want your granddaughter released, you will have to take me to his hideout.\nDOCTOR: Never, sir, I refuse!\nLEMAITRE: I repeat - if you want your granddaughter released, you do not have a choice!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n18. RENAN'S SITTING ROOM\n(BARBARA enters to find IAN alone in the room. She has calmed down after her earlier outburst.)\nBARBARA: Where's Jules?\nIAN: He went to the end of the street, to look for Susan and the Doctor.\nBARBARA: Well, the Doctor would have to wait for the right moment.\nIAN: Yes, but how long can we wait?\nBARBARA: Oh, I don't know. Whenever somebody passes the house, I think it might be them.\nIAN: Yes, I know. Barbara - sorry about Leon, but it really was the only way, believe me.\nBARBARA: I know... I wanted to apologise to Jules... I'm so sick and tired of death, Ian. We never seem able to get away from it.\n(JULES has entered unnoticed.)\nJULES: There is no way, Barbara.\n(He shuts the door as they turn towards him.)\nJULES: Well, there's no sign of your friends.\nBARBARA: Well, we must wait a little longer.\nJULES: Mm. I left the door unlatched.\nIAN: Oh, so now anyone can walk in!\nJULES: Try and be patient, Ian... Oh, I know these long hours of waiting only too well. I've had my share.\nBARBARA: Jules... when I spoke to you before, I... the things I said...\nJULES: You said because of Leon the man. Yes, I know. But I did what I had to do because of what he represents. Do you ever wonder why I'm doing these things, hiding in shadows, fighting in corners?\nIAN: We took it for granted you belonged to the other side, the aristocracy.\nJULES: No. No, I have no title or position. I belong, well, in the middle. But I hate to see order thrown out of the window like so much dust. There can be no loyalty or honour where anarchy prevails.\nBARBARA: And Leon was your friend.\nJULES: There are only two sides today, Barbara. Those who rule by fear and treachery, and those who fight for reason and justice. Anyone who betrays these principles is worse than the devil in hell!\n(They hear a noise at the outside door.)\nIAN: Here they are.\n(He looks as the door from the hall opens. In walks the DOCTOR, still in his official uniform; behind him is the tall figure of LEMAITRE!)\nBARBARA: Lemaitre!\nJULES: Your friend has betrayed us!\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Come on.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLYTTON: That was a shambles.\nTROOPER: The escape was prevented?\nLYTTON: They got out of the warehouse. It should never have happened. And who ordered the use of machine pistols?\nTROOPER: Standing orders. Nothing anachronistic is to be taken to Earth.\nLYTTON: So instead we slaughter valuable specimens. Next time, stun lasers are to be used.\nTROOPER: It was an unfortunate mistake.\nLYTTON: Make it your last, otherwise the next execution squad will be coming for you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: Are you all right?\nDOCTOR: I can't free the TARDIS from the Time Corridor!\nTEGAN: Is there anything you can do?\nDOCTOR: No, too much turbulence. Hold on. Things must stabilise soon.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSTIEN: What if they're still in there, waiting?\nGALLOWAY: We must warn our own people.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSTIEN: Use the Time Corridor?\nGALLOWAY: You said you were a soldier. Have you no sense of loyalty?\nSTIEN: I'm a Quartermaster Sergeant. I'm not combat trained. I can't afford your sort of principles. Look at me, I'm not exactly in condition. I can't even run properly.\nGALLOWAY: You're pathetic.\nSTIEN: That too.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, we're weaving in time.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, I know.\nTEGAN: Can't we materialise?\nTURLOUGH: No, not until we're free of the Time Corridor. We risk break-up.\nTEGAN: Is that true?\nDOCTOR: Not if I have anything to do with it.\nTEGAN: Oh, no.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGALLOWAY: They've gone.\nSTIEN: They could have closed the Time Corridor down. Let's get out of here. I'm scared.\nGALLOWAY: The entrance to the corridor is round here somewhere.\nSTIEN: There's nothing there now. What was that?\nGALLOWAY: A rodent.\nSTIEN: Wearing combat boots?\nGALLOWAY: Back to the stairs, quick.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSTIEN: Can you see anything?\nGALLOWAY (OOV.): Get out of here!\nSTIEN: Galloway?\nSTIEN: Galloway!\nSTIEN: Oh, Galloway.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: What are we waiting for?\nDOCTOR: The right moment. The time stress on the TARDIS varies greatly. I'm waiting for the right moment to break out of the Time Corridor.\nTEGAN: Can I get to my room? I feel sick.\nDOCTOR: Too late, Tegan. Hold on.\nDOCTOR: Hold on!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTROOPER: Check list completed. All systems functioning.\nLYTTON: Raise the force shield. All troopers to battle stations. Battle speed!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: Doctor, I can't stand much more.\nDOCTOR: Hold on.\nDOCTOR: We're free.\nTURLOUGH: Is it over?\nDOCTOR: For the moment. Are you all right?\nTEGAN: Yes, I think so.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMERCER: I don't believe this. How long has the station been in this state?\nSTYLES: Since regular inspections ceased.\nMERCER: This place is falling to pieces.\nSTYLES: Huh. And you're seeing it on a good day. If you wanted to see everything spick and span, you shouldn't have asked for a transfer to a prison. Come on!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMERCER: How'd you cope with that mess?\nSTYLES: By ignoring it. My only concern is the medical welfare of the crew and the prisoner.\nMERCER: Isn't that rather a narrow view of your responsibilities?\nSTYLES: Oh, do shut up, will you? It's the only way to stay sane. You've only been here three days. You know nothing.\nMERCER: I've been here long enough to learn that the morale on this station is appalling.\nSTYLES: If the Captain doesn't care, why should I?\nMERCER: Why, indeed?\nSTYLES: Look, my tour of duty finishes here in eight weeks. I'm dependent on a good report from the Captain for my next promotion.\nMERCER: I see.\nSTYLES: Oh no, I don't think you do. If I don't get a good report, I could be here for another two years.\nMERCER: If Control were aware of the morale on this station, the Captain wouldn't be in command.\nSTYLES: It's been tried before, usually by inexperienced new boys like you. And the way you're carrying on, you are going to end up exactly like the others.\nMERCER: Meaning?\nSTYLES: Dead. You are the third security officer we've had here in two years. [/i]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, we're travelling parallel to the Time Corridor.\nTEGAN: Where are we going?\nTURLOUGH: Twentieth century Earth, it seems.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOSBORN: How long is your tour of duty?\nMERCER: Two years.\nOSBORN: Oh? The Captain normally allows new arrivals to settle in before subjecting them to the tedium of Officer of the Watch. What did you do?\nMERCER: I complained.\nOSBORN: Someone should have warned you.\nMERCER: I had every right. Have you seen the state of the defence system?\nOSBORN: You fear an attack?\nMERCER: That's not the point.\nOSBORN: Oh, I wouldn't worry about it. The only ship we ever see around here is our own supply vessel.\nCREWMAN: I think you may have spoken too soon. Sensors have picked up a ship in warp drive just enter the exclusion zone.\nMERCER: Inform the Captain.\nOSBORN: I wouldn't bother him. Not yet. It could be anything. Let the fighters check it out first.\nMERCER: What?\nOSBORN: They'll be grateful for the practice.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: Have you calculated where we are?\nDOCTOR: Well, the instruments are still affected by turbulence, but I think it's 1984, London. Found it!\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, where are you going?\nDOCTOR: The Time Corridor. I want to find out what all this is about.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOSBORN: Fighter leader has made visual contact. It's a battle cruiser!\nMERCER: Go to Red Alert. Inform the Captain.\nCREWMAN: Sensors report we're being scanned, sir.\nMERCER: Red Alert at once!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Such neglect. A hundred years ago this place would have been bustling with activity.\nTEGAN: It might be again when we find out who's operating the Time Corridor.\nDOCTOR: Come on. Trouble with you, Tegan, you have no imagination.\nTEGAN: That's because I can't get worked up about a load of crumbling brickwork.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMERCER: Operate the deflector shield.\nCREWMAN: Power building.\nMERCER: Seal airlocks.\nOSBORN: The battle cruiser has attacked the fighters.\nMERCER: Can we give them any supporting fire?\nOSBORN: No, not at the moment.\nCREWMAN: All but airlock three is sealed.\nMERCER: Alert maintenance.\nCREWMAN: We've been hit!\nMERCER: What's happening?\nOSBORN: Engineering report.\nMERCER: What's happening?\nOSBORN: Engineering report damage to the generating plant.\nCREWMAN: Cruiser's closing in, sir.\nOSBORN: I've lost contact with the fighters.\nMERCER: Open fire. I said, open fire!\nCREWMAN: I can't! We don't have enough power for the laser cannon. We are defenceless.\nCREWMAN: Look, we should surrender!\nMERCER: No!\nOSBORN: But we can't fight. We don't even have a deflector shield.\nSTYLES: Mercer! How much longer is this slaughter to continue?\nMERCER: Where's the Captain?\nSTYLES: Dead, along with half the crew.\nOSBORN: Battle cruiser preparing to dock.\nMERCER: Which airlock?\nOSBORN: Three. Maintenance team's still working on it.\nMERCER: I want every available man down there. Block the corridor with anything they can find.\nSTYLES: More killing?\nMERCER: Your bile would be better directed against the enemy, Doctor.\nSTYLES: How long before they dock?\nMERCER: Three minutes. We'd better go down to the airlock.\nSTYLES: Right.\nMERCER: Should we be boarded, destroy the prisoner.\nOSBORN: Good luck.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSTIEN: Don't come in here. Soldiers.\nDOCTOR: What?\nDOCTOR: He'll be all right.\nTEGAN: Look at the way he's dressed.\nDOCTOR: He must have come down the Time Corridor.\nSTIEN: You've got to help me.\nDOCTOR: What happened?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMERCER: Check how much longer the maintenance crew will be.\nSTYLES: Right.\nMERCER: The cruiser's docked.\nSTYLES: The cruiser's docked.\nMERCER: Get the shield down!\nSTYLES: Come on, pull!\nSTYLES: Pull!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSTIEN: I must rest. I'm hungry. I haven't eaten since yesterday.\nDOCTOR: Who's controlling the Time Corridor?\nSTIEN: I don't know. Have you got anything to eat?\nTEGAN: Where are you from?\nSTIEN: Earth, but not all the prisoners are from the same period. Are you sure you haven't got anything to eat?\nDOCTOR: Relax. I'm going into the warehouse.\nSTIEN: No! I told you, there are soldiers.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps they can tell us what's going on, hmm?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSTIEN: The Time Corridor's on the next level. Be careful.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMERCER: Wait until I give the order.\nCREWMAN 2: Okay.\nMERCER: Fire!\nSTYLES: Now. Now!\nDALEK: Under attack. Withdraw. Regroup.\nDALEK 2: Under attack.\nDALEK: Withdraw.\nDALEK 2: Withdraw.\nDALEKS: Withdraw. Withdraw. Withdraw.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDALEKS (OOV.): Regroup.\nLYTTON: Fools! I told you this would happen. They mined the corridor.\nBLACK: We do not want excuses. The attack must continue.\nLYTTON: Only this time, as I planned.\nDALEK: You will show more respect for the Supreme Dalek.\nLYTTON: Your battle tactics won't work. Their position is too strong.\nBLACK: You may proceed. We shall try your plan. But should you fail, you will be exterminated.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTURLOUGH: Dark, isn't it.\nDOCTOR: Look around.\nSTIEN: I can't see Galloway's body.\nTEGAN: Look, Doctor. Bullets.\nDOCTOR: Recently fired.\nTEGAN: Hardly alien.\nDOCTOR: Why advertise who you are, hmm?\nTEGAN: Where's Turlough?\nDOCTOR: Turlough?\nTEGAN: Where's he gone?\nDOCTOR: Turlough!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nARCHER: Did you hear that?\nCALDER: No, sir.\nARCHER: I thought I heard voices.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSTYLES: How long before they try again?\nMERCER: Soon.\nSTYLES: Can't we board, take the fight to them?\nMERCER: I think not.\nMERCER: Fire!\nMERCER: Masks down! Masks down!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMERCER: Move it! We're finished. It's every man for himself.\nCREWMAN: Oh, no, every man for himself?\nMERCER: Destroy the prisoner.\nOSBORN: It's not working! Come with me.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Turlough!\nARCHER: May I help you, gentlemen? This is private property.\nDOCTOR: Er, yes, I'm sorry about this. A friend of mine wandered in here by mistake, and we're looking for him.\nARCHER: I don't see him.\nLAIRD: What's going on?\nARCHER: Precisely what I'm trying to find out.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOSBORN: Come on, come on!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTROOPER: The bridge has been secured, sir.\nLYTTON: Good. We must join them.\nDALEK: The Doctor has been detained in the warehouse.\nBLACK: Despatch a Dalek. He must be brought to our ship at once.\nDALEK: I obey.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOSBORN: Oh, does nothing work properly?\nOSBORN: Try here. What's that smell?\nMERCER: Well, it can't be the prisoner.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nARCHER: Time Corridors. Alien beings. Really.\nSTIEN: You may not believe us but all we need is a minute or two more. The entrance to the Time Corridor is on this level, somewhere.\nDOCTOR: Interesting. You don't disbelieve us, do you?\nARCHER: Of course I disbelieve you. I've never heard such nonsense.\nDOCTOR: What have you discovered?\nARCHER: Nothing. Take them away.\nLAIRD: Tell them, Colonel. They've guessed most of it already.\nARCHER: Are you from the Press?\nDOCTOR: What have you found?\nARCHER: Quiet.\nDOCTOR: Tell me! Alien objects?\nARCHER: You'd better inform HQ about what's happened.\nCALDER: Okay, sir.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOSBORN: Right, explosive charges primed. What is that smell?\nOSBORN: Keep back!\nMERCER: Help me!\nOSBORN: Stay away!\nMERCER: What's happening to me?\nTROOPER: Disarmed.\nLYTTON: Release Davros.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCALDER: It's heavy static. Can't get through to HQ.\nDOCTOR: A side effect of the Time Corridor.\nARCHER: Be quiet.\nARCHER: Who's that?\nDOCTOR: Don't harm her, please. She's a friend.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: Sorry, Doctor. Look!\nARCHER: What is it?\nDOCTOR: A Dalek. Take cover!\nDALEK: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLAIRD: Where did they come from?\nSTIEN: The Time Corridor.\nLAIRD: From the ship you were on?\nSTIEN: Must be.\nLAIRD: What do they want?\nTEGAN: I hope we never find out.\nDOCTOR: Aim for the eyepiece, the stalk at the top of the dome.\nDALEK: My vision is impaired. I cannot see. My vision is impaired. I cannot see.\nDOCTOR: Quickly!\nDALEK: I cannot see. My vision is impaired. I cannot see. Warning. Warning.\nDOCTOR: Open the door!\nDALEK: I cannot see! I cannot see! Warning! Emergency!\nDOCTOR: Stand clear!\nLAIRD: She's all right. We should get her downstairs.\nDOCTOR: While you're doing that, I'd like a hand with the debris outside.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDALEK: The Dalek sent to the warehouse has been destroyed.\nBLACK: How is that possible?\nDALEK: The Doctor was aided by the Earth soldiers.\nBLACK: Seal the warehouse terminal of the Time Corridor. We will deal with the Doctor in due course.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSTYLES: Where precisely are we going?\nMERCER: Keep your mask down. There could still be gas around.\nSTYLES: So what. I'd rather die quickly than painfully of dehydration. Exactly how much longer are we going to wander around this place?\nMERCER: Look, as far as we know, there are only four of us still alive. We can't fight the Daleks alone.\nSTYLES: Only minutes ago you were prepared to fight till the bitter end.\nMERCER: And look where it got me. A dead crew.\nSTYLES: Then don't let it be for nothing.\nMERCER: What can we do?\nSTYLES: Have you forgotten? This station has a self-destruct system.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTROOPER: He's very still. Is he dead?\nLYTTON: I think not.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCALDER: Soon be ready.\nLAIRD: We could all do with something a bit stronger. How's your friend upstairs?\nCALDER: He's dead.\nDOCTOR: How is she?\nLAIRD: She's sleeping naturally.\nCALDER: Tea, sir?\nARCHER: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: Who discovered these cylinders?\nCALDER: Builders. They're converting the warehouse into flats. Thought they were unexploded bombs.\nDOCTOR: Have you tried to open one?\nLAIRD: They haven't even scratched the casing.\nARCHER: Do you think the Daleks have anything to do with this?\nDOCTOR: It would be an enormous coincidence if they didn't.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDAVROS: Who are you?\nLYTTON: Commander Lytton.\nDAVROS: Commander? My Daleks do not need troops.\nLYTTON: You'd still be in prison or dead if it weren't for my men.\nDAVROS: You speak as though my Daleks are no longer capable of war.\nLYTTON: A lot has happened during your imprisonment.\nDAVROS: The war with the Movellans is over?\nLYTTON: Yes, although casualties were very high.\nDAVROS: It is to be expected.\nLYTTON: I'm talking about Dalek casualties.\nDAVROS: Dalek casualties?\nLYTTON: They lost, Davros. They were totally defeated.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCALDER: Zero three to HQ. Zero three to HQ. Over.\nARCHER: Keep trying.\nDOCTOR: You must get reinforcements.\nCALDER: Zero three to HQ.\nARCHER: I can't conjure them out of the air. I have to find a telephone.\nLAIRD: I'll go. You're needed here.\nARCHER: This is more than a military matter now. I have to speak to the Ministry of Defence. We'll need a massive troop involvement.\nCALDER: Zero three to HQ. Zero three to HQ. Over.\nDOCTOR: I'll come with you.\nARCHER: You're the only one who knows anything about fighting Daleks. Your duty's here.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBLACK: He is a companion of the Doctor.\nDALEK: He should be destroyed.\nBLACK: He would be better used as bait. The Doctor is sentimental and emotional. He will come after the boy. This will aid the Dalek plan. Allow the boy to roam freely.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMERCER: We'll rest for a moment.\nSTYLES: Don't you get funny ideas? I'd give anything for a glass of cool spring mountain water.\nMERCER: Quiet. Down!\nMERCER: Fire!\nSTYLES: Careful.\nMERCER: Uniforms.\nSTYLES: Uniforms.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLAIRD: Here, take these. It'll help your head.\nDOCTOR: I won't be long. I must get back to my ship.\nCALDER: Sir.\nDOCTOR: I must find Turlough.\nCALDER: Yes, I understand how you feel, sir, but I must ask you to wait till the Colonel gets back.\nDOCTOR: No, no, no, no. There is isn't time. Turlough's on board the Dalek ship.\nCALDER: I'm sure the Colonel won't be long.\nSTIEN: Let him go.\nCALDER: I can't.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSOLDIER: Help!\nCALDER: Are you all right, lad?\nDOCTOR: Be careful.\nSTIEN: I was terrified it was a Dalek.\nDOCTOR: It was, or at least, the remains of one.\nCALDER: He's still alive.\nDOCTOR: We have to find it before it tries to kill again.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLYTTON: You all right?\nDAVROS: There are malfunctions in my life-support system. I require an engineer.\nLYTTON: We must board the Dalek ship.\nDAVROS: I must remain close to my cryogenic chamber. It may be necessary for me to be refrozen.\nLYTTON: There is a time factor. The space station transmitted a distress call.\nDAVROS: It will take days for a task force to arrive.\nLYTTON: Not if the signal's been intercepted by a patrol ship.\nDAVROS: Then you will shoot it down! I cannot be moved.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBLACK: Order an engineer to attend Davros.\nDALEK: We should leave here at once.\nBLACK: Without Davros, we have no future. He must be made to believe that we serve him.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSTIEN: This is a waste of time. The mutant could have escaped using the Time Corridor.\nDOCTOR: True, so why are you being so tentative in your search?\nSTIEN: We don't know for certain.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. That's why we're searching the warehouse.\nCALDER: What's it look like?\nDOCTOR: Oh, you won't mistake it. The moment you find it, it'll try and kill you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nARCHER: Gentlemen, you've saved my life. I'm Colonel Archer, Bomb Disposal Squad. I have to make an urgent call. May I use your radio?\nARCHER: Please?\nARCHER: Thank you. It's dead.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDAVROS: Tell be about the Dalek defeat.\nLYTTON: You already know most of it. The Daleks and the Movellans were locked in an impasse. Each time their respective fleets attempted a stratagem, it was instantly anticipated and countered by their opponent's battle computer.\nDAVROS: Two totally logical war machines unable to out-think each other. Fascinating. If only I'd been there.\nLYTTON: Then the Movellans found the answer.\nKISTON: Sorry, sir.\nDAVROS: Quickly, tell me.\nLYTTON: They developed a virus which exclusively attacks the Daleks. The fleet was destroyed. Those who survived went to separate parts of the universe to escape the risk of further infection and work on a cure.\nDAVROS: Have they succeeded?\nLYTTON: Not yet.\nDAVROS: So, they have returned to their creator. Like an errant child, they have come home once more, but this time they will not abuse me. This time, I shall take my rightful place as their Supreme Being, and under my control, the Daleks shall once more become triumphant!\nLYTTON: Will you be able to find an antidote?\nDAVROS: Of course.\nLYTTON: A lot of research has already been done.\nDAVROS: I am Davros. The Daleks are my creation. If necessary, I shall genetically re-engineer them. Have you finished?\nKISTON: Almost, sir.\nDAVROS: I will need a laboratory.\nLYTTON: There is one already prepared for you.\nDAVROS: I shall work here, on the station.\nLYTTON: I've explained. There isn't time.\nDAVROS: I cannot risk an accident. If the virus were to escape on board the Dalek ship\nLYTTON: Every precaution has been taken.\nDAVROS: I work here! Or not at all.\nLYTTON: I'll see what can be arranged.\nDAVROS: Hurry. There is much work to be done.\nKISTON: I've finished, sir.\nDAVROS: Close the panel.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBLACK (OOV.): I order you to obey Davros.\nLYTTON: And what happens when the task force arrives from Earth?\nBLACK (OOV.): We shall be gone. I have a plan that will force Davros to leave of his own free will. Until then, you must supply him with everything he demands. Allow him access to the Space Station's laboratory.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKISTON: As you command.\nLYTTON: What happened?\nDAVROS: A small accident.\nLYTTON: Are you all right?\nKISTON: I caught my hand. It's nothing, sir.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSTIEN: It isn't here. We haven't found the entrance to the Time Corridor, either.\nDOCTOR: Temporarily disconnected, I would think.\nCALDER: Doctor.\nSTIEN: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Nothing, nothing. Go on with the search.\nSTIEN: So much for the conqueror of the universe. I told you it had gone.\nSTIEN: Is it dead?\nDOCTOR: Would you care to take a look? How is he?\nCALDER: It's more shock than physical. Come on, lad. Let's get you downstairs. Come on, you'll be all right.\nLAIRD: What happened?\nDOCTOR: The Dalek wasn't quite dead, I'm afraid. Here, take this.\nCALDER: Give us a hand with him.\nLAIRD: Of course.\nDOCTOR: We must get back to the TARDIS. I have to find the Dalek ship.\nSTIEN: I'm not going back there. They'll kill me.\nDOCTOR: I need your help.\nSTIEN: Help? Huh. You don't know how much of a coward I am.\nDOCTOR: Well, you can take this opportunity to show me. Come along.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMERCER: Kill him!\nSTYLES: Wait. At least question him first.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: What happened? What was that shooting?\nCALDER: A small problem with a Dalek.\nTEGAN: He'd be more comfortable over here.\nLAIRD: Stay where you are.\nCALDER: It looks superficial.\nLAIRD: As long as there isn't any poison in it. Well, it was caused by an alien. We don't know what infection may have entered his bloodstream.\nCALDER: The Colonel'll be back soon, then we get the pair of them to hospital.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDAVROS: Ninety years I was frozen in that. Ninety years of mind-numbing boredom.\nLYTTON: You were conscious?\nDAVROS: Every second. The creatures of Earth have no stomach for judicial murder. They prefer to leave you to slowly rot and die. They call it being humane.\nKISTON: Then you must be equally humane in your revenge.\nDAVROS: It is a planet I shall destroy at my leisure. But first, I must deal with a meddling Time Lord.\nLYTTON: That has been anticipated.\nDAVROS: You have the Doctor?\nLYTTON: His capture is imminent.\nDAVROS: Excellent! Once I have drained his mind of all knowledge, he shall then die slowly and painfully! He has interfered for the last time.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know.\nSTEIN: What?\nDOCTOR: It's bigger inside than out.\nSTIEN: I'm going mad. Daleks, Time Corridors, now this.\nDOCTOR: Don't worry, soon be over.\nSTIEN: Yes, but will I still be sane enough to know?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSTYLES: Don't do that.\nMERCER: Hide your eyes if it offends you.\nSTYLES: Look, even an idiot like you must realise that he doesn't know anything.\nMERCER: He's not a member of the crew. He must be with the Daleks.\nTURLOUGH: I've told you, I'm from Earth.\nMERCER: Then how did you get here?\nTURLOUGH: The Dalek's Time Corridor.\nMERCER: Do you believe that?\nSTYLES: Why not? We know the Daleks are capable of time travel.\nMERCER: So we're letting him go.\nSTYLES: No, but we're not going to wait here for the Daleks to find us, either.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCALDER: Any one want some tea?\nLAIRD: No, thanks.\nTEGAN: I'd much rather have the Colonel back. How much longer is he going to be?\nCALDER: Hey, where are you going, lad? Come on, you're excused duties.\nLAIRD: Are you all right?\nCALDER: Yeah. You stay there.\nTEGAN: What's all that about?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDALEK: Activate the exit to the Time Corridor.\nDALEKS: We obey.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCALDER: Come on, lad. Nothing to worry about. It's only Sergeant Calder. Colonel's gone for an ambulance. Then you'll be all right.\nDALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: That was gunfire.\nLAIRD: Quickly. We should get out of here. Quickly.\nARCHER: There's nothing to worry about.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLYTTON: I'll inform him at once. Your laboratory is ready.\nDAVROS: Good. I will require the assistance of a chemist.\nLYTTON: Of course.\nDAVROS: And Kiston. He has proven to be a competent mechanical engineer.\nLYTTON: As you wish.\nDAVROS: Guards?\nLYTTON: An escort. There are still members of the crew still at large. It's purely a precaution.\nDAVROS: I am very difficult to kill. You should already know that.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEGAN: (quietly) That's not Colonel Archer. He gave the Doctor his gun belt, yet he's wearing one.\nARCHER: What are you two whispering about?\nLAIRD: I was wondering when the ambulance for Tegan would arrive.\nARCHER: That is in hand.\nTEGAN: And the reinforcements?\nARCHER: That is a military matter and therefore confidential.\nLAIRD: I don't think we should wait for the ambulance.\nARCHER: This warehouse is under martial law. Attempt to leave, and I'll have the pair of you shot.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: That's it. I've located the Dalek ship. Now, I could drop you off at the warehouse when I collect Tegan.\nSTIEN: I'll come with you.\nDOCTOR: Good man.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDALEK: The Doctor's TARDIS has been caught in the Time Corridor.\nBLACK: Prepare the duplication room.\nDALEK: I obey.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Turlough?\nDOCTOR: Turlough? Foolish boy.\nDOCTOR: Quickly, let's get out of here.\nSTIEN: No, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: This is madness. The Daleks won't thank you for capturing me. They'll kill you.\nSTIEN: I didn't quite tell you the truth. I serve the Daleks. I'm a Dalek agent.\nDALEKS: Exterminate the Doctor. Exterminate the Doctor. Exterminate the Doctor. Exterminate. Exterminate! Exterminate!\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Friday night crowds...\nKaren: Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic.\nJim: Agoraphobic?\nKaren: Yeah.\nJim: Really?\nKaren: Yeah! You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.\nJim: Absolutely correct.\nKevin: Later, Jim.\nJim: Kev, have a good weekend.\nKaren: Bye. Ok, so this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna suck it up.\nJim: Here we go...\nKaren: ...and we're gonna go to dinner.\nJim: Ok...\nKaren: And then we're gonna go to the movies.\nJim: Sounds good.\nRoy: Hey Halpert!\nJim: Hey... [Roy lunges towards Jim]\nPam: ROY!\nKaren: [shrieks]\nPam: Roy don't! [Dwight pepper-sprays Roy]\nRoy: [screams in pain] Ahh God!\nDwight: Pam, please call security!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: No need for consternation, everything is under control.\nJan: Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!\nMichael: It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.\nJan: [sigh] Is Toby there?\nMichael: No...\nToby: I'm... here, Jan.\nJan: Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?\nToby: Well, we fired Roy, obviously. And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company.\nJan: Thank God.\nToby: Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...\nMichael: No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.\nJan: All right, well are you gonna take care of this?\nMichael: Yeppers.\nJan: What did I tell you about \"yeppers?\"\nMichael: I don't... remember.\nJan: I told you not to say it. Do you remember that?\nMichael: Yeesh...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPam: I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened. It sucked.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy. Thank you.\nDwight: Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.\nJim: Okay. Um... Got you something.\nDwight: Don't want it.\nJim: You don't know what it is.\nDwight: Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOscar: Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up.\nKevin: Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.\nOscar: It was crazy.\nAngela: You saw it? Describe it please.\nOscar: Well, I heard some shouting. And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something. Roy stomps over there. All of the sudden, BAM. Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.\nAngela: Oh...\nOscar: It was insane!\nAngela: [flustered] Well... good for Dwight.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.\nJim: Where'd you get that?\nMichael: Wikipedia.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Wikipedia... is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.\nJim: Hey, Mike. Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.\nMichael: Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think... [mumbling softly] that maybe you should... [mumbling jibberish]\nJim: I can't hear you.\nMichael: What I'm saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish]\nJim: Still nothin'.\nMichael: Ok, see what I did?\nJim: No.\nMichael: By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.\nJim: Nice.\nMichael: Ok, let's try another one. Um...\nJim: Okay.\nMichael: Walking out of the room unexpectedly.\nJim: And what happens in this one?\nMichael: It's a surprise.\nJim: Okay.\nMichael: Go ahead, ask me for a raise.\nJim: Can I have a raise?\nMichael: [gets up and begins to walk out of the room]\nJim: [softly] s*x, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.\nMichael: What?\nJim: What?\nMichael: No, what did you say?\nJim: I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what happened.\nMichael: Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.\nToby: Which is where?\nDwight: Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end.\nToby: Thanks Dwight.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKelly: That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.\nRyan: I can't imagine what I would have done.\nKelly: I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.\nRyan: Well that was funny, that's why.\nKelly: Oh it was?\nRyan: Mm-hmm.\nKelly: Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...\nRyan: Okay.\nKelly: ...and you call me, to calm you down...\nRyan: You know what? I didn't---\nToby: Can you stop...\nKelly: ...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not.\nToby: There's a bunch of people back here, maybe...\nRyan: Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...\nToby: Guys...\nKelly: I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nToby: I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly. But, if he did intend that? Wow. Genius.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: [knock on door] Yeah.\nDarryl: You ready for me?\nMichael: Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat.\nDarryl: Cool.\nMichael: You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room.\nDarryl: Okay.\nMichael: No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: [long pause] I am declining to speak first.\nDarryl: Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.\nMichael: Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.\nDarryl: Are you wearin' lady clothes?\nMichael: What?\nDarryl: Are you wearin' lady clothes? Those look like lady... pants.\nMichael: No, this is a power suit.\nDarryl: That there's a woman's suit.\nMichael: [Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again.\nDarryl: I'ma call Roy, man.\nMichael: Ohh... kay.\nDarryl: This is gonna make him feel better.\nMichael: All right.\nDarryl: This is too good.\nMichael: Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?\nPam: Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!\nKevin: You're wearing a woman's suit?\nMichael: No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKevin: Who makes it?\nMichael: Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.\nPhyllis: Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?\nMichael: Okay.\nPhyllis: Did you see...\nMichael: Would you stop it, please?\nJim: So, none of that tipped you off?\nMichael: It's European, OK? It's a European cut.\nPam: Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.\nMichael: No, they don't. See? [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam]\nPam: [Laughing, covering her mouth]\nMichael: Italians don't wear pockets.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPam: It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKaren: Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?\nMichael: No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.\nDarryl: Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.\nMichael: Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.\nDarryl: Okay, can you just stand right there? [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKevin: Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?\nKaren: I feel great, Kevin. Thank you.\nStanley: You must have been scared out of your mind.\nKaren: Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.\nAngela: What happened, exactly? I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.\nKaren: Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.\nAngela: Mm-hmm.\nKaren: And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.\nAngela: [flustered] Goodness.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKaren: When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings. Roy just attacked him. I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.\nDarryl: Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. With Roy gone we got a smaller crew. And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.\nMichael: [mumbles jibberish]\nDarryl: What? I can't hear you.\nMichael: [mumbling softly] That was a very good point.\nDarryl: I can't--- what, Mike? Are you---\nMichael: [mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPam: Sorry I almost got you killed.\nJim: Yeah, that was nuts.\nPam: He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right?\nJim: No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.\nPam: Not anymore. It's, um... It's completely over now.\nJim: We'll see. I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.\nPam: Jim... I am really... sorry.\nJim: Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.\nDarryl: Why can't I just... tell you?\nMichael: Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes.\nDarryl: There you go.\nMichael: Oh. [scoffs] Come on. Be serious.\nDarryl: I am serious, Mike. That's a 10% raise. That's what I want.\nMichael: I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.\nDarryl: Come on, be for real Mike.\nMichael: I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub.\nDarryl: [laughs] Are you serious? You're earning this?\nMichael: Plus perks, yes.\nDarryl: Mike, this is barely more than I make. You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]\nMichael: Fourteen years.\nDarryl: Ho-ho!\nMichael: No, please, please...\nDarryl: Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one. [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]\nMichael: Ok, let's take 15, again.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.\nDwight: When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?\nJim: Boy I---\nDwight: No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating.\nKaren: Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.\nJim: Well... yes, that's probably what it is. So what do I do?\nKaren: Hmm... I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKevin: Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.\nMichael: Oh, thank you.\nKevin: Yeah. I heard you might need it. So...\nCreed: Here's the $40 you gave me.\nMichael: I didn't give you $40.\nCreed: In a way you did.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nStanley: Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDarryl: [on cell phone] Fourteen years. Fourteen. I know. [laughing] Ok, alright. I gotta go. Later. [hangs up]\nMichael: Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia.\nDarryl: What?\nMichael: I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.\nDarryl: That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.\nMichael: Well what am I supposed to do?\nDarryl: Get your own raise. You gotta get out there and earn, son.\nMichael: I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous.\nDarryl: Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put you in charge. Okay, and we're shippin' more now than we ever have.\nMichael: [exhales] That's true.\nDarryl: Yeah that's true. You gotta call your girl, and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.\nMichael: You know what? I should.\nDarryl: Yeah, you should.\nMichael: I have been a loyal employee for a long time.\nDarryl: Fourteen years long.\nMichael: You know what? I deserve a bump.\nDarryl: Make it happen, cap'in.\nMichael: I am makin' it happen, sergeant.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCreed: I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30. Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what. I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car. [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that. So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels. Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---\nAngela: You're useless.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJan: Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?\nMichael: No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today.\nJan: Today. All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?\nMichael: Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away.\nJan: Great. Uh, and listen. Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.\nMichael: Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.\nJan: Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?\nMichael: Mm-hm.\nJan: No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep. So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.\nMichael: Hey, I'd rather kill myself.\nJan: Michael, he's your branch's HR rep...\nMichael: [talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible. Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.\nJan: ...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship. You know this. Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.\nMichael: [sighs] Fine.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKelly: You are so mean.\nRyan: I don't know what you're talking about.\nKelly: Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid.\nRyan: No, I said your idea was stupid.\nMichael: Toby, come on. Let's go.\nToby: Where?\nMichael: Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go.\nKelly: What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?\nToby: Alright.\nKelly: Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.\nRyan: Don't you see why that's insane?\nKelly: Oh, so I'm crazy now?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDarryl: Comfortable, Mike?\nMichael: Yeah. Fine.\nDarryl: How about you, man. Comfortable?\nToby: No.\nMichael: [imitating Chris Tucker] Don't ever touch a black man's radio! ...Chris Tucker. Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way.\nDarryl: Thank you.\nMichael: Well...\nDarryl: I haven't been to New York in a long time.\nMichael: Mm, the Big Apple.\nDarryl: Maybe I'll stay overnight. Got a cousin lives down there.\nToby: How would we get home?\nDarryl: Oh you could stay too. He's got a big place.\nMichael: Maybe I'll stay.\nDarryl: Mm, it's not that big.\nMichael: Well...\nDarryl: Busses, though. They get you home quick.\nMichael: [mouth full of pretzels] Oh, I...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKelly: And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like \"No!\"\nAngela: Then what'd he do? [Kelly's phone rings]\nKelly: You should just read the report that Toby did. He took everyone's stories. [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly. Oh yeah I could totally help you with that. Ok, let me just get the folder out. Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper. Oh, 12 reams...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nHunter: Hey guys, Jan is ready for you.\nDarryl: Okay, bring it home now. And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.\nMichael: Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.\nDarryl: Yes sir. Remember that. I'll be right outside if you need me\nMichael: All right.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDarryl: Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRoy: [to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions \"Don't worry about it\"] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?\nPam: I don't know.\nRoy: Please. I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]\nKevin: [as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!\nJim: Thanks, Kev. I'm good though.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJan: Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello. Come in. [exhales] Ah, Okay.\nMichael: Who's the boy toy?\nJan: That's my new assistant.\nMichael: Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?\nJan: I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?\nMichael: Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.\nToby: Hi, Jan.\nJan: Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation. All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside. Are we clear?\nMichael: Pippity poppity.\nJan: Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.\nMichael: Six percent? After all we've been through?\nJan: Oh, God.\nMichael: I got you... jade earrings.\nJan: Michael---\nMichael: No!\nJan: Michael---\nMichael: No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more s*x. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball?\nToby: Just preparing for the deposition.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nToby: This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold s*x from a female superior. It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRoy: I'm so sorry, Pammy. I really wasn't gonna do anything. But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and... I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong.\nPam: I'm sorry too. I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.\nRoy: So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?\nPam: Um... no. No, he has a girlfriend.\nRoy: Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy.\nPam: No, there were a lot of reasons.\nRoy: But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam.\nPam: I know.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: What's this?\nJim: What's what?\nDwight: Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department. \"Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man. Dwight K. Schrute\"\nJim: Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice... honor.\nDwight: Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look. There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.\nJim: [under his breath] Didn't think you'd notice...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart. This is me, Jan. This is me!\nJan: Okay, Michael. Please, why don't we just take a break. This is really going nowhere.\nMichael: Okay, no, no, no, no. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere.\nJan: Ok, Toby, how about if you...\nToby: Sure.\nJan: Great.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJan: What's wrong with you?\nMichael: Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I---\nJan: Okay, Michael. I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.\nMichael: Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---\nJan: No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it. Okay?\nMichael: Ah, so... All right, Levinson. Here's the rub. I would like a 15% raise.\nJan: No. But we can offer you 12.\nMichael: But you just said 15.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMichael: Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win win win. But you know, life is about more... than just salaries. It's about perks. Like having s*x with Jan--\nJan: Michael!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nStanley: So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?\nPhyllis: Mm-hmm, near the river.\nStanley: Mm, how many bedrooms?\nPhyllis: Four.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAngela: Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading.\nDwight: Really?\nAngela: Mm-hmm. Tales of bravery.\nDwight: Mm, good stuff.\nAngela: Mm-hmm. I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.\nDwight: Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJim: [scoffs] I... will never say a word. And now, we are even.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell. On time. Now I'm back. Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it. [in a forceful voice] So look out Dunder Mifflin! [laughs] [snaps] I mean, look out... in a fun way! You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAndy: Hey guys! Guess who's back! [Dwight pepper-spray's Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD!\nDwight: No need to thank me.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDwight: I am not a hero. I am a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero?

But you're seeing me one billionth of a second ago.\nCasey : So... everything is history and relationships are just memories.\nMax : Except for the light.\nCasey : Which is in its own present, our past and someone else's future.\nMax : The Hawking of Hearts.\nCasey : You know what that means?\nZBZ HOUSE - Casey & Ashleigh's room Casey just wakes up. She was dreaming...\nCasey : What? Why are you staring at me?\nAshleigh : You were making out with your pillow.\nCasey : No, I wasn't!\nAshleigh : Must have been an awesome dream. You were drooling.\nCasey : I don't drool! Much. KT HOUSE - Living room\nRusty : All right. Lightning round.

Ferret.\nPickle : He is such a romantic.\nRusty : Afraid of apricots?\nBen Bennett : Wingnut!\nPickle : That's Heath.\nRusty : Heath is correct. Wingnut?\nBen Bennett : This active recognition test is gonna be tough. I mean, likes, dislikes, embarrassing secrets...\nPickle : I know more about the actives now than I ever wanted to know.\nRusty : Except for this guy. Joshua Whopper.\nPickle : Isn't that the guy who's always carrying a knife?\nRusty : Whoever it is, we better figure it out or we're scrubbing toilets until initiation.\nBeaver : Empty your wallets.\nBen Bennett : Why?\nHeath : Lunch buffet.\nRusty : You're shaking us down for a strip club?\nBeaver : It's not just any strip club. It's Gentlemen's Choice. We need to make a Cappie trip.\nRusty : Last time Cappie went to the strip club was when he was...

This is a trap. We have no idea who Joshua Whopper is. Which means, when Cappie said, \"Trust me,\" he probably meant, \"Don't trust me. Which means Josh Whopper is going to be on the active recognition test. And after every one of us fails we're going to be breaking out the gas masks, Hazmat suits, and we're gonna go on porcelain patrol until initiation.

You're probably wondering what I'm doing here.\nMax : Would... Actually, I was thinking about... That's not really relevant now. So...\nCasey : I really need a tutor for Intro to Astronomy. And I know it's not your major specifically, but Rusty mentioned you had some connection to NASA. Which got me thinking... I really need help with the class. Max... NASA... So I'm here.\nMax : Maybe this isn't such a good idea. It didn't go too well with blackjack and Casino Night.\nCasey : Well, I'm big on second chances.

Although \"Knocked Up\" runs a close second.\nMichael : But don't you think Judd Apatow's movies can be... a little misogynistic, kind of homophobic?\nCalvin : Was it the chest waxing thing?\nMichael : No, it was the \"you know how I know you're gay\" thing. It objectifies gay life.\nCalvin : So now you're gonna teach me about being gay? If I recall, last night I taught you a few things.\nMichael : A point taken. But how many other gay people do you hang out with? I mean, besides me?\nCalvin : Is that a trick question? Fine. None.\nMichael : Then you have to admit that your world view is slightly limited. Which is... why I was thinking we could go to Gentlemen's Choice.\nCalvin : You want to go to a strip club?\nMichael : No, the other Gentlemen's Choice. The hottest... Well... only gay bar in Cyprus. We'll meet up with some of my friends, we'll hang out.\nCalvin : Trash Judd Apatow...\nMichael : You've never been to a gay bar, have you?\nCalvin : I just don't really like tight shirts and guys in Daisy Dukes.\nMichael : Don't mock what you don't know. Besides, that's not Gentlemen's Choice. Come on. It wouldn't hurt you to actually hang out with other gay people every now and then. Who knows. Maybe you'll even meet a friend or two. It's time to broaden your horizons.\nCalvin : Spread my big gay wings?\nCRU - Dormtroms\nMax : So you break through the line and no one touches you, you keep on rolling. That's inertia.

You hit the quarterback, knock him out cold. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\nGuy : Hell, yeah.\nCasey : Max, I was hoping to understand gamma ray bursts.\nMax : OK, yeah. That's a rocket of electromagnetic energy created by a collapsing star. Kind of a good and bad thing if one heads our way.\nCasey : Bad first.\nMax : Well, the world would plunge into darkness, polar ice caps would melt and deep sea creatures would rule the earth.\nCasey : And the good?\nMax : Well, no more student loans.\nCasey : Got it. But that would never happen, right?\nMax : Casey. No matter how invested you are in your view of the universe, you have to be prepared for things to change.\nCasey : Are we talking about gamma rays or something else?\nMax : I don't know...

That sounds great. I'm gonna be a naturalist intern.\nCasey : You'll have to wear hiking boots.\nAshleigh : So, how was your tutoring session?\nCasey : I'm less confused about astronomy and more confused about Max. OK, here it goes. I kind of like him.\nAshleigh : Oh, he's cute. Weird, but cute. So, how was it? Was it all gushy and romantic? Or did he get all science-y and weird?\nCasey : Neither. Both. I don't know. Honestly, I'm not sure what happened.\nAshleigh : Wait. He's not just an Evan/Cappie in a dork suit, is he?\nCasey : No, that's the strange thing. He's totally unlike Evan or even Cappie. Max is so far outside my normal dating pool, I can't read him at all. It's like all the usual fraternity/sonority dating rituals have been tossed out the window. We're from different planets.\nAshleigh : You need a translator. Someone who can speak both Greek and geek.\nKT HOUSE - Cappie's room\nCappie : French maid, hers. Amazon princess, hers.\nRusty : What happened with you and Rebecca?\nCappie : We figured we were headed in different directions, so better to cut it off now before anyone got hurt. Devil temptress, hers. Super chick. That's mine. Where are the bracelets?\nRusty : And you're OK?\nCappie : You mean do I need to go and get hammered at Gentlemen's Choice, pay a bunch of naked girls to pretend they love me? No. That sounds like fun.\nRusty : You're not joshing me?\nCappie : Nope. I'm not joshing you. Oh, let's see. Margaret Thatcher. Mine.\nRusty : Margaret Thatcher was one whopper of a prime minister? Maybe she was listening to Josh Groban, watching Judge Wapner.\nCappie : I'll bite.\nRusty : I know who Joshua Whopper is.\nCappie : No. You don't.\nRusty : Oh, yeah, I do. Dozens of majors, secretive about his name, smarter than he lets on and he was walking out of Lasker Parks Hall. I saw him. He's you. You're him.\nCappie : Rusty, you don't want to go there.\nRusty : Why not? I figured it out, didn't I? I know your real name.\nCappie : You don't. Because if you dug a little deeper, Nancy Drew, you would have discovered that Joshua Whopper has been a student at CRU since 1984, which just so happens was a dark time for the Kappa Taus. \"Thanks to the invention of the microchip, CRU was finally able to track grades by computer. And the administration began to enforce Greek minimum grade point averages. It didn't appear that the Kts would survive. The only person in the house making grades was a pledge. Lasker Parks, a computer science geek.\"\nRusty : Lasker Parks? He invented the...\nCappie : Uh, Spitter, don't interrupt. \"So, Lasker enlisted his pledge class for help. They stole the password to the university mainframe and for their pledge project they created Joshua Whopper, a computer program. A safeguard to ensure that the Kts will never again fall prey to grade standards. Every semester the program chooses random large classes and enrolls Joshua Whopper and awards him an A.\"\nRusty : So, the less attention Joshua Whopper gets, the better.\nCappie : Yeah. And don't tell the pledges about him. This is something you're supposed to learn as an active.\nRusty : Well, why do we even need him? It's...\nCappie : Have you seen our grades? Without Josh they would have shut us down years ago. So, you understand why this has to remain a secret?\nRusty : Totally. Oh. Hey, you forgot this.\nCappie : Nope. That's mine.\nEXT. CRU\nAshleigh : So, it turns out a food service coordinator is actually...\nCalvin : The guy who makes the French fries.\nAshleigh : Exactly. Which is why I told him I'd go broke keeping my pores clean.\nCalvin : I'm sure they understood.\nAshleigh : I know, right? Plus, if I took the job I'd have even less time to see you.\nCalvin : Yeah, I know. It has gotten pretty intense with Michael and me.\nAshleigh : I knew you guys would hit it off. Hey, why don't we all go to Dobler's tonight? You treat this time and then I'll pay when I get a... Maybe... Maybe I could be a bouncer.\nCalvin : I'm actually hanging out with Michael tonight.\nAshleigh : That's... good.\nCalvin : But you should come.\nAshleigh : Really?\nCalvin : Yeah. I wouldn't mind the company. We're going to Gentlemen's Choice.\nAshleigh : The strip club?\nCalvin : No, the other one.\nAshleigh : Oh. Yay !\nCRU - Dale & Rusty's room\nDale : ... is afraid of the color green, has never eaten chicken, and likes to chase geese?\nRusty : Jeremy.\nDale : Dude, do you honestly want these guys to be your brothers? I don't even know how most of these kids got into CRU. And what kind of parents name their kid Ferret?\nRusty : You promised not to disparage.\nDale : I'm sorry. I'm just not impressed, that's all. Here's a winner. \"Barks at parked cars.\"\nRusty : That's Pillbox.\nDale : Sadly correct. This guy has some promise. Smart, stable, good family life. Real name?\nRusty : I don't know. I give up.\nDale : Joshua Whopper. Someone knock on door...\nRusty : I think we're done.\nDale : Who is this guy? Is he smarter than me? Rusty opens the door...\nDale : Hey, Casey. Just... helping out your little brother here. You know, 'cause I care.\nCasey : Rusty, can I talk to you for a sec? In private?\nRusty : Sure.\nDale : No, no. You guys don't have to leave. I'll just, uh, listen to my music. You know, meditate. Expand my mind.\nRusty : What's up?\nCasey : Rusty. There's someone on the honors engineering floor who I kind of like.\nRusty : Here?\nCasey : I kind of like... Max.\nRusty : I should warn him.\nCasey : What do you mean?\nRusty : 'Cause you date like Sherman marched, Casey. With scorched Earth and broken spirits left in your wake.\nCasey : OK, A: ouch, and B: all I need you to d is find out if he likes me. That's it.\nRusty : That's just way too junior high dating strategy.\nCasey : How would you know?\nRusty : OK, A: ouch. And B: because I read your diary.\nCasey : Fine. Please, Rusty. Please, Rusty, please!\nRusty : OK. Stop, stop. All right, I'll do it.\nCasey : I knew I could count on you, little brother.\nRusty : I'm the best.\nCasey : Yes, you are. Casey leaves...\nDale : Max? Really? The guy's a freakin' loser. KT HOUSE - Hallway Someone ring the frontdoor bell...Cappie opens the door...\nWoman : Hi. I'm looking for Joshua Whopper.\nCappie : Why would you... Why would you need to do that?\nWoman : I'm Claire Golan, Dr. Shapiro's TA, and after some students came to Dr. Shapiro looking for him she checked her midterms. His test is missing, which means Dr. Shapiro's gonna kill me.\nCappie : Well, Claire, I'm sorry to hear that, but it was nice knowing you.\nWoman : Then she'll take it to the Gender Studies Review Board, then the Academic Review Board.\nCappie : All those people will have to meet Joshua Whopper?\nWoman : Yes, they would. Unless I can get this all cleared up.\nCappie : Today's your lucky day, because... I'm Joshua Whopper.\nWoman : You are? Great. Then would tonight be OK, 9:00?\nCappie : Sure. For what?\nWoman : For the make up midterm. While the material's still fresh?\nCappie : Tonight, tonight?\nWoman : That's so cool of you. You're a total lifesaver.\nCappie : Hey, Claire, I'm taking two gender studies classes with Dr. Shapiro. Which one is this again?\nWoman : The Phallus. CRU - Max's room\nRusty : So, you're tutoring my sister now?\nMax : Yeah, we only did it once. No, I mean tutoring. I'm not... I didn't... I wasn't saying that...\nRusty : OK, thank you. Good to know.\nDale : I've won a lot of awards too, Max. A lot bigger than the... National Science Foundation gold medal.\nMax : Oh, that one. I assisted Professor Lowy with his work on fuel cell technology. Dale, maybe you can answer this. Why do they always put the environmental awards on the wooden plaques?\nDale : Nobody likes a show-off, Max.\nRusty : But with all that studying and tutoring, I bet you don't have much time to date.\nMax : No. Not really.\nDale : European Science Foundation Legion of Honor?\nMax : Ah, the Neues Schloss Hotel in Zurich is pretty cool.\nRusty : It's hard to tell if they like you as much as you like them. So you test the waters...\nMax : Agreed. Maybe... maybe it'd be smart to... ask a family member. See if the other person's interested...\nDale : For heaven's sake, will somebody just say what they really mean? Max, I demand to know your intentions.\nMax : Is he all right?\nRusty : Apparently not. Who's that? She's pretty. Is that your sister?\nMax : Girlfriend.\nDale : Thank you. ZBZ HOUSE - Living room\nCasey : I don't get it. I asked him to tutor me. Why didn't he just say he had a girlfriend?\nRusty : Why would he do that?\nCasey : You're kidding, right? Asking him to tutor me meant I was interested in going out. If he has a girlfriend he should have said no.\nRusty : What would you say if you just wanted him to help you with your class?\nCasey : That I wanted him to tutor me. You really didn't pay very close attention to my diary. You know what? I'm bowing out before this gets super complicated. This is what you get when you try to date amateurs. Will you make sure Max gets it? I owe him for an hour of tutoring. Rusty's cellphone rings...\nRusty : Hey, Cap ! What's, uh... OK, I'll be right there. A few minutes later...In the dining room...\nAshleigh : Looks like we have a 1066 here.\nRebecca : Serial killer?\nAshleigh : Major crime alert. I'm thinking of becoming a student security officer.\nRebecca : Their uniforms are hideous.\nAshleigh : OK, you know what you need?\nRebecca : A bigger spoon?\nAshleigh : An evening out with me and Calvin at Gentlemen's Choice.\nRebecca : The strip club?\nAshleigh : No. The other one.\nRebecca : I'll take a pass. I'm not in the mood to hang out in a bar packed with guys.\nAshleigh : But these guys are exactly what you need. Gay bars are tailor made for depressed straight girls. There's lots of great music, hot guys that don't hit on you, and all night they tell you you're fabulous. KT HOUSE - Cappie's room\nRusty : All right, lightning round. Who said a male's masculinity is defined by his relationship with not only his but a woman's phallatical display?\nCappie : I have no idea, but it sounds kind of he-she.\nRusty : No offense, but we're screwed. This books are scary thick and I can't even wrap my head around the class description in the syllabus. \"The thrust of the phallus is how perceptions of masculinity affect psycho, social and interpersonal relationships.\"\nCappie : Rusty, don't go soft on me.\nRusty : Cap, I'm beat. This class is really hard. I just can't cram it in fast enough.\nCappie : All right. We need a helping hand. Reach under those books.\nRusty : What are you thinking?\nCappie : We get everybody in here, we bang our heads together, everyone pitches in. If Joshua Whopper's going down he's not taking the rest of us with him. Clearly we've all taken gender roles for granted.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKT HOUSE - Living room\nBeaver : I've never had such clarity before. Maybe we'd be better brothers if we treated each other as sisters.\nHeath : An open exchange of feelings.\nBeaver : Sadly, it appears our phalluses have led us astray.\nCappie : I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you, too.\nBeaver : Now I know I have a heart... because it's breaking.\nCappie : And, uh... I think I'm gonna miss you most of all, Scarecrow.\nRusty : I'm going with you.\nCappie : Right. Sorry.\nHeath : Hey, Beav, are you... Are you crying?\nBeaver : Yes, and I don't care. But I didn't get you anything.\nBen Bennett : Later. Just take a sip.\nPickle : We were thinking about going to the backyard, just blowing some stuff up.\nAll : Yes! ZBZ HOUSE - Hallway\nMax : Hey, Casey? Sorry to bother you. I came to return your check. I can't cash it.\nCasey : I had a feeling you weren't going to make this easy.\nMax : No, it's not...\nCasey : Look. I gave you a check. It's yours. Do what you want. Consider it a lovely parting gift. Clearly, you have some issues. You need to work them out, and I wish you luck with those.\nMax : No, Casey, you didn't sign the bottom of it.\nCasey : Right. Great. So I'll just get a pen, then.\nMax : Casey, wait. He Kisses her...\nMax : Hmm...Bye... ZBZ HOUSE - Casey& Ashleigh's room\nCasey : And then he just left. No, fled. Fled is more the word. He does that a lot. He's so weird. I don't even know why I care.\nAshleigh : Well, how was it?\nCasey : What? The kiss? It was... great. Really great. Which pisses me off even more.\nAshleigh : Why?\nCasey : Because even with all those brains he's just Evan in a dork suit. He has a girlfriend, remember?\nAshleigh : Well, maybe he's looking to turn his twosome into a threesome.\nCasey : Max? Please. He's the sweetest... least corruptible guy in the world.\nAshleigh : It's always the quiet ones.\nCasey : Well, then I'm just gonna yell at him, Ash. Perfect. Where are you going?\nAshleigh : Calvin is meeting Rebecca and I at Gentlemen's Choice. Do you want to come? You're going with Calvin to a strip club?\nCasey : No, the other one. GENTLEMEN'S CHOICE (The Other One)\nMichael : What do you think?\nCalvin : It's not so scary. Kind of nice.\nMichael : And maybe you'll find another gay guy on the planet to talk to.\nCalvin : Yeah. Chances of that are highly unlikely.\nMichael : I got it.\nCalvin : Heath.\nHeath : Hey. Calvin.\nCalvin : Heath, this is my boyfriend, Michael.\nMichael : Hi, Michael. You guys know each other?\nHeath : Yeah. I'm a Kappa Tau. He's an Omega Chi. We're like, locked in mortal combat.\nMichael : Mortal enemies. I got it.\nAshleigh : Calvin ! Hey ! You want to go this way?\nMichael : Hey, Calvin. The plan was for you to hang out with gay guys, not straight girls.\nCalvin : I know, but Ashleigh called me and said Rebecca needed a pick-me-up. Bad breakup.\nMichael : Say no more. Me and my buddies will handle it.\nCalvin : So, where's Greg?\nHeath : I don't know. We broke up about a month ago.\nCalvin : You broke up with Greg.\nHeath : Yeah.\nGuy : Can't we take the night off?\nMichael : Duty calls. If straight guys weren't so insensitive then we wouldn't be left to pick up the pieces. But they are so this is part of the job. OK, go.\nGay Guy : Oh, my God. You two look so fabulous. And crazy hot. Are you gonna dance with me or am I gonna have to call my friends over for some help?\nRebecca : We'll dance.\nAshleigh : See?\nHeath : First time here?\nCalvin : Yeah, first time.\nHeath : What do you think?\nCalvin : It's OK. Michael wanted me to make some new friends. Preferably ones that weren't into Judd Apatow.\nHeath : You know how I know you're gay?\nBoth : You're in Gentlemen's Choice. CRU - Class\nCappie : Then Lacan stated that man finds satisfaction for his demand for love in the relation with the woman. And as much as the signifier of the phallus constitutes her as giving in love, which she does not have.\nRusty : Yes. What about Furhagen?\nCappie : The relationship between man and woman beyond the phallus is the very same as the relationship between the subject and the real of its body.\nRusty : Yes, yes. What about...?\nCappie : You know, Spitter, the answer to every question is the same. The phallus half of the relationship has a tendency to screw things up.\nRusty : Cap?\nCappie : I couldn't step up for Rebecca. I couldn't change. She need more. She need real support and I couldn't give it to her. So... I miss her. EXT. Calhoun Hall\nCasey : There you are. Hey, tutor. I just have one last question. Did you think that kissing me would make me somehow want you more? Who do you think you are?\nMax : That's two questions.\nCasey : Regardless of what you might have heard, I'm no longer about crazy, dysfunctional triangles. I'm not going to be a one man girl to a guy who's a two girl man. I mean, why can't anyone just have a normal relationship? Is that so difficult?\nMax : No.\nCasey : What would your girlfriend say if she knew what you were up to?\nMax : She's not exactly my girlfriend anymore.\nCasey : If she's not exactly your girlfriend anymore, then why would you call her your girlfriend to Rusty? And why do you keep a picture of her? Did she break your heart or something?\nMax : Yeah.\nCasey : I get it. It's tough. Trust me. I am the queen of not letting go. But you've got to move on.\nMax : My girlfriend's dead.\nCasey : Good progress. I know it seems harsh, but admitting that she's dead to you is the first step to moving on. You know, I had to do the same thing with my last boyfriend. It's not like we don't all have old ghosts.\nMax : My girlfriend, she really is dead. We met freshman year in the dorms. And then just before junior year she discovered this tiny lump on her neck. That's when it started.\nCasey : I'm sorry, Max. When did she die?\nMax : About six months ago.\nCasey : You know, when I was 17, Rusty had this cat that nobody liked. Nobody except for him. She was kind of a cross between a Bengal and an actual Bengal tiger. The day I was nominated for prom queen I wanted to celebrate, so I borrowed my mom's car. And I hadn't driven much, so I was nervous. Then when I pulled out of the garage...\nMax : You drove over the cat.\nCasey : And I just compared a dead cat to your girlfriend who died of cancer. It's just I've never... known anyone who died. Except for Rusty's cat.\nMax : It's OK. You're not the first person who's done it.\nCasey : Do people talk about cats?\nMax : I get a lot of different reactions when I talk about her. Which is usually why I try to just avoid the subject all together. It's... It's still tough. You know? And I guess that's why I haven't really gone out with anyone since she died.\nCasey : Got you.\nMax : Casey. I don't think now is a good time. And it's not you feeling weird. It's me too. I thought I would be over her, ready to move on. But the more I'm... more I'm around you, the more I think of her. And I just... I like thinking about her.\nCasey : Well, maybe we should both just say good night. Good night, Max. KT HOUSE - Basement\nCappie : What is Beaver's favorite color?\nRusty : Chartreuse.\nBeaver : Reminds me of beer.\nHeath : Why do we call Brother Doug \"Corn Nuts?\"\nRusty : Myrtle Beach. He went out for a salty ocean swim, laid out naked and roasted his... corn nuts.\nBeaver : OK, last question, Pledge Spitter. Cappie is your big brother. Tell us something about him that only you would know that you've learned in the last 24 hours.\nRusty : Cappie's not Joshua Whopper.\nCappie : They gout. My clean a bruder.\nBeaver : Turn around!\nEXT. CRU\nMichael : What do you want to do tonight?\nCalvin : I suppose watching Superbad would be out of the question?\nMichael : If you agree to go to a seminar on queer musicology.\nCalvin : Yeah, I guess the Apatow Dvds will stay in the closet.\nMichael : Then how about Gentlemen's Choice?\nCalvin : You know, I liked that.\nMichael : Yeah? I noticed. You never mentioned that you knew a Kappa Tau.\nCalvin : Heath? We... met during rush, you know. It's no big deal.\nAshleigh comes...\nAshleigh : Oh, my God. I got the job.\nGirl : And you can start your first exciting campus tour next week.\nAshleigh : Oh, my god! I have a job! KT HOUSE - Party\nRusty : Hey cap. I'm sorry for messing things up with Joshua Whopper.\nCappie : It's OK.\nRusty : We can always depend on you. You're the one who got the A in Shapiro's make up exam.\nCappie : I got lucky. It actually turned out to be one of the best classes I've never taken.\nRusty : You know, sometimes people can change. It just takes the right person. Even phalluses... can grow.\nCappie : You should be ashamed of yourself, Spittles. To Joshua Whopper. Too bad Joshua couldn't make his own party. After his stellar showing of the phallus, he's back to work doing what he does best. Making our house a little bit better. Because Joshua Whopper embodies the very best of Kappa Tau. He's unselfish, dedicated and he's always willing to put his brothers first. To Joshua Whopper. CRU - Astronomy class\nCasey : Andromeda, Pleiades... Orion's belt, Big Dipper, and....\nMax : Lyra. Ashleigh said you might be here.\nCasey : This is the only part of the class I enjoy. But after a while it all starts looking the same.\nMax : The trick to the constellations is to know the stories behind them. Lyra's my favorite. It was the musical instrument of Orpheus, the greatest musician that ever lived.\nCasey : I have all his CDs. Kidding.\nMax : Do you know the story? So, Orpheus loved one thing more than music and that was Eurydice, the most beautiful girl that ever lived. But she died. She was poisoned. And Orpheus could not live without her. So he went down to Hades to bring her back. The ruler of Hades agreed, but there was a catch. If he turned back to look at her face she'd be gone forever. Just before he got to the surface he heard this rock crash behind him, so he turned back to see if she was all right. And that was it. The gates to the underworld slammed shut she was gone forever.\nCasey : That's terrible. What happened to him?\nMax : He... He spent the rest of his life wandering the Earth alone.\nCasey : Do you want to take a look?\nMax : No. I'm not turning back.

Scalped bodies lay on the ground, the sound of FLIES heavy in the air. Some of the bodies have been loaded into the back of a buckboard wagon by two men. The CHICAGO TRIBUNE REPORTER is documenting the scene with his camera. His flash-pan WHOOSHES loudly. The horse hitched to the buckboard is startled by the sound and WHINNIES. )\n( The reporter looks up from his camera towards the ridge to see a party of three men riding on horseback. One figure, on a white horse, rides ahead of the two other men. The two men with the reporter chamber rounds in their weapons. )\nReporter: It's Durant.\n( DURANT dismounts, as do the two men. )\nReporter: ( to himself ) What the hell's he doing here?\n( Durant walks up to the Reporter. )\nDurant: Are you the Chicago Tribune reporter?\nReporter: Yes\nDurant: Did you photograph this body?\nReporter: Y-yes, sir, Mr. Durant, but just-just the one body.\n( Durant looks at the man, disgusted. )\nDurant: What's wrong with you, man?\nReporter: I'm sorry. I thought...\nDurant: Just the one won't do.\n( The Reporter is confused. )\nDurant: ( to the men by the buckboard ) Get those bodies off the wagons. Come on, snap to, boys.\n( The men drag one man, the sentry who was shot first, from the wagon. They drag the sentry back to the field as Durant continues to talk to the reporter. )\nDurant: I want this scene photographed exactly how you found it. I want an unblinking look at the horror perpetrated here.\n( The Reporter is still confused. )\nDurant: More arrows. We need more arrows.\n( Durant gathers arrows and sticks them into random corpses lying in the meadow. He attempts to stick one into a man lying in front of the Reporter but it won't go in. Durant pushes it slowly in with a SQUISH, much to the Reporter's disgust. Durant looks up at him. )\nDurant: He can't feel anything. He's dead, for God's sake.\n( Durant turns as a man, identified as DURANT'S MAN, walks from the tree line. )\nDurant: The maps. You find them?\nDurant's man: ( shrugs ) No, sir. Nothing anywhere.\nDurant: Keep looking.\nDurant's other man (O.C.): Mr. Durant, over here!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ CUT TO: Woods ]\n( Durant and his men walk towards two bodies, one being Sun Bear, the brave killed by Lily Bell. Durant kneels and rolls over the other. It is Robert Bell. )\nDurant: Robert. ( stands ) Pack up everything. Bring it all back to Hell on Wheels.\n( Durant is about to leave when something catches his eye in the grass. He bends to pick up the object. It is a silver pocket watch. He opens the hunting case and turns it to see the inside of the cover. There is a black and white photo of Lily Bell stuck to the watch cover. He looks at the photo a long while. )\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ EXT. The Cut - Day ]\n( Men, both Negro and white, are working in the cut. BOHANNON walks along the top of the cut, monitoring work. He looks at ELAM before continuing on. Two men approach on horseback at a gallop. One, Dix, has long brown hair. The other, BOLAN, has short, sandy hair and a beard and wears a Union jacket. Bohannon notices them and puts his hand on the grip of his gun. Elam climbs out of the cut and stands next to Bohannon as Dix and Bolan approach. )\nElam: ( quietly ) They found Johnson's body. Everybody back in camp talk 'bout it.\n( Bohannon turns to Elam. )\nBohannon: Get the hell back in that cut.\n( Elam doesn't move. Bolan arrives first and pulls his horse to a stop. )\nBolan: You Cullen Bohannon?\n( Bohannon and Elam stare at Bolan. )\nBolan: You hear about Daniel Johnson's murder?\nBohannon: Who wants to know?\nBolan: ( raises eyebrows and smirks ) Why you so spooked, son?\nBohannon: I guess I still ain't cottoned to the sight of Union blue riding up on me.\n( Bolan chuckles and smiles. He turns to Dix, who gives a small smile. )\nBolan: You ought to be happy to see us.\nBohannon: Yeah? And why's that?\nBolan: Boss wants to talk to you about taking Johnson's job.\n( Bohannon sighs and looks at Elam )\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ EXT. Hell on Wheels - Same Day ]\n( Town is bustling with activity after the move to a new location. People are setting up their tents. MICKEY is pulling up a pole that forms part of the framework for the Magic Lantern Show tent. )\n( SEAN exits the Starlight Saloon with two bottles of liquor. He crosses the street to Mickey and hands him a bottle. )\nSean: Here you go, Mickey. ( puts his arm around Mickey's shoulder ) Yeah.\n( Near the rail line, Bohannon rides his horse, following Dix and Bolan. Bohannon is smoking a cigar. )\n( CLOSE ON man hanging from a makeshift gallows )\n( The trio arrive at their destination and dismount. Bohannon follows Bolan up the steps of a caboose. Bohannon removes his hat and puts out his cigar with his boot before entering. )\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ CUT TO: INT. Caboose ]\n( A large, imposing man dressed in a black waistcoat sits praying over a piece of hardtack at his desk. This is THOR GUNDERSEN. The hanged man can be seen through the window behind him. )\nSwede: We thank thee Lord for this bounty you have placed before me.\n( He finishes and looks up at Bohannon. He indicates a chair across from his desk. )\nSwede: Sit down.\n( Bolan pulls up a chair across from the Swede's desk. The Swede dips the hardtack in a bowl of liquid. )\nSwede: Sit down.\n( Bohannon doesn't sit but eyes the Swede. The Swede calmly takes a bite of hardtack. Bohannon looks out the window at the hanged man. )\nSwede: ( nods towards window ) Horse thief. Tor Gundersen, head of security for Mr. Thomas Durant.\n( The Swede extends his hand. Bohannon shakes. )\nSwede: They call me the Swede. ( beat ) I'm Norwegian but no matter. ( shrugs ) We are all Americans now, even you Rebels, yes?\n( He smiles but Bohannon does not return it or respond. )\nSwede: Hmm...Daniel Johnson told me that the two of you was cut from the same cloth.\nBohannon: ( scoffs ) Yeah? I don't think so.\nSwede: ( bits into hardtack ) Why is that? Did you not like him?\nBohannon: ( shrugs and shakes head ) He was my boss. That's about all there was to it.\nSwede: And drinking companion, yes?\nBohannon: ( nods ) We tore it up some.\nSwede: I understand the two of you was \"tearing it up some\" on the night he was murdered. In fact, you was seen leaving the saloon with him. Hmm?\n( The two men stare each other down for a moment. Bohannon smirks. )\nBohannon: Yeah. ( looks toward Bolan and Dix ) I'm not here to talk about Johnson's job, am I?\nSwede: ( laughing ) Is that what they told you?\n( Bolan and Dix stand near the door, chuckling. Bolan has placed himself in front of the door. The Swede continues to chew on the hardtack. )\nBohannon: You a lawman, Mr. Swede?\nSwede: Hmm?\nBohannon: 'Cause I don't see no badge.\nSwede: ( brushes off his clothes ) Oh, no. There's no official law out here yet.\nBohannon: Then what authority you got to be interrogating me?\nSwede: ( looks up ) Mr. Durant has appointed me to bring some order to the chaos out here.\nBohannon: When's the last time you took a look outside, Mr. Swede? ( beat ) Looks to me like chaos is winnin'.\nSwede: Well, when harlots and dipsomaniacs are killed, I lose not a minute's sleep. But Daniel Johnson was a valuable asset to Mr. Durant.\nBohannon: Daniel Johnson was hated by just about every man who worked for him.\nSwede: ( with interest ) Any with a reason to kill him? ( beat ) Perhaps one of the Negroes. ( nods ) I heard he had some trouble with them. Hmm?\nBohannon: I wouldn't know nothing about that.\nSwede: ( skeptical ) Hmm...Ja, ja.\n( He sweeps the crumbs from the hardtack with his pinky and he mutters in Norwegian. He looks up at Bohannon. )\nSwede: Well, that leaves only you then.\nBohannon: ( beat ) You know what? I'm done here. This ain't no court.\n( The Swede grips a double-barrel, pistol-grip coach gun that is holstered to the underside of his desk. Bohannon moves towards the door. As he passes, Dix pulls Bohannon back by his coat pocket. Bohannon unsheathes a knife and nicks Dix. He holds the knife to Bolan's throat. The unmistakable CLICKS of the hammers going back on the shotgun stops Bohannon in his tracks. )\n( The Swede holds up the gun, the word \"BEAUTY\" carved on the side of one barrel. )\nSwede: This here's Beauty.\n( Bolan swings Bohannon's knife away from his throat. He pulls out his pistol and cocks back the hammer. He straightens his jacket, indignant. )\nSwede: She's an old piece, but she still shoots true.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ CUT TO: INT.

He puts on manacles that are tethered around one of the floor boards. )\n( Bolan stands near the door, his pistol trained on Bohannon. )\nSwede: We gonna give you a chance to confess to this crime.\n( He nods and Bohannon looks up at him in fear. The Swede slowly turns away and leaves. Bolan holsters his pistol and slides the door shut. The CLANK of the chains can be heard as he locks Bohannon in. )\n( Bohannon waits a moment before pulling at the chain looped around the floor board. The board CREAKS but it doesn't budge.

What are you doing way out here?\n( Joseph takes the brush from the men. )\nJoseph: Where's the woman?\n( He holds out the brush to Pawnee Killer. It was Lily's once. )\nPawnee Killer: We don't have her. Yet.\nJoseph: You kill white men, that's one thing. But you take one of their women and you'll have every damn one of them hunting you down.\nPawnee Killer: ( nods ) Good. I'll count coup and get more scalps.\nJoseph: I hope it was worth it.\n( Joseph turns and starts to walk away. )\nPawnee Killer: What about the scalps you took?\n( Joseph stops and looks over his shoulder. )\nPawnee Killer: You act so pure now, but I remember a time when you loved the taste of blood.\n( Joseph turns more fully towards Pawnee Killer. )\nJoseph: ( nods ) Jesus has forgiven me for that.\nPawnee Killer: ( nods ) Jesus may have forgiven you but do you think your white friends would?\n( Joseph stays silent and walks away. )\nPawnee Killer: ( calling after Joseph ) You better find her before I do.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ INT/EXT.

He throws straw around the nail and quickly sits with his back to the wall. )\n( The door slides open. The camera pans up from a pair of black boots to reveal the Swede. He has removed his coat. A silver charm of Thor's hammer hangs from his pocket watch chain. He smiles as he surveys the pig car. He pulls a crate across the room and sits down. The crate CREAKS under his weight. The Swede looks at Bohannon for a moment before carefully beginning to eat. )\nSwede: I used to be a bookkeeper.\nBohannon: You look like a bookkeeper.\nSwede: Hmm. I was always more comfortable around numbers than people. I could control numbers.\nBohannon: The war put a stop to that, didn't it?\n( The Swede chews for a moment and looks at Bohannon. )\nBohannon: You're suffering from the Soldier's Heart, Mr. Swede. Yeah, I can see it in your eyes. You're still fighting them battles.\nSwede: I saw no battles. I was a quartermaster. More numbers. I never even saw the enemy 'til our supply train was captured and I become prisoner of war.\nBohannon: Andersonville?\nSwede: ( nods ) That's right. Way down in the great state of Georgia. Total chaos ruled. Thirty thousand prisoners, fourteen thousand dead. I weighed two hundred pounds when I went it, and eighty-six when I come out. I just couldn't make them numbers add up.\n( He pulls up left sleeve to reveal a large red scar )\nSwede: I awoke one night to find one of my own men trying to eat the flesh from my arm. He thought I was dead. But I realized that night I had to control people like I control numbers and I learned to practice a sort of immoral mathematics. And I did some... ( whispers ) horrible...not so good things in Andersonville, Mr. Bohannon. Ja? In the end, I found I was able to make them numbers add up.\n( He finishes eating and rests spoon against bowl rim. )\nSwede: ( brighter ) So, have you thought about that confession?\nBohannon: I figured by your math you're gonna hang me either way.\nSwede: Ja.\n( The Swede slowly rises and turns to go. )\nBohannon: You know why the man didn't finish eating your sorry ass?\n( The Swede turns around and steps closer to Bohannon. )\nSwede: Hmm?\nBohannon: 'Cause you Yankees all taste like sh1t.\n( Bohannon suddenly kicks out and knocks the bowl and spoon from the Swede's hands. The Swede shouts in anger. Bohannon prepares himself for retribution but the Swede gets hold of himself. )\nSwede: ( calmly ) Get right with your Maker, Mr. Bohannon. Soon as we cut down the horse thief, you gonna hang.\n( The Swede exits and shuts and locks the door. He stares down Bohannon between the slats of the car before leaving. Bohannon waits a moment before he moves towards the spoon and bowl the Swede left behind. They are beyond the reach of his hands. He kicks the bowl away and drags the spoon towards him with his foot. The spoon gets caught between two floorboards. He strains but can't get it free. He scissors it between his feet and lifts it from the crevice. Grabbing it from his feet, he quickly brushes away the straw from the nail. Using the spoon as a lever, he starts pry it up. He chuckles to himself as it pulls slowly from the wood. He holds the nail in his hands, looking at it. )\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ INT. Pig Car - Same Day ]\n( The Swede cuts down the horse thief from the gallows with the help of Dix.

His beautiful wife, Lily, the Fair-Haired Maiden of the West, was sullied by the savage pack, then carried off into slavery in their filthy camp.\nReporter: What does sullied mean again?\nDurant: It will mean whatever the reader wants it to mean. My road will bring civilization to these untamed western lands. And the Fair-Haired Maiden of the West represents nothing less than civilization itself.\nReporter: You see this as sort of rallying cry?\nDurant: Yes, now you're getting it.\nReporter: Save her at all costs.\nDurant: Save her, yes but I want national troops brought in to clear every last savage from the path of my road.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ EXT.

Crouching, she peers over the log and sees the campfire abandoned. She stumbles up to the ashes of the campfire and kneels beside them. It is still smoldering. )\n( Lily unbuttons her dress and examines the wound in her left shoulder. It is still bloody and very deep. She pulls at the boning in her corset. She struggles but pulls a piece free. She breaks it into a smaller piece and bites down on the end. She tugs at the hem of her skirt until she comes away with a long strand of thread. )\n( Lily wraps the thread around the makeshift needle she had made from the boning. She takes a moment, breathing deeply and looking at the sky, preparing herself for what she must do. She pushes the needle through the skin around her wound. She cries out, biting down on the bandage on her hand to stifle the sound. She makes several passes of the needle before she is done. She closes her eyes, her lashes wet with tears and falls backwards onto the grass, unconscious from the pain. )\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ EXT.

And he was freed by an angel.\n( Bohannon looks Cole up and down before wresting the chains back from the Reverend. His look is skiddish. )\nBohannon: I ain't no Saint Peter, sir.\nCole: Yeah, and I'm no angel.\n( Bohannon moves to the tent flap and peers out. )\n( The Swede is just outside but he hasn't seen Bohannon. )\n( Bohannon closes the flap.

Better than you know. But it won't be good enough for him. So all you got to do ( gets on his knees ) is get down on your knees.\nBohannon: I seen plenty of men get down on their knees and call His name out in terrible time. I seen their prayers answered by a bullet, more often than not.\nCole: It's-it's hard to comprehend, son, I know and it's impossible sometimes. But He is here and His mercy knows no bounds. So, just bend them knees and ask for forgiveness.\nBohannon: Nah, sir.

Ain't no secret you got to lay forty miles of usable track before your government money kicks in. Now, you and I both know that you ain't going to get there going at this rate.

It is the cross-stitch his wife had been working on in the flashback, though it has faded some. He runs his fingers over the stitches before bringing it to his nose and sniffing it. He closes his eyes. )\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Ginger is shouting.\nPam: Ginger, enough.\nEric: Thank you.\nBefore Longshadow could bite Sookie, Bill kills him. Ginger screams and vomit.\nEric: Humans. Honestly, Bill, I don't know what you see in them.\nCredit\nScene 2: In the toilets of Fangtasia - Sookie\nSookie cleans up.\nScene 3: Fangtasia - Pam, Ginger, Eric, Bill\nGinger is cleaning the floor.\nGinger: How did I end up with you people? Jesus. Mother Mary in heaven. I'm so sorry, Mama. I'm so sorry.\nEric: When Ginger is finished, glamour her for me.\nPam: Are you sure? She's been glamoured one too many times already. Who knows how much of her is left.\nEric: It's either that or turn her. You want her?\nPam: Please, I'm not that desperate. Glamour it is.\nEric: Excellent. (To Bill) Come. I'll buy you a Blood.\nScene 4: Fangtasia, in Eric's office - Eric, Bill\nEric gives a bottle of True Blood to Bill.\nBill: Thank you.\nEric: How do you stomach that stuff? Don't you find it metallic and vile?\nBill: I don't think about it. It's sustenance, that's all. (Eric laughs) What?\nEric: If you're their poster boy, the mainstreaming movement is in very deep trouble. Tru Blood. It keeps you alive, but it will bore you to death.\nBill: Let's cut to the chase, shall we?\nEric: You killed a vampire, Bill. For a human. What are we gonna do about this?\nBill: What do you have un mind?\nEric: I'll take the girl.\nBill: No. You can have anyone. Why do you want her?\nEric: Why do you want her? You're not in live with her, are you?\nBill: Sookie must be protected.\nEric: That sounds like an edict. But it couldn't be, because I would know about that. Admit it. You love her.\nBill: If I hadn't done what I did, would you have let his disloyalty stand?\nEric: Whatever I did to Longshadow, I would not have done in front of witnesses. Especially not vampire witnesses. Not smart, Bill. Not smart at all.\nScene 5: In Jason's truck - Jason, Amy, Eddie\nJason: All I'm saying is, Lafayette didn't have to kidnap him. And I'm pretty sure he left with some V.\nAmy: Hey. If you wanna make the same arrangement with Eddie Lafayette's done, have at it. This is just the only thing I could think of to get you blowing your first vampire.\nJason: You done this before, haven't you?\nAmy: Done what?\nJason: This. Kidnapping vampires. Jesus. I should have known something wasn't right the second you walked into my life carrying that big bag of crazy. Any woman with a purse that big's bound to have something in it I don't wanna know about.\nAmy: Jason. Baby, you're sweet, but you've gotta mellow out.\nShe turns the radio on.\nJason: The f*ck is this hippie music?\nAmy: Shh.\nScene 6: In the toilet of Fangtasia - Sookie, Pam, Ginger\nSookie continues to clean up. Pam arrives and gives her clothes.\nPam: Put these on.\nSookie: Oh, thank you, but I'm fine, really. I'm just gonna dry out my hair and be on my way.\nPam: You're not going anywhere. Eric and your boyfriend aren't nearly done talking just yet.\nSookie: Os Bill in some kind of trouble?\nPam: That's for the boys to figure out. Right now, what you need to do is change out of your clothes. There's vampire in your cleavage.\nSookie: Okay.\nPam: Allow me.\nPam removes the peace of vampire of Sookie's cleavage.\nSookie: Thank you.\nPam: I'm beginning to understand the fuss everyone's making over you.\nGinger enters.\nGinger: Oh, hey there, Pam. Oh, who's your new friend?\nPam: Ginger, Sookie. Sookie, Ginger.\nGinger: Nice to meet you, Sookie.\nSookie: Right. Nice to meet you too.\nGinger: Oh, you don't have to be so scared. They're really very nice here.\nScene 7: At Jason's basement - Jason, Amy, Eddie\nJason: You got him?\nAmy: Yeah. Tape the windows shut. Here. Clear this out. We gotta clear all this sh1t out.\nJason: Lift his legs.\nAmy: Ready?\nJason: How's this gonna go?\nAmy: Tie his arm there. (She finds an oxygen masque) What?\nJason: I guess I got a little paranoid after 9/11.\nAmy: No, because after New York and D.C., terrorists were gonna come to Bon Temps.\nJason: And I said I was paranoid.\nAmy: Get his feet.\nEddie: What are you gonna do to me?\nJason: Yeah, I was kind of wondering that myself.\nAmy: We're gonna drink from him.\nJason: And then what?\nEddie: Yeah?\nJason (to Eddie): Dude, I got this. (To Amy) What's the plan?\nAmy: Jason, can you please try to live in the now with me.\nJason angry: I do live on the now. In fact, I've gone entire months without thinking about sh1t. But the truth is, right now, the now kind of sucks. And if we both can't admit that, then we are 100 percent f******.\nAmy takes some blood from Eddie.\nAmy (showing the blood she took): Who wants the first taste?\nJason: I ain't doing it. Not like this.\nEddie (whispering): Thank you.\nJason: I said, stop talking to me.\nAmy: Come with me, baby. Don't let your fear get in your way.\nJason: Look, it ain't fear, all right? It's just... (low so that Eddie can't listen) He's looking me right in the eye. It ain't right. Look at him.\nAmy: Fine. I'll see you when I get back.\nJason stops her before she can swallow some blood.\nJason: Wait, wait, wait. Ain't you supposed to cut it with aspirin?\nAmy: No, there's no risk of clotting when the V's this fresh.\nShe swallows the blood that is in the plug.\nAmy: My God.\nJason: You look... really happy.\nAmy: Come on, baby. Come with me.\nShe gives him the plug.\nEddie (to Jason): Don't. Don't do it.\nJason: I said, don't talk to me.\nHe takes the plug and drinks the rest of the blood.\nScene 8: At Miss Jeanette - Miss Jeanette, Tara\nTara: What exactly did you do to my mama?\nMiss Jeanette: You were here. You saw it.\nTara: Yeah, but I wanna know exactly how and why it worked. Cause I'm already taking a monster leap of faith even considering this demon crap.\nMiss Jeanette: Fine, then. It's like this. Your mind, your body... it's just a physical manifestation of your soul. And your soul is sick.\nTara: My soul don't wanna get ripped off.\nMiss Jeanette: How's your mama doing?\nTara: She's doing great. But she believes in sh1t like this. I don't.\nMiss Jeanette: If you don't believe, then why did you come all the way here tonight?\nTara: How much it'll cost me?\nMiss Jeanette: Seven-ninety-nine, ninety-five.\nTara (shocked): What?\nMiss Jeanette: Seven-ninety-nine, ninety-five. Cup of rum's on the house.\nTara: Well, my mama paid less than half that.\nMiss Jeanette: What I do takes varying amounts of energy and involves varying amounts of risk. Now, what you got inside you is much more powerful than what your mama had. Much more dangerous too.\nTara: I'm worse than her? I once found that woman on the ground, eating her own vomit because she didn't wanna waste the alcohol she lost bringing it all up.\nMiss Jeanette: Think about it. But not for too long. You can't afford to keep pushing people away. Your loneliness is spreading to your eyes. It's becoming a part of who you are.\nTara: You're one hell of a saleswoman, aren't you?\nMiss Jeanette: Next time you're alone, stand in the mirror and count backwards from 10. If you can get all the way down to zero, then I'm wrong. But if you can't stand your own company for 10 seconds, how you gonna expect to do it for the rest of your life?\nScene 9: In front of Sookie's house - Bill, Sookie\nSookie and Bill are walking from his car to Sookie's house.\nSookie: So you're not in any trouble?\nBill: A simple slap on the wrist, that's all.\nSookie: You swear? Pam made it sound like...\nBill (interrupting her): Pam was turned almost a hundred years ago and yet somehow still behaves as though every day were Halloween. She's all drama and theatrics. I assure you, everything's gonna be fine.\nThey enter Sookie's house.\nSookie: I'm gonna take a shower. I still feel like there's blood all over me.\nShe turns on the light and sees blood on the wall.\nBill: Don't look up.\nTina is on the ventilator, dead.\nSookie (shouting): Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nScene 10: At Jason's - Jason, Amy, Eddie\nJason and Amy are naked, kissing, under V.\nAmy: Wait, wait, wait. First, we have to thank the vampire for the gifts that he's bestowed upon us. (To Eddie) We are grateful...\nEddie: F*** you.\nAmy: ... for your gift to us. (To Jason) Ignore him.\nJason and Amy imagine their selves in a beautiful forest. They are swimming in the air, naked.\nAmy: Can you see it?\nJason: Where are we?\nAmy: Nowhere. Everywhere. Together.\nEddie look at them, and is crying blood.\nScene 10: At Sookie's - Bill, Sookie\nThey are on Sookie's bed.\nBill: Aren't you tired?\nSookie: Every time I close my eyes, I see her face.\nBill: Your cat?\nSookie: Gran. But now that you mention it, Tina's in there too.\nBill: You do know that I'm not gonna let anything happen to you? That I am here for you to protect you.\nSookie: And what if I don't wanna need to be protected? What if wanting to be protected makes me feel like the helpless little girls I used to be all over again?\nBill: Sookie. All of the things that you need to be protected from, all of the trouble you're in, you're in because of me. So you needing to be protected has nothing to de with you or who you are. All of it is my fault. So why don't you just go to sleep and let me be the one to worry about it?\nSookie: Bill, all the trouble I'm in, it's mine. I chose it. I chose it when I chose you.\nBill: Yes, but...\nSookie: Don't you think I wanna blame somebody else? But what I did to my Gran and now to poor Tina, it's my fault. And it's sweet of you to try to take it on for me, but if I let you, I'd be so mad at you, I'd never be able to look at you again. And right now your face is just about the only thing getting me by. So why don't you just leave it on me, okay?\nBill: Very well.\nHe kisses her.\nSookie: Night, Bill.\nBill: Night, Sookie.\nShe closes her eyes and sees her Gran on the kitchen's ground, dead in her blood. She opens her eyes suddenly.\nScene 11: At Jason's garden - Amy, Jason, Eddie\nAmy is in the garden, and someone is watching her.\nSomeone: You're a f*cking dead woman.\nAmy (screaming, fainting to be scared): Oh, my God!\nJason jumps and laughs.\nAmy (smiling): Honestly, you are like a little boy.\nJason: Did I scare you?\nHe takes off the oxygen mask and put it on his head,\nJason (smiling): Yeah\nAmy: Come here, lie down. I wanna show you something.\nHe lies down near her on a cover, near her,\nJason: What are we looking at?\nAmy: The trees. But we're not just looking, we're listening too.\nJason: Listening to the trees?\nAmy: Can you hear that?\nJason: It's like the leaves are talking!\nAmy: They're laughing.\nJason: Yeah, because they're ticklish.\nAmy: That's right.\nJason: Amy?\nAmy: Yeah, baby.\nJason: We still high?\nAmy: No, baby.\nJason: Because I don't normally talk like this. Plus, I'm feeling kind of lightheaded too.\nAmy: You're talking like this because your mind is starting to open up. And you're lightheaded because you haven't eaten anything. So here. (She sits and gives him to eat) Have an almond, they're raw.\nHe eats the almond.\nJason: Oh, my God. These crazy good.\nAmy: We gotta change the way you eat. Raw foods. Nothing processed. Because the cleaner the body, the cleaner the soul, the cleaner the experience.\nJason: Cleaner than last night?\nAmy: Much cleaner.\nThey kiss.\nEddie (shouting from the house): Amy!\nAmy: He'll stop. He'll stop.\nEddie (shouting): Jason!\nJason stops kissing Amy.\nJason: Ain't you worried somebody's gonna hear him?\nAmy: You live in the middle of nowhere of the middle of nowhere.\nJason: Yeah, I guess but...\nAmy (interrupting him): He isn't a person, Jason.\nJason: Did I say he was? All I'm saying is... My truck, for example. It ain't a person either. But I still fill it with gas and give it oil from time to time.\nAmy: You're saying we should feed him now?\nJason: Ain't he gonna die if we don't?\nAmy: Who cares?\nJason: I just... I still think we should have a plan, that's all.\nAmy: I do have one.\nJason: Oh, yeah?\nAmy: And here it is. Everything's gonna work out, because it has to.\nJason: That ain't a plan.\nAmy: Because when I'm with you, what I feel... I've never felt that with anybody else ever before. And I'm a person that a lot of bad stuff has happened to in the past and so I deserve this. I love you. (Jason doesn't answer and drinks) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I mean, why is it we all need to be loved but then when somebody finally says, \"I love you\", people just run scared. I love you, Jason Stackhouse, whether you like it or not. I'm not afraid to admit it.\nJason: Know what? You're right. F**** it. I love you too.\nThey kiss.\nAmy: Say it again.\nJason: I love...\nAmy: Come on.\nJason: You get it once, that's all.\nScene 12: At Tara's house - Tara, Letti Mae, Sam\nTara is in her bathroom, in front of the mirror.\nTara: Ten, nine, eight, s...\nLetti Mae comes in.\nTara (shouting): Don't you knock? What if I was doing something private?\nLetti Mae: I taught you that was a sin against God. If I walk in on you doing it, it's your problem.\nTara: What do you want?\nLetti Mae: Sam Merlotte's here to see you. You ain't sleeping with him?\nTara get out of the bathroom and goes in the entrance, her mother follows her.\nTara: What makes you jump to that conclusion?\nLetti Mae: He brung flowers. Men only bring flowers if they already slept with you and looking again. That especially goes for white men, as black men are less prone to grovel.\nTara opens the door.\nTara: What do you want, Sam?\nSam: To apologize for what I said that hurt your feelings and sort things out between you and me.\nLetti Mae: That's a load. It's s*x he wants.\nTara: Mama.\nTara goes out.\nSam: She drinking again?\nTara: No. That's her, stone-cold sober. Look, you should go.\nSam: Why?\nTara: Because I'm just too f*****-up for this.\nSam: You're not even the most f*****-up person in this house, much less this town.\nTara: What do you think this is between us? We were clear from the beginning it was just gonna be us f******.\nSam: It's too late for that.\nTara: What are you, a masochist?\nSam: No, not at all. But I've spent my life running away from people or pinning my hopes on somebody I can't have. I'm done with that. Like it or not, you've reminded me that I'm a social animal. I'd rather deal with your f*****-up sh1t than be alone.\nTara: Here's some f*****-up sh1t for you. Do you know that right now I have myself thinking I have a demon inside me? The only way to get it out is have some lady who lives in a bus in a swamp perform 800$ exorcism on me that there's no way in hell I can afford?\nSam: Waw.\nTara: Yeah. So go ahead. Now tell me you still want something more with me.\nSam: Not if it's gonna be like this. But I'd like it if we could...\nTara: Well, we can't, all right? Look, just go, okay? Get out of here and save us both a lot of misery.\nSam: All right, I'll see you at work.\nShe goes back home and he throws the flowers on the ground.\nScene 13: At Merlotte's - Amy, Arlene, Sam\nAmy is looking at Arlene's ring.\nAmy: Oh, my God, it's beautiful.\nArlene: I know, right?\nAmy: So you guys having an engagement party or what?\nThey are at the bar now.\nArlene (loud enough so that Sam could hear them): We'd like to, but I don't know where we'd throw it. You know, our place isn't big enough.\nSam: You could have it here, if you like.\nArlene: Oh, thanks. But I wouldn't wanna put you out.\nSam: You wouldn't be. It'd be like any night, except I'd close the place to the public for you and your dearest.\nArlene: Oh, wow, Sam, that would be amazing. Except I was thinking could we do it in the warehouse next door? Or even outside? Because if we did it in here, it'd feel like work, you know?\nSam: You were thinking, huh? About the party I only just now offered to throw for you?\nArlene: You are a spectacular man, Sam Merlotte.\nSam: And you are one hell of a conniving suck-up when you need to be. I'll cover the catering and the band. The alcohol and all the other incidentals are on you and Rene.\nArlene: Got it. And I may be conniving but I still mean it. You are gonna make some woman extremely happy one day.\nSam: Maybe someday I'll meet a woman willing to take that chance with me.\nSookie arrives, furious.\nSam: Morning, Sookie.\nSookie: Ain't nothing good about this morning.\nScene 14: On the road, at Jason's job - Jason, Lafayette, Rene, Hoyt\nJason is eating on his truck, listening to the trees.\nHoyt and Lafayette are on another truck, eating.\nLafayette: \"Secret Sauce\"? Who you f****** kidding? Since when is it right to call mayonnaise a f****** secret?\nHoyt: I don't know. I kind of like it, though.\nLafayette: You can like it all you want to. It's still mayonnaise.\nJason (shouting to Rene): What are you thinking?\nRene: Thinking f*cking roots should learn where to grow.\nJason removes his helmet.\nJason: What?\nRene begins to dig the root with the chain saw.\nJason: What? Rene. What? (He jumps from his truck and run to stop Rene) Hey! Hey! Rene!\nJason make Rene fall.\nRene (shouting): The f***, man?\nHoyt and Lafayette run to them.\nHoyt (shouting): Shut it down.\nRene: Get the f*** off me.\nLafayette pushes back Jason.\nLafayette (to Jason): What the f*** is wrong with you? You got a screw to loose?\nRene (shouting): You could've killed me.\nJason: I'm sorry, I know, but it ain't just some root growing out of nowhere. It's connected to that tree. Everything we see, man, it's all connected.\nRene: The f*** you talking about? You some kind of treehugger now? You gonna kill your buddy to save a tree?\nLafayette (to Rene): Chill, son.\nRene (shouting): I could give a f*** if you're sorry. I'm about to get married. There are people that count on me.\nLafayette (to Rene): Okay, come on, let's get you cleaned up.\nRene and Lafayette go.\nJason: S***.\nHoyt: Hey. Is everything all right, J?\nJason: t, were you on the football team?\nHoyt: No.\nJason (taking him by the shirt): Were you on the football team?\nHoyt: No, I wasn't.\nJason put him down.\nJason (shouting): Then you do not call me J. you got that?\nHoyt pushes him.\nHoyt: Yeah. Yeah. I'm... Yeah, I'm sorry.\nHoyt goes.\nJason: Goddamn it. Goddamn it.\nScene 15: At Merlotte's - Andy, Sookie, Amy\nSookie: What can I get for you today?\nAndy: Your boss around?\nSookie: Tell him you're looking for him. What can I get you?\nAndy: Don't know, I haven't decided yet.\nSookie sit in front of him.\nSookie: Then while you make up your mind how about I tell you what you can get for me? I would love whoever's killing off my family's head on a platter. Think you could arrange that for me?\nAndy: I don't appreciate your tone, Miss Stackhouse.\nSookie: I don't appreciate officers of the law enjoying casual lunches while there's a killer trying to hunt me. Did you know he got into my house again last night?\nAndy: He did?\nSookie: Yes, and he killed my cat. Cut her head off and took it with him.\nAndy: Jesus. How come you didn't call the station?\nSookie: All the station would've done is send you. You'd still be here acting as though you don't know what you're gonna order even though you always wind up having the cheeseburger.\nAmy: Hey there, detective Bellefleur, I'll take you order.\nSookie: No, it's my table.\nAmy: I got it. Just take a break. It'll do you some good.\nSookie leaves.\nAmy: What can I get for you?\nAndy: Go with the goddamn cheeseburger and fries.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene 16: Outside the Merlotte's - Amy, Sookie\nSookie is on a bench when Amy joins her.\nAmy: Hey, you. Listen, you all right?\nSookie: Sometimes I wish I smoked, you know? So you could sneak outside without anybody knowing something's wrong with you.\nAmy: Okay. I'm really sorry about your cat.\nSookie: Maybe I shouldn't have come in today.\nAmy: Yeah, I was gonna say, why did you?\nSookie: I don't know. Maybe because lately it seems like if I called in sick every time somebody I loved got murdered I'd never make it in for a day of work.\nAmy: Don't you think Sam would understand?\nSookie: I guess. But if I went home, what would you do?\nAmy: Me? What's it got to do with me?\nAmy seats near Sookie.\nSookie: With Arlene doing nothing but showing off her ring you'd be the only one waiting tables.\nAmy: Yeah, she is gonna be a handful, that one.\nSookie: Can you imagine what she was like the first time she got married? What about you? You ever been married?\nAmy: Is this the part where the sister asks what the girl's intentions are with her brother?\nSookie: Because right now, I am all about protecting Jason.\nAmy: He misses you, Sookie.\nSookie: Right.\nAmy: No, he does. I mean, between your grandma passing and then what happened afterwards with you...\nSookie: He told you about that?\nAmy: He couldn't not. I mean, he's a mess about it.\nSookie: Well, you wouldn't know it.\nAmy: Look, I know what you must think of him. And I get why you're mad at him, I do. But he loves you. You still got people around you who love you. And all I can hope is that maybe one day, I can be counted in among those people.\nSookie: You are way too good for him. You know that, right?\nAmy: Of course I know that. I'm not stupid.\nScene 17: At Jason's - Jason, Eddie\nJason arrives home and turns on the tv.\nTv Reverend Whitley: You can call me all the names you want, but I am confident in my position that when the day comes I meet my Maker, it is I would be allowed to pass through the gates into the glory of eternity.\nTv animator: Thank you, reverend Whitley. Miss Flanagan, would you like to turn the conversation back to the Vampire Rights Amendment?\nJason: Shut up, shut up.\nTV Nan Flanagan: After the massacre of three of our kind in Louisiana this week, I think the world should take notice of the fact that we have not retaliated. And we will not. Which leaves us with the question of exactly who is hunting whom out there in America tonight?\nTV animator: I applaud your rhetoric. That was very impressive.\nEddie shouts form the basement.\nJason (to Eddie): sh1t the f*** up!\nTV Reverend Whitley: But I warn my fellow citizens that her message is false.\nJason goes sown in the basement.\nEddie: Thank you. Thank you. Please, I...\nJason (shouting): What is it?\nEddie: I need you to move me. Too much pain. This chair, it's digging into my skin.\nJason: Thought y'all couldn't feel pain.\nEddie: When you don't drink your body... Your whole body aches more than anything I ever felt when I was alive. Please?\nJason: Well, if I move you, will you shut up?\nEddie: I promise.\nJason: This better not be a trick.\nEddie: It's not.\nJason: And don't you f****** bite me.\nEddie: I don't event have the energy. Just, please?\nJason begins to move him.\nJason: Jesus. For a vampire, you sure are a doughy f***.\nEddie: I'm sorry. Aaaaah.\nJason: There. That any better?\nEddie: I think so, yeah.\nJason: Yeah, good, because now I'm all f*****-up.\nScene 18: Merlotte's - Tara, Sam\nTara enters and takes her clothes and sees an envelope full of money.\nTara: What the hell?\nSam is at the bar. Tara arrives.\nTara: I found an envelope full of cash in my cubby.\nSam: Yeah?\nTara: You know anything about it?\nSam: We'll talk after work.\nTara: Sam, you know I can't...\nSam: I said, after work, all right? Anyone needs me, I'll be in my office.\nScene 19: At Bill's house - Bill, Eric, Pam, Chow\nBill plays golf at the wii.\nWii voice: Yes, he's done it again. Another lovely shot. A hole in one.\nThe doorbell rings. Bill turns off the wii and goes to open the door. It's Eric, Pam and Chow.\nBill: Eric. Pam.\nEric: Bill, Chow. Chow, Bill.\nThey enter.\nChow (to Bill): Nice to meet you\nPam: Chow is Longshadoow's replacement.\nBill: I take it by your being here, there was no way around it, then?\nEric: I can't really say. Didn't exactly look into it.\nBill (to Pam): Tell me, do you enjoy living halfway up his backside the way you do?\nPam: Yes, it's nice. You should try it.\nBill (to Eric): We're gonna have to stop by the bar where Sookie works first. She needs to know that I'll be gone. Don't forget how this started. She came to Fangtasia to help you.\nEric: Fine. Go to the bar.\nPam: Might be smart to check out the competition.\nEric: Yes, indeed.\nChow (to Bill): What's your game?\nBill: Excuse me?\nChow: You were playing Wii. What's your game?\nBill: Golf.\nChow: What's your best score on Pebble Beach?\nBill: Seven under.\nChow: Mine's 11 under.\nBill (to Eric): I liked Longshadow better.\nScene 20: At Jason's basement - Jason, Eddie\nEddie: It still hurts?\nJason (doing stretching): No, that went right away. I guess that's a perk of me doing V. But this... this stretching just feels so goddamn f****** good.\nEddie: Another perk.\nJason: Yeah. What's with the weight, dude? I thought all you vampires were supposed to be in shape.\nEddie: We are what we were when we turned. I led a very sedentary life.\nJason: What's sedentary?\nEddie: Desk job. I was an accountant. Sat around a lot, ate a lot of junk food.\nJason: Well, how's someone go from being an accountant to being a vampire?\nEddie: It wasn't the straightest of lines. I always had this sense that it wasn't really my life I was leading. But I convinced myself it was the life I wanted. Then one day, about a year ago, I came home from work to find my wife crying like her whole family had just died. Turns out my son had had a fist fight at school. So one of the kids suggested to him that I might be a \"f****** faggot\".\nJason: Well, kids are m******.\nEddie: That's precisely the reaction my wife wanted me to have. And when I didn't...\nJason (putting his shoes): What, she never even had a clue?\nEddie: How could she, when even I didn't?\nJason: I'm sorry.\nEddie: Don't be. Comes a point is life when you realize everything you know about yourself, it's all just conditioning. It's the rare man who truly knows who he is. At least accomplished that.\nJason: I guess it helps that you don't look all that gay. Most of the gays I've come across they look like...\nEddie: You. You're what we're supposed to look like. Anyway, after she left me and took my kid I went to a gay bar, hit on a couple of men. Got laughed at. Or pitied. Then I saw this one guy. He was even less of a looker than me and he had beautiful young men all over him. Somebody told me he was a vampire. And I guess I just thought: \"Well, that's for me.\" After that, it was just a matter of time before I found someone willing to turn me.\nJason: That's crazy.\nEddie: I told you it wasn't the straightest of lines.\nJason: So how did it work out for you? With the guys and everything?\nEddie: Well... you tell me.\nScene 21: At Merlotte's - Sookie, client, Bill, Eric, Pam, Chow, Tara, Amy\nSookie (taking an order): Okay.\nBill enters the bar.\nClient: I'll have that on the side too.\nSookie: Okay, coming right up.\nSookie: Bill, what's going on?\nEric: This place is even more depressing than I thought it'd be.\nSookie (to Bill): What are they doing here?\nBill: Give me a minute, then we'll talk. Where's Sam?\nSookie: I don't know. Why?\nTara: He's in his office.\nBill (to Eric): Try to behave yourself.\nEric: Don't I always?\nScene 22: In Sam's office.\nSam is in his office when Bill knocks at the door.\nSam: Yeah?\nBill: Bill Compton. I need a minute of your time, if that's all right.\nSam: It's open.\nBill and Chow enter.\nSam: Who's this?\nBill: His name's Chow.\nSam: He need to be in my office too?\nBill: Yes. I have very little time, so I'll be brief. I've been called away. And I need you to watch over Sookie, protect her when I'm gone.\nSam: Well, that's just priceless.\nBill: Don't expect her to be too keen on the idea. Sookie hates feeling like she doesn't have independence.\nSam: I'm really starting to get fed up with you telling me who Sookie is.\nBill: I know. And I also know how you feel about her, and I don't like it. But I'm asking you because you're the only one I can ask. You're the only person I know of who can protect her in my absence. Will you do it?\nSam: Of course I will. But I'll be doing it for her, not for you.\nBill: Thank you.\nBill and Chow leave.\nScene 23: At Merlotte's - Eric, Pam, Sookie, Bill\nBill (to everyone): So simply present this card at the door when you get to Fangtasia (Pam distribute the card) and the first round is on me.\nPam: Also, Thursdays are ladies nights, so be sure to bring a date. (To a client) That is, if you can get one.\nA friend of this client: She got you.\nA client: Thanks, ma'am.\nEric: Not him. He doesn't get one.\nClient: What gives, bro?\nEric comes near him.\nEric: What'd you do to your arm there... bro? (Bill comes. To Bill) I take it your business here is done?\nBill: I came to talk to Sookie.\nEric: I'll give you three minutes. We have a tribunal to get to.\nSookie: What?\nBill: Come with me.\nHe brings her outside.\nEric: Oh, before I go, a word of advice: We know when a human has wronged us. We can smell it. So do not make the mistake of letting the pretty vampire lady on television make you feel too comfortable. We may not have retaliated... yet... but we know who you are. Have a nice night.\nScene 24: Out of the Merlotte's - Sookie, Bill, Eric, Pam, Chow, Tara\nBill (to Sookie): I have no choice, I have to go.\nSookie: Why?\nBill: Because I killed a vampire.\nSookie: I know that, I was there, remember? He was gonna kill mw. You were defending me.\nBill: if one of you killed another one of you defending one of us, there would be a tribunal.\nSookie: I'll come with you then.\nBill: No.\nSookie: I can and I'm going to. I wanna testify for you.\nBill: Damn it, you can't. You can't come. And you can't testify. You will not be welcomed there.\nSookie: You lied to me. You said everything was gonna be okay but it's not, is it?\nBill: I honestly don't know.\nEric (a little far from them): Ticktock, Bill\nSookie: Bill...\nBill: Just look after yourself, all right? I've asked Sam to watch over you.\nSookie: Wish you hadn't have done that.\nBill: Be smart, Sookie, and just let him. There's still somebody out there who wants to kill you.\nSookie: Fine. I will.\nBill: Thank you.\nEric: And time.\nSookie and Bill kiss. Tara arrive and sees them from far.\nPam: If I had any feelings, I'd have the chills right about now.\nEric: Not me. (Loud) Bill. Now.\nThey stop kissing, and Bill goes to Eric. Sookie is crying. The vampires leave. Sookie goes to Tara.\nTara: You all right?\nSookie: No.\nTara: Look, I'm sorry about...\nSookie: Tara, right now I din't remember what it is I'm supposed to be mad at you for so why don't we just forget it, okay?\nTar: Hey, that's good to me.\nThey hug.\nScene 25: At Jason's basement - Jason, Eddie\nJason: It was in the flood.\nEddie: A flood? Oh, my.\nJason: Yep. It was the sh1ts. But you gotta play the hand you're dealt, I guess.\nEddie: And when you say you were living at your grandmother's I take it to mean your grandfather was already gone? I'm so sorry.\nJason: Why? It wasn't your fault.\nEddie: It's just that a boy needs a man in his life to teach him what it means to be a man.\nJason: Yeah, whatever.\nEddie: That's the hardest part of all this for me. My boy. He's got nothing but women around him now. He needs me. I'm not there.\nJason: Well, I'm sure he'll be all right. I mean, look at me, huh? Don't you glimmer me. Amy warned me about that.\nEddie: I'm too depleted to glamour you. That's something I haven't quite mastered yet, anyway.\nJason: Really? You can't just do it?\nEddie: Learning to be a vampire doesn't happen overnight any more than learning to be a man does. You gonna marry her?\nJason: Who, Amy? I don't know. We haven't been together that long. But... just between you and me? I could really see her being the one.\nEddie: She's not.\nJason: What?\nEddie: Don't do it. Don't marry her.\nJason\" None of your business.\nEddie: She's a psychopath.\nJason: Hey, f*** you, Eddie.\nEddie: She is. She is fat more dangerous than I could ever be.\nJason (shouting): That's enough. (Calmer) Look, I gotta go out and get some more beer. But while I'm gone, keep your f****** howling to a minimum.\nJason leaves.\nScene 26: At Merlotte's - Sam Tara\nTara: Can we talk about it now?\nSam: Sure. (She gives him the envelope) That's not talking about it.\nThey go in Sam's office.\nTara: I can't take it, Sam. I appreciate it, I do. But...\nSam: You're keeping it.\nTara: You can't tell me I'm keeping it.\nSam: It's my money, so, yes, I can.\nTara: You're a stubborn son of a b****.\nSam: Well, that makes two of us. You really believe you have a demon in you?\nTara: I think I got something inside me that is scared and pissed off and mean and\nSam and Tara: F*****-up.\nTara: Think it's stupid, don't you?\nSam: Look, two years ago nobody even knew there was such a thing as vampires. Now we gotta deal with them every goddamn day. And who knows what else is out there?\nTara: 800 bucks? That's a lot of money, Sam.\nSam: Yeah, well people in this town drink a lot. Well I'm doing okay.\nShe takes back the envelope.\nTara: So I guess I'm having an exorcism.\nSam: You're welcome.\nTara: Oh, Sam. I don't know how to ever thank...\nHe kisses her.\nScene 27: At Merlotte's - Lafayette, Sookie, Amy, Sam, Tara\nLafayette is cooking in the kitchen when Sookie comes in.\nLafayette: Interesting night, huh, Sook?\nSookie: Yeah, I guess. Maybe a little too interesting.\nLafayette: S***, ain't no such a thing as too interesting, only too dull.\nSookie leaves.\nLafayette (to John): So, John, how big is your d***?\nSookie sees Tara and Sam kissing in Sam's office. She goes back in the kitchen.\nSookie: You know what? There is such a thing as too interesting.\nSookie goes at the bar.\nSookie (to Amy): Where's Arlene?\nAmy: Well, she just left.\nSookie: Of course she did. I have to get out of here. Would you mind covering the rest of my side work for me?\nAmy: Sure, but is that really the best idea, you going home by yourself?\nSookie: I'm not. I'm going to stay at Bill's. No one'll come looking for me there.\nAmy: Okay, then.\nSookie: Thanks, I owe you one.\nSookie leaves.\nAmy: No worries.\nSookie leaves on her car. Sam goes to the bar.\nSam: Oh, hey, Amy.\nAmy: Hey.\nSam: Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for everything you've been doing. You're fitting in great around here. Really.\nAmy: Well. I should be the one thanking you. Lord knows I needed this job. But you are welcome.\nSam: So where are the others?\nAmy: Arlene had to get back to her kids and Sookie took off a couple of minutes ago.\nSam: What?\nAmy: Yeah, I tried to stop her, but...\nSam: She say where she was headed?\nAmy: She was going to Bill's.\nAmy: Goddamn it, Sook.\nSam leaves, running.\nScene 28: Outside the Merlotte's - Sam, Andy\nSam is running to his car.\nAndy: Hey there, Sam. Turns out that story you told me the other day about growing up in a nudist colony didn't exactly check out. We need to talk.\nSam: Sure, just... You know, I forgot something in the bar, but I'll be right back. Okay?\nHe goes back inside. The dog of Merlotte's passes in front of Andy.\nAndy: Hey, dog. Well, screw you too.\nScene 29: At Bill's - Sookie, the dog\nSookie arrives at Bill's. She sees the dog in front of her.\nSookie: Oh, my God. Didn't anyone ever tell you not to sneak up on people like that? What are you doing so far away from home? Why don't you come spend the night with me and I'll take you back to Merlotte's tomorrow, okay? Come on. It's night-night time.\nThey enter Bill's house.\nSookie: Come on. Come on.\nThey are in Bill's room.\nSookie: You know, if we're gonna be sleeping together we're gonna need a name to call you by. What do you think of \"Dean\"? Yeah, I like it too. Dean. Dean the dog. Look at you, looking away. What a gentleman. Here, would it make you more comfortable if I got under the covers?\nShe goes under the covers.\nSookie: Come on. Hop up in the bed with me. You can't sleep on the floor all night. You're gonna catch a draft. Now, hop up here. (The dog goes on the bed.) Good boy, Dean. Sweet dreams.\nShe turns off the lights and sleeps.\nScene 29: At Jason's - Jason, Eddie\nJason arrives home. He goes down to the basement with Tru Blood bottles.\nJason: Eddie? Eddie, wake up. Wake up. Here.\nEddie: You brought me Tru Blood?\nJason gives him to drink.\nJason: Just drink.\nScene 30: At Bill's - Sookie, Sam\nSookie: Dean, you're on my feet.

We don't want to block their trucks.\n(Warrick sees the body on the garbage bags, a newspaper covering the man's face.)\nWarrick: Whoa, what we got here? Hey, guy! Hey!\n(Warrick moves the newspaper and sees the man's eyes clouded white.)\nWarrick: We've got a male DB.\nCatherine: Call it in. You got it, Mitch?\nOfficer Mitchell: I'll tape the scene.\n(Catherine and Warrick leave Officer Mitchell with the dead body and they continue their way to their crime scene.)\n[EXT.

The guests next door complained about the noise, manager finally called the point. Unis found this.\n(Catherine looks around.)\nCatherine: I don't see any luggage. Wedding rings still on the fingers. Probably rules out robbery, but not infidelity. One gets to watch the other one die?\n(Quick flashback to: The man and the woman are both alive.

You want misdemeanors, too?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. CSI - LAYOUT ROOM -- DAY]\n(Wendy goes over her findings on the shirt with Warrick. The shirt and photos of the shirt are spread out on the table.)\nWendy: So the blood on the shirt belongs to your victims. The high velocity spatter on the front is a mixture of both and the blood drops on the left sleeve appear to solely belong to the woman.\nWarrick: Probably cast-off from the beating.\nWendy: Now, the pattern on the sleeve has a straight line on the outside, and then a matching band of spatter on the inside. So the killer rolled up his sleeves?\nWarrick: He had a lot of work to do.\nWendy: Speaking of which -- the wet spot. (She looks at the results.) The s*x stain was a male-female combo, both unknown, but the female shared alleles at all loci with both of the victims. It's their daughter.\nWarrick: The parents weren't that old. The girl would be a teenager at most. So the killer caps Mom and Dad, rapes the girl, and takes her with him.\n(Catherine walks into the room with print information.)\nCatherine: If you've got a missing kid, I've got a pedophile.\n(Warrick looks at the information.)\nWarrick: Alistair Rhodes. Busted in August '94 for child molestation.\nWendy: That's pre-CODIS, so there's no DNA on file to match.\nWarrick: Alistair Rhodes. I remember this guy. He was a lounge singer, called himself \"Three Miles of Bad.\" It was all over the news.\nCatherine: Well, according to the sheet, he served five years and made parole. A registered s*x offender. We know where he lives.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[EXT. CHURCH - FRONT STEPS -- DAY]\n(Rev. Alistair Rhodes talks with two kids sitting on the front steps. He offers them a bag of burgers.

Alistair Rhodes is quiet.)\nBrass: You know them, don't you?\nAlistair Rhodes: There's nothing I can tell you.\nBrass: These people have a daughter, and she's missing. And due to the fact that you're a convicted s*x offender, that means that you better come up with a lot more than these corny priestly homilies and you better come up with them fast.\nAlistair Rhodes: I don't answer to you. I want to talk to my lawyer.\nBrass: That's a good idea because you're under arrest.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT.

Me, I like to think I'm broadening my horizons.\nWarrick: Yeah, along with your pay grade.\nArchie: Oh, happy coincidence indeed, sir. What you got here?\n(Warrick gives Archie the motel registration form.)\nArchie: Wow. Somebody needs to switch to decaf.\nWarrick: In there somewhere is a Nevada plate number and a name. Can you dig it out?\nArchie: I could try.\n(Archie puts the motel registration form on the scanner.)\nWarrick: The plate number is \"something, something, something, D, seven, something, something.\"\n(Archie runs the plate number, * * * D 7 * *.)\nArchie: Okay, well, it's a fairly new model. The four letter, three number configuration has only been standard a couple years.\n(The computer beeps with 54,756 results.)\nWarrick: Ooh.\nArchie: Well, uh ... it's a start.\nWarrick: Well, can yoy cross-reference these records against the characters in the vic's last name. It's \"M, A, blank, blank, blank, I, blank, blank.\"\n(Archie runs another search with, \"M A * * * I * *.\")\n(The computer beeps.)\nWarrick: Now that's a good start.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[EXT.

He turns to check the kitchen.)\n(Warrick continues through the living room. There are clothes on the chair and a white Bible on the side table.\n(Nick sees a pot is on the lit gas stove. He turns the stove off.)\n(Nick also finds something fleshy and red on the counter.)\nNick: Oh, man. What the hell is that?\nWarrick: That looks like balut. It's this Filipino delicacy. My grandmother's best friend is from Manila.\nNick: Bet it tastes like chicken.\nWarrick: The Macalinos must've been in quite a hurry to leave their dinner out like that.\n(Warrick and Nick start down the hallway. Nick checks the little girl's room. He finds the little girl in bed, a trickle of blood coming from her head.

Greg opens the drawer and finds a Wi-Fi card inside. He picks it up.)\nGreg: Wi-Fi card but no laptop.\n(Grissom notes the family photo on the dresser.)\nGrissom: Mom, dad ... and two girls.\nGreg: They have another daughter?\n(Grissom listens and in the silence he hears muffled buzzing. He looks up. Greg also noted the sounds.)\nGreg: Okay, so it's not just the ringing in my ears.\n(They walk over to the ceiling hatch to the attic. Grissom motions with his head that Greg should open it.)\n(Greg pulls the ceiling hatch open and a ladder slides out. Grissom and Greg exchange looks. They both look up at the attic door.)\n[INT.

A bee buzzes across his face. He looks over at the source of the buzzing sounds and sees a bag and box covering the opening.)\n(He nudges a bee walking on the cooler bag. The bee flies away. Greg is snapping photos. Grissom moves the cooler bag away and looks at the hole in the wall.)\nGrissom: Greg? Do you have any allergies?\nGreg: No. Why?\nGrissom: Give me a hand.\n(He moves the box away to expose the hole, then removes the insulation blocking the hole.

POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT]\n(Brass questions Alistair Rhodes while his lawyer sits next to him.)\nBrass: The Macalinos had two daughters-- Amy and Elizabeth. Elizabeth is dead, and Amy is missing.\nLawyer: That is tragic, but it has nothing to do with my client.\nBrass: Your fingerprints were found at the motel where the Macalinos were murdered.\nLawyer: My client has already explained that.\nBrass: You know, back before you were saving souls, when you were just molesting children, you had a partner ...\nLawyer: Who died in prison eight years ago.\nBrass: We found male DNA on the bedsheets at the Rancho Center Motel. You got yourself a new partner, just like old times.\n(Quick flashback to: [MOTEL] Alistair Rhodes holds Amy down on the bed while his partner unbuckles and unzips his pants. End of flashback.)\nBrass: Only, this time, the parents busted in on you. That was bad for you, but worse for them. And now that mom and dad are never going to come home, you get yourself a whole new playpen to party in and a new buddy to party with.\nLawyer: The DNA at the motel -- was it my client's?\nBrass: No.\nLawyer: Then why is he still in custody?\n(Brass sits down.)\nBrass: Because he's still lying. You're not an ordained minister. You're not a part of any recognized church. You got nothing to hide behind. So avoid the death penalty -- give us your partner, we get the girl, and you get ... redemption.\nLawyer: Six years ago, I was an alcoholic and a crackhead. This man pulled me out of the gutter and saved my life. My firm is doing this pro bono. I guarantee he will not do another day in jail.\nAlistair Rhodes: My partner ... is the Lord.\nBrass: Well, I'm sure it's not His DNA on those sheets.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT.

Warrick checks the closet. Nick opens the flip-down ironing board. Warrick checks the shirts in the closet.)\nWarrick: Hey, Nick. For a guy with his own flip-down ironing board, these shirts look pretty wrinkled.\n(Nick checks the flip-down ironing board space, banging on the wooden walls. He checks the board and finds there's a hole under the cover. He cuts the cover open and finds digital videotapes inside. The tapes are numbered.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT.

(He holds the bag to his forehead and jokes.) All right, let me guess. Star Wars bootlegs.\nWarrick: Child pornography.\n(Archie quits joking.)\nWarrick: Start with the latest first.\nArchie: Yeah.\n(Archie opens the bag and sits down. He pop tape IV in the machine and hits play and rewind. The tape plays as it rewinds. The view is UPSIDE DOWN as if someone dropped the camera on the floor. The camera turns UPRIGHT and they see two men fighting as a woman is tied to the bed.)\nWarrick: That's enough. Let it play.\n(They play the tape.)\n(The young woman tied to the bed screams as Reverend Alistair Rhodes shouts to her.)\nAlistair Rhodes: (from tape) ... bang you with chains of iron!

POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]\n(Brass is back interviewing Alistair Rhodes with his lawyer present.)\nAlistair Rhodes: I've helped other people cast out the Devil before.\nBrass: Videos one through five. LAWYER: I advised the reverend to document his rituals for situations just like this. He performed a religious service with the full consent of the parents and then he left the motel room.\nBrass: Look, if you think we're going to fall for that, you have a lot more faith than I thought.\n(Grissom is in the room watching the interview.)\nLawyer: He has no knowledge of the deaths or of Amy Macalino's current whereabouts.\nBrass: Counselor, is this your idea of cooperation?\nAlistair Rhodes: L-listen to me. Listen to me. The mother came to me ... at her wit's end, heart in her hand, begging me, begging me to free her child. She said she'd tried doctors and pills, but nothing worked, so I went to the house, I saw it with my own eyes.\nINSERT: FLASHBACK\n(Alistair Rhodes climbs up the ladder to the attic.

It wasn't human. I had to cast it out.\nGrissom: Did it work?\n(Grissom walks over and sits at the table across from Rhodes.)\nGrissom: The exorcism-- did it work?\nAlistair Rhodes: No. Amy's father broke the rules: never speak to it, never interrupt, and believe me completely, do only as I say.\nGrissom: And he didn't believe.\nAlistair Rhodes: Mr. Grissom, do you believe in a separate, living evil?\nGrissom: You're primitive man on the savannah. You see something move out of the corner of your eye. You assume it's a hyena. You run, you live. If you assume it's the wind and you're wrong, you die. We have the genes of the ones who ran. We're genetically hardwired to believe living forces that we cannot see.\nAlistair Rhodes: The Devil's slyest trick is making us believe he isn't real. But call his name loud and long enough ... (He knocks on the table.) ... guess who comes knocking on your door?\nBrass: Usually guys like you. Look, enough with the Sunday school bull. This meeting is over, the deal is off.\nLawyer: We've answered your questions.\nAlistair Rhodes: I told you the truth. You have to let me leave.\nLawyer: He's right about that.

He passes Ronnie on her way in.)\nRobbins: Hi, Ronnie.\nRonnie Lake: Hi. (to Sara) I faxed the DB's photo to various indigent organizations. Shelter on Rancho and Main ID'd him as a regular. Their special this week was socks and sandwiches. Rancho and Main is less than a mile from where we found him. Bum got into a fight -- business as usual -- and died of exposure, right? Oops, that was a question. I know, I'm down to four, but, I mean, that's it -- case closed, right?\nSara: What does that look like to you?\nRonnie Lake: Perimortem abrasions ... parallel, double rails. It's handcuffs. Cops must have picked him up before he died.\nSara: Maybe that's not all they did.\nRonnie Lake: Well, that's a guess.\nSara: What is the first thing that the police do when they question a suspect?\nRonnie Lake: Check for ID. Standard procedure.\nSara: Eddie Kaye's only identification was an expired driver's license found separated from all of his worldly possessions.\n(Sara picks up the bagged license and sighs as she looks at it.)\nSara: Print it.\nRonnie Lake: Well, you're not seriously going to go after the cops over something like this?\nSara: You know what? That question I will answer. We're not here to protect anyone, Ronnie, not even the cops. We're here to figure out what happened.

So I cuff him up, I check his ID. I'm ready to run him in, but my partner says to drop it.\n(He checks his ID.)\nEND FLASHBACK.\nOfficer Casella: He says this is an old bum trick, right, like take a swing at a cop, you go to jail where they have AC, they have food, they have water.

I need it to study Colony Collapse Disorder. Bees are dying in record numbers everywhere.\nSara: You know, I did read that if every bee on earth died, the human race would follow four years later.\nGrissom: There's no hard evidence to support that, though.\nSara: Oh.\nGrissom: But the world will end ... someday.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[EXT.

        "prompt_0": "Barney's Office\nTed from 2030: Kids, as you know, I was designing Goliath National Bank's new headquarters on the site of this old hotel, The Arcadian. Problem was, some people didn't want The Arcadian torn down. Even bigger problem, they were led by my girlfriend Zoey.\n(Outside, Zoey and her supporters are protesting)\nCrowd: G-N-B is the e-ne-my!\nZoey: (She sees Ted at the window) Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on! Hey, sweetie! Are we still on for dinner at 8:00 at Valenzisi's? That's great! I can't wait!\nCrowd: That's great. I can't wait! That's great. I can't wait!\nTed from 2030: But somehow, Zoey and I were making it work.\nAt the Bar\nBarney: Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.\nRobin: Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face? (chuckles) She wants it.\nLily: Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of something like this?\nTed: Of course you feel that way, Lily. You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve.\nLily: You guys are in screaming matches all the time.\nTed: Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Growing matches.\nTed from 2030: It was true. Zoey and I loved to challenge each other.\n[FLASHBACKS]\n(Ted and Zoey are watching the TV)\nTed: The main character is a young spoiled prince thrust into leadership after the death of his father. It's obviously a modern-day retelling of Henry IV!\nZoey:Are you kidding me?! It's Don Quixote...the classic quest story with the hero-jester and his long-suffering manservant!\nTed: Okay, clearly, when we're watching Tommy Boy, we're watching two different movies.\n(Later, Ted is on the phone with Zoey)\nTed: No, you hang up.\nZoey: No, you hang up.\nTed: No, you hang up.\nZoey: No, you hang up.\nTed: No, you hang up! (Later) No, you hang up.\nZoey: No, you hang up.\nTed: No, you... (His phone starts beeping) Hold on. (beep) Hello?\nRobin: For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone?\nTed: Why would you do that?!\nZoey:I-I thought you'd like it.\nTed: Who likes that? Zoey:I like it.\nLily: Your relationship sounds exhausting.\nTed: Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.\nLily: Marshall and I have been together 15 years, and the only debate we've had about Tommy Boy is whether it's awesome or super awesome. That's love, bitch.\n[OPENING CREDITS]\nTed from 2030: Now around this time, Marshall had truly come to hate his job. He hated the paperwork. He hated the coffee. He hated the dirty jokes. He hated everything.\nAt the Bar\nMarshall: I have to quit.\nBarney: Quit GNB?! Why?\nMarshall: I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...\nBarney: Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.\nLily: Baby, you have my full support.\nBarney: Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning. (Barney snickers) Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.\nRobin:I don't think you know what Spain is.\nBarney: Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.\nTed: It's dinero.\nBarney: Where? I want his autograph!\nTed from 2030: So Marshall walked in the next morning all ready to quit. But then something weird happened. Suddenly, he didn't hate the paperwork. He didn't hate the coffee. He didn't even hate the dirty jokes. Out of nowhere, Marshall actually liked GNB.\nRobin: It's graduation goggles.\nMarshall: What? Robin:Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated.\nLily: The guy who was basically a dog? Robin:He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. (as speaking to a dog): He was a good boy.\nBarney: Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having s*x with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it. Robin:The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer.\nMarshall: You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.\nBarney: No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!\nLily: Baby, more than ever, you have my full support. (Lily and Marshall kisses)\nZoey and Ted are in bed, in Ted's appartment / Lily and Marshall are in bed in their appartment / Barney is in bed with a girl in his appartment\nTed: You know, sometimes I feel bad for Lily and Marshall.\nLily: I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.\nBarney: It starts with an... \"L?\"\nGirl: How can you not remember my name?\nTed: It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time.\nZoey: Well, they don't do that all the time.\nTed:Yes, they do.\nZoey: No, they don't. Ted:Yes, they do. It's like they... Lily and Marshall:... don't see eye-to-eye on anything! Totally.\nGirl: It rhymes with your name.\nBarney: And I said my name was...?\nAt Lily and MArshall's appartment\n(Marshall comes in)\nMarshall: Baby, I did it! I quit. And then I walked right over to the NRDC, and I took that job.\nLily: Oh, good for you, sweetie.\nMarshall: Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right?\nLily: Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving?\nIn Barney's office\n(Barney is burning a photo of Marshall; Ted enters)\nTed: Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play \"Who's Hot and Who's Scott?\"\nBarney: It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything.\nTed: Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined.\n(A man enters)\nMan: Guys, everything's ruined.\nTed: What? Why?\nMan: Your girlfriend somehow got the Landmark Preservation Committee to agree to a hearing. If they declare the Arcadian a landmark, the whole project is dead. The good news is, I just got the phone number of a husky-voiced hottie in a turtleneck.\n(The man leaves the room)\nAt the Bar\nRobin:...so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious.\nTed: I'm furiously enjoying being challenged.\nLily: Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little murder-suicidey?\nTed: Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is killing you?\nLily: It's not.\nTed: Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, \"What about my trip to Spain, deadbeat?\"\nLily: Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, \"Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?\"\nTed: We take turns! Sometimes.\n(Marshall comes in)\nMarshall: Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.\n(Barney starts laughing)\nBarney: I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.\nRobin: Hershel?\nBarney: What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws.\nLily: Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker.\nBarney: There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?\nMarshall: Barney, I'm not playing...\nBarney: Just come back to GNB already!\nMarshall: I'm really loving my new job.\nLily: Oh, and I'm loving seeing you this happy.\nMarshall: I'm so glad to hear you say that because I volunteered our apartment for a big NRDC fund-raiser tomorrow night. You're-You're cool with that, right?\nLily: Baby, you have my full support.\nMarshall: Thanks, baby. (phone chirps) Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper.\n(Marshall leaves)\nBarney: That's how I'm gonna use mine.\nRobin: Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?\nBarney: Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.\nRobin:Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?\nBarney: Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. \"Barney, we have to talk about your father.\" \"Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil.\" \"Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session \"between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute.\" I don't need this!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAt Ted's appartment\n(Lily arrives)\nTed: Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One: your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her...\nLily: Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right? (Ted says something in spanish) Perfect. Let's go.\nAt Barney's office\n(Barney is on the phone with Marshall)\nBarney: Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?\nMarshall: Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.\nBarney: Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.\nRobin: (Robin is standing at the door) Oh, my God!\nBarney: How long have you been there?\nRobin: You don't remember?\n[FLASHBACK]\nRobin: Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.\nBarney: Oh, no, I'm fine.\nRobin: Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?\nBarney:Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?\nRobin: Yeah.\n(Barney makes a call to Marshall)\n[END OF FLASHBACK]\nBarney:Right. So, um... Chinese?\nIn Ted's car\nTed: You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple.\nLily: You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry.\nTed: Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.\nLily: But I thought you liked being challenged.\nTed: Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?!\nLily: Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12?\nTed: You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. There he is. Here we go. (Ted says some incomprehensible things in spanish)\nMan: I'm sorry. I don't speak... whatever it is you're speaking.\nTed: Um, he speaks perfect English.\nLily: Yeah, I-I know.\nTed: Then why did you ask me to come?\nLily: So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho.\nTed: W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?\nLily: You were right. If I hear myself say \"Baby, you have my full support\" one more time, I swear I'm gonna murder someone!\nTed: What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back?\nLily: I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time bomb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode!\nTed: Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Lily, I get it.\nLily: Marshall's been asking a lot lately.\nTed: But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.\nLily: I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids.\nTed: Lil...\nLily: Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this. (Lily leaves)\nMan: My bag? Oh, no. I got it.\nAt the Bar\nBarney: There's nothing to talk about.\nRobin: You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.\nBarney: I don't want to talk about it, okay?\nRobin: Why not?\nBarney: Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.\nRobin: I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... (quietly): ticking.\nBarney: That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?\nRobin: No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.\nBarney: Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.\nRobin: Huh?\nBarney: It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.\n[FLASHBACK]\nBarney: Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.\nMarshall: Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.\n(Marshall and his co-workers start chuckling)\nBarney: I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...\n[END OF FLASHBACK]\nBarney:...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted. (quiet sobbing) You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?\nRobin: What is wrong with you?\nAt Marshall's appartment\nMarshall: Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming.\nProf. Rodriguez: Oh, my pleasure. I have to use the restroom. Do you have some extra invitations?\nMarshall: Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up.\nTed: Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um...\nMarshall: What?\nTed: Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily...(sighs) Lily...\n(Lily arrives)\nLily: Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry.\nMarshall: Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil?\nLily: Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something.\nMarshall: No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think?\nLily: Baby, you have my full support.\n(Marshall and Lily kiss;Ted notices Zoey at the other end of the room)\nZoey: Ted.\nTed: Hey! What are you doing here?\nZoey: This is really important to Marshall, so I came to show my support.\nTed: This you can be supportive of?!\nZoey: What is that supposed to mean?\nTed: I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to kill that dream? My girlfriend!\nZoey: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about my lifelong dream of not seeing every beautiful building in Manhattan bulldozed?\nTed from 2030: And in that moment, I realized, though I really cared about Zoey, I couldn't do this for the next 50 years. I had to break up with her. But then... Kids, some couples always support each other, and some couples always challenge each other, but is one really better than the other? Yes. Support is better. Way better. But I'd have to learn that the hard way.\n[Ten years later; at Barney's]\n(Barney is in bed, looking very sick, Robin, Ted, MArshall and Lily are here)\nLily: You're too young. This isn't fair.\nMarshall: We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.\nBarney, weakly: Thank you, Marshall. (coughs weakly) Marshall... can I ask one final favor, my friend?\nMarshall: Yes, of course, of course... anything.\nBarney: Eat this meatball sub.\nMarshall: Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...\nBarney: I don't have much time!\nMarshall: Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?\n(The sandwich explodes, throwing marina sauce all over Marshall; Barney leave his bed)\nBarney, with a mean laugh: I'm not sick, you idiots! I've racked up $30,000 of uninsured medical bills for symptoms I don't even have. Totally worth it! You should see the look on your face. Oh, wait, you can't-- 'cause it's covered in marinara sauce!\nTed: Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas.\n(Barney looks at his pajamas and stops laughing; his face decomposes itself)\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Emma answers.)\nMr. Gold: Ready to go, Miss Swan?\nEmma: Almost.\n(Mr. Gold enters the apartment, and Henry enters the room with a suitcase and his coat.)\nHenry: Do you think we'll be cold where we're going, or warm?\nEmma: I think layers are always a good idea.\nMr. Gold: I thought the terms of our agreement were quite clear. You owe me a favour - you alone.\nEmma: I'm not leaving Henry here with Cora lurking about, so either we both go, or we both stay.\nMr. Gold: Then, we'll have to purchase another plane ticket, won't we?\n(Mary Margaret enters and helps Henry put on his jacket.)\nEmma: Wait. We're flying?\nMr. Gold: Don't worry, I'm covering expenses. Even the new ones.\n(David overhears the conversation as he comes down the stairs.)\nDavid: You're a real gentleman, aren't you? Alright, Gold, you're going out there with my family. Just know, if anything happens to them...\nMr. Gold: Then you'll what? Cross the town line? And David Nolan will hunt me down in his animal rescue van?\nDavid: I'll be devastated. This isn't a threat. It's a request. Take care of them.\nMr. Gold: I promise no harm will come to your family. After all, we have a deal.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Mr. Gold, equipped with the shawl around his neck, is driving. Emma is in the passenger seat, and Henry is in the back seat. They are heading down a deserted road in Mr. Gold's car.)\nHenry: So... Where are we going?\nMr. Gold: Logan International Airport.\nEmma: I think he meant after that.\nMr. Gold: Let's just take things one step at a time, shall we?\nEmma: You really think that shawl's going to work?\nMr. Gold: Well, if it doesn't, and I revert to my cursed self, we're all going to have some problems. It'll work.\n(They pass the 'leaving Storybrooke' sign and a wave of magic passes over Mr. Gold. There is a brief pause.)\nEmma: So?\nMr. Gold: My name is Rumpelstiltskin. And we're going find my son.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(At Mary Margaret's apartment, Mary Margaret is in the kitchen when David enters wearing two gun holsters.)\nMMB: You like the holster, huh?\nDavid: I miss carrying a sword.\nMMB: Well, it looks good on you.\nDavid: Come on. Leroy has the dwarves on Cora watch. They've got eyes everywhere, but they could use our help.\nMMB: Really? How hard can it be to find a powerful sorceress in a small town?\n(They go to leave. When they open the door, they find Regina, who was just preparing to knock.)\nDavid: Apparently, not very hard.\nMMB: Regina. You're back.\nRegina: I know you think I'm responsible for poor Dr. Hopper's death.\nDavid: He's... Alive.\nRegina: What?\nMMB: You were framed.\nRegina: Who would do that?\nMMB: Your mother. She's here.\nRegina: But... But that's... That's... Not possible.\nMMB: When we found a way back, so did she. We were wrong... And we're so sorry.\nRegina: I know. But, if Cora's here, then we're all in danger. Please, you have to let me see my son. I can protect him.\nMMB: He's not here.\nRegina: What?\nDavid: Mr. Gold asked Emma to help him find his son. They left town about an hour ago with Henry.\nRegina: And no one told me?\nMMB: We didn't know where you were. And, to be honest, Regina, I don't think Emma has to run anything by you.\nRegina: No, I suppose she doesn't.\n(Regina exits.)\nMMB: That went well.\nDavid: With her, it doesn't get much better. Come on. Let's go find Cora.\nMMB: Where?\nDavid: No idea. But I know who to ask.\n(David hands a quiver of arrows and a bow to Mary Margaret, and the two of them leave.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(David, Mary Margaret, Leroy, and Hook are at the docks. Hook walks with an obvious limp.)\nHook: You didn't even ask me about my recovery.\nMMB: How are you feeling, Hook?\nHook: Come closer and feel for yourself.\n(David hits Hook.)\nDavid: You want to lose the other hand? Where's the ship? Come on. Archie told us. It's shielded somehow, isn't it, mate?\nHook: Aye... That it is. Follow me. I don't know what you expect to find. Cora won't be there.\nDavid: Well, maybe she left something behind that will tell us where she went. Let's go.\nLeroy: No funny business. I'm watching you, pirate.\nHook: Yes, Dwarf. That should deter me from any maleficence.\nMMB: Oh, don't worry, Leroy. He'll help us.\nHook: What makes you so sure?\nMMB: Because you're a pirate. You know which way the wind blows, and, right now, it is gusting towards us.\nHook: Oh. I see where your daughter got her gumption. Follow me.\n(They arrive at the pier where the ship is anchored. Hook walks up the invisible stairs and disappears behind the shield. The rest of them follow suit.)\nLeroy: You sailed this ship from our land. Can you sail it back?\nHook: My ship? She's a marvel. Made from enchanted wood. We weathered many a storm together, seen many strange, glittering shores. But, to travel between lands, she must go through a portal.\nDavid: Yeah. What do you know about Cora's plans?\nHook: Cora's not the most communicative of lasses. I will tell you this - whatever malice she has in mind, her weapon of choice is in here.\n(Hook gestures to a tarp covered box. Leroy and David pull back the tarp, revealing a cage. Inside, is the shrunken giant from the beanstalk. He is unconscious/sleeping.)\nMMB: Who's that?\n-[Fairy Tale Land - Past]-\n(At the giant's castle, the giants have gathered for dinner. One of them rings a bell to summon Anton. Anton enters.)\nArlo: Ah. You're late, Tiny.\nAbraham: Missed you out in the fields, Tiny.\nAnton: It's Anton.\nAbraham: But you're just so damn tiny, Tiny.\nArlo: Alright, enough squabbling. Now, today, we celebrate. After a century of hard labour, the time of the bean harvest has finally arrived.\n(The giants, save Anton, pound their fists into the table and cheer.)\nAnton: ...Yay.\nArlo: But is a blossom more than its root? Is a harvest more important than a hard day's work? No. Each has value. Just as each of us has value. Hear, hear.\nGroup: Hear, hear.\n(The giants stand up to toast, but are interrupted by a loud bang. They look over at Anton. A human-sized harp has slipped from his sleeve onto the table.)\nArlo: You've been spending time in the treasure room again, haven't you?\nAnton: No. Maybe. So say that I was. So what?\nArlo: Your fascination with the humans and their artifacts is misguided. No good can come of it.\nAnton: How can you say that, when you've never even been to their world? And you won't even let any of us go down there.\nArlo: Have you forgotten what the humans did? Why we no longer trade beans with them? They weren't content merely traveling between the realms. They had to conquer and pillage.\nAnton: Because a few humans did some bad stuff, doesn't make them all evil.\nArlo: They don't abide by the same laws that we do, Anton. We giants foster life. They destroy it. That is why they must never know that we still exist, or that we still grow the beans.\nAnton: But why do we keep growing them... If nobody ever uses them?\n(There is an awkward silence at the table.)\nArlo: It's what we do.\nAnton: We don't do anything with them!\nArlo: It is the labour that makes us who we are. Not the fruit that it yields.\nAbraham: What is this? A human toy?\n(Abraham picks up the harp and inspects it.)\nAnton: Put it down.\n(He crushes the harp in his hand and drops it to the floor.)\nAbraham: Not much fun, is it?\nArlo: Abraham, that is enough.\n(Anton gets up from the table and runs out of the room. Arlo calls after him.)\nArlo: Tiny!\n(Anton exits the castle until he comes to the beanstalk. He looks down and ponders. He then decides to climb down to earth.)\n-[Storybrooke]-\n(David and company are still on Hook's ship. They are gathered around Anton's cage.)\nLeroy: So, Cora used magic to make him travel-sized.\nHook: Whatever she intends to do with him, it's important.\nDavid: Oh, I think you know exactly what she intends. You're holding out.\nHook: Well, either have your lovely wife torture it out of me, which I promise will be fun for both-\n(David grabs Hook by the throat and shoves him against the wall.)\nDavid: Why don't you and I have some fun?\nHook: I don't know what she's planning. Why don't you wake the bloody giant and ask him yourself?\n(Hook extends the key to the cage. Mary Margaret takes it and unlocks the door. She crouches down and touches Anton on the shoulder. He startles awake.)\nMMB: Hey... It's alright. You're safe now.\n(Anton crawls out of the cage.)\nMMB: What's your name?\nAnton: Anton. Where's that witch?\nMMB: She's gone.\nAnton: What did she do? She made me small.\nDavid: Come on. Let's get you out of here.\nAnton: You.\nDavid: Me?\nAnton: You!\n(Anton punches David in the face, causing him to fly backwards.)\nMMB: David!\nLeroy: Hey! Hey, over here, you big-\n(Leroy attempts to distract Anton, but is thrown down the stairs of the ship. Anton lunges at David, who has drawn his gun. He easily hits it out of his hand. Suddenly, Mary Margaret shoots an arrow past Anton's head.)\nMMB: Step away from my husband.\nAnton: You may have me outnumbered, but this isn't over. You think I forgot what you did? I didn't. You'll pay for your evil. I promise! You'll pay!\n(Anton flees the ship.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Belle is watching television in a common room at the hospital. Ruby enters with a basket of items.)\nRuby: Hey. You don't remember me, do you?\nBelle: Sorry, no, I... I don't.\nRuby: I'm Ruby. You used to come into my Granny's diner a lot. Before. I thought you could use some comforts from home. You were always telling me about Jules Verne, so I brought you my favorite - The Mysterious Island.\nBelle: Thank you. Were... Were we really friends?\nRuby: Yeah, we were.\nBelle: Then tell me the truth. Before I was brought here, I was hurt. I was bleeding, and then this man came. And he... He healed me. Then, I saw him hold a ball of fire in his hands. How... How is that possible?!\nRuby: The nurse said that the tranquilizers can give you wicked nightmares.\nBelle: No, I know what I saw. And I don't need any more tranquilizers or-\nRuby: Belle...\nBelle: Don't call me that. Why does everyone keep calling me that?\n(A nurse enters to restrain Belle.)\nBelle: I don't... I'm telling you, I don't...\nNurse: Take it easy. Take it easy.\n(The nurse sits her down in a chair and injects a sedative into her Belle's arm.)\nRuby: Has she been like this the whole time?\nNurse: More or less. We've had to keep her heavily sedated. Okay, let's get you back to bed.\nBelle: No...\nNurse: Here we go. There.\n(The nurse escorts Belle out of the room. Meanwhile, Greg has entered and has seen the outburst.)\nGreg: Everything okay in here?\nRuby: Everything's fine, Mr. Mendell. She's alright. How are you?\nGreg: Much improved.\nRuby: Well, then, rest up. The sooner you're better, the sooner you can be out of our quiet little town.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(David, Mary Margaret, and Leroy are sitting in a booth at Granny's Diner.)\nMMB: David... Did that giant just say he'll make you pay? For what?\nDavid: I have no idea. I've never seen that guy before.\nLeroy: Well, he sure knows you.\nDavid: No. It's not about me. He just thinks it is.\n-[Fairy Tale Land - Past]-\n(At his castle, James and barely-clothed Jack are having a make out session.)\nJames: You are a true wonder.\nJack: I know.\n(James picks her up and carries her to the bed. He drops her onto it, and the two of them resume where they left off. However, King George enters and interrupts.)\nKing George: I didn't know you had company, James.\nJames: Father. This is my father, the King. Father, this is-\nKing George: I don't care. The kingdom is teetering on bankruptcy. The name of your latest dalliance is of little concern to me.\nJack: Pleasure to meet you, too, Your Majesty.\nKing George: Good day.\nJames: Care for a drink, Father?\n(James goes over to a side table to pour himself a drink.)\nKing George: There'll be time for that later. Right now, there's trouble afoot. I just received word that there's a giant running amok in the outer village.\nJames: I thought giants were extinct.\nJack: I'd love the chance to battle one.\nKing George: No. No killing. Not yet, anyway. This giant could be of use to us.\nJames: Just tell me what needs to be done.\n-[Storybrooke]-\n(The trio is still at Granny's.)\nMMB: Your brother. That's who he thinks you are.\nDavid: It's the only thing that makes sense. Come on.\nMMB: Where are we going?\nDavid: To find out just what kind of trouble my brother got himself into. Leroy, get your head looked at and gather the dwarves. We need to keep an eye out for this giant.\n-[Fairy Tale Land - Past]-\n(Anton has successfully climbed down the beanstalk. He comes to a tavern, where he leans down and peers inside the window. Seeing as he can't fit, he gets up and turns to leave. However, James and Jack have noticed him and chase after him.)\nJames: If you want some ale, you should ask! They'll serve anyone who can pay, my friend. I'm James - Prince of this realm. I wanted to make sure you received a warm welcome.\nAnton: I'm Anton. I'm a giant.\nJames: Yeah, I can see that. What brings you to our land?\nAnton: I've always been fascinated with your customs. I just... Wanted to see it for myself.\nJames: Well, we would be more than happy to show you around. Of course, there's the matter of your size.\nAnton: I'm too small for back home, I'm too big for here.\nJack: Don't despair, Anton. I have something that may help you.\nAnton: What is it?\n(She pulls out a small piece of mushroom.)\nJack: Magic. A piece of mushroom from a far-off land. I once slayed a Jabberwock that was terrorizing a village, and they... They couldn't pay me in gold, so they paid me with this, instead. If you eat it, it will change your size. Its effects are temporary, but we have more.\n(Anton reaches down and Jack drops the mushroom piece into his hand.)\nJack: I'm pretty sure this one makes you smaller.\nAnton: Pretty sure?\nJack: Well, I haven't had the occasion to try it, but... The wise woman who gave it to me swore by its power.\nJames: Go on, Anton. Give it a try.\nAnton: I have no way to repay you for your kindness.\nJack: No need. If it makes you happy, that's all the payment that we desire.\nAnton: Well, then at least tell me your name.\nJack: Jacqueline. But... Most people call me Jack.\nAnton: Nice to meet you, Jack.\n-[Boston]-\n(Emma, Henry and Mr. Gold have arrived at the airport. They pick up their boarding passes from the desk, and then enter the line for security.)\nHenry: Have you ever been outside of Storybrooke before, Mr. Gold?\nMr. Gold: No.\nHenry: Are you nervous?\nMr. Gold: No.\nHenry: Are you worried about meeting your son?\nMr. Gold: No, Henry, I'm fine.\nEmma: How about we talk about all this later, kid? We're next.\n(Henry and Emma begin taking off their shoes to put in the boxes.)\nHenry: It must be really hard not to use magic - being like everyone else.\nEmma: You've got to put your shoes in.\nMr. Gold: How terribly uncivilized.\n(Mr. Gold takes off his shoes and Henry goes through the metal detector.)\nTSA Agent: Uh, scarf and the cane go in the basket.\nMr. Gold: What?\nTSA Agent: Scarf and cane go in the basket.\nMr. Gold: I can't.\nEmma: You have to.\n(The man behind them interrupts.)\nMan: It ain't rocket science, buddy. You ever been on a plane before?\nMr. Gold: Have you ever been impaled upon a cane before?\nEmma: My... Father's a little nervous. We're headed to a family reunion. Sorry.\nMr. Gold: Father?\nEmma: Just put your shawl in the bin. I'll help you get through.\nMr. Gold: If I let this go, I could forget who I am.\nEmma: I'm not going to let that happen.\nMr. Gold: Okay.\n(Mr. Gold takes the shawl off and puts it in the box with his cane. When he does, his hearing becomes distorted and he stumbles. He goes through the metal detector in almost a trace-like state, until Emma has a chance to grab his shawl out of the box on the other side of security. She puts it around his neck and his hearing and mind go back to normal. Mr. Gold gives a slight nod and the two of them begin to put their shoes back on. Henry is there waiting for them.)\nHenry: Guys, there's a Cinnabons here!\n-[Storybrooke]-\n(Hook enters a deserted alley near the docks. He places a card - the Queen of Hearts - onto the ground. When he turns around, Regina has appeared behind him.)\nRegina: Hello, Hook.\nHook: Regina.\nRegina: Expecting my mother? The one you were supposed to kill?\nHook: Oh, that. Well, I didn't want to deprive you of a happy reunion.\nRegina: Well, it's your lucky day. She and I have made amends.\nHook: And you're here to thank me? How sweet.\nRegina: She wants to know if they've found the ship.\nHook: Well, you can tell her, she can ask me herself.\nRegina: She decided it wouldn't be prudent for her to be out and about.\nHook: Well, then it is my lucky day. And you can tell her they found the ship.\nRegina: Well, did you get her things off it?\nHook: I've been tied up in bed - not in the good way.\nRegina: She needs her things.\nHook: Oh, I'll bet she does. Well, there's good news, then. A giant got loose from the hold.\nRegina: You lost a giant?\nHook: Well, a shrunken giant.\nRegina: How is that good news?\nHook: Because, when he got free, he took one look at the Prince, and became extremely murderous.\nRegina: Hm. A giant in town who wants to kill the Prince. This is just the distraction we need.\nHook: That it is, dear.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Elsewhere, Anton is attempting to navigate the streets of Storybrooke. He dodges cars as they honk at him.)\n-[Fairy Tale Land - Past]-\n(Anton, who is now small, James, and Jack enter the tavern. James pulls out a chair for Anton, and the three of them sit at a table.)\nJames: Much better to be on the inside, huh? Please. You're the guest of honour.\nAnton: No fighting for a seat at the table. If my brothers could see me now...\nJack: I'm not so sure about this family of yours, Anton. It doesn't sound like they appreciate you.\nAnton: They're not so bad. Except for the... Making fun of me. And the pushing me around. And the harsh words. Well, yeah, it's sort of bad.\nJames: Sometimes, you have to leave home to find the people you...truly belong with. Your real family.\nJack: It's like you were always meant to be here, Anton.\nJames: Now, make sure our Anton has all that he needs.\n(James gets up and heads to the other side of the pub. In the corner, a group of people are playing music. One of them is playing a harp.)\nAnton: I had one of those once. I never knew it made such beautiful music. My brothers are so wrong about humans.\n(Anton overhears James arguing with another man.)\nJames: It's unacceptable! Go back there and tell him what I said. Promise them anything. I don't care-\nAnton: Is there a problem?\nJack: He didn't tell you, did he? The royal coffers are empty. James and his father are deeply in debt to a neighboring kingdom.\nAnton: I don't understand.\nJack: If James can't pay back what he owes, they'll plunder this realm, and burn it to the ground.\nAnton: Now I understand.\nJack: It's bad.\nAnton: Will the other kingdom only accept gold coins?\nJack: Well, it depends. A magic bean, for instance, would be worth a thousand coins, but... You don't have any of those back home. ...Do you?\nAnton: No. No beans. We do have treasure. Enough to pay off your debts, I bet.\nJack: You would help us?\nAnton: Without question. If I'm going to stay here for good, might as well make sure it's a nice kingdom and not, you know - burned to the ground.\nJack: You are our hero.\n-[Storybrooke]-\n(In the woods, Anton is sitting on a log and looking forlornly at the river. Regina approaches him.)\nAnton: Get away from me!\nRegina: I'm here to help you.\nAnton: No. You're human. I hate humans.\n(Regina continues to walk towards him.)\nAnton: Don't come any closer! Or I'll kill you.\nRegina: Look, I hear you're in town cause you want to kill someone. I can help. I have no love for this Prince, either, and if you want to destroy this town to get to him... Well, I'm happy to do my part. This will make you bigger. It will return you to your former glory.\n(He takes the proffered mushroom and takes a bite. In a puff of blue smoke, he returns to his former giant size.)\nRegina: Now, get to work! As I'm sure you're aware, that mushroom won't last forever.\n-[Boston]-\n(Emma, Mr. Gold and Henry are waiting by their gate. Mr. Gold is pacing back and forth.)\nEmma: Do you want something to eat?\nMr. Gold: No.\nEmma: Is something wrong?\nMr. Gold: Stop asking me that! I'll be right back.\n(Mr. Gold leaves and enters the public washroom. He enters one of the stalls and locks the door. Still anxious, he starts to pace back and forth, until he suddenly drops his cane and begins violently punching the toilet seat cover dispenser on the wall. Afterward, Mr. Gold leans against the wall and looks down at his bloodied hand. He waves his hand over the wounds, but nothing happens. He tries again with the same result. Henry enters the washroom and calls out for him.)\nHenry: Mr. Gold? Mr. Gold? We're boarding soon. Are you coming?\n(He ignores Henry.)\n-[Fairy Tale Land - Past]-\n(Anton has returned to the castle and is gathering treasure. Arlo finds him there.)\nArlo: Anton. Anton, where have you been? We were worried.\nAnton: I needed to get away for a little while. So, I went down below to see things for myself.\nArlo: You went to the human world? Do you have any idea how dangerous that could be?\nAnton: I met friends there - friends who understand me. Who like me. And I plan to go back for good.\nArlo: Anton... I know we tease you. But we love you. You're our brother. You know that. You expect these humans to just welcome you with open arms? You could crush them.\nAnton: There's magic that can change me to their size. And, with this treasure, we can all be happy.\n(Outside, the sound of birds can be heard.)\nArlo: Sentry birds. Someone has trespassed on our land. You told the humans you were coming here, didn't you? You showed them the beanstalk.\n-[Storybrooke]-\n(Mary Margaret and David watch from a distance as Anton terrorizes the town.)\nAnton: That's right! Run! Run!\n(He picks up a car and throws it in David and Mary Margaret's direction, then continues his path of destruction. The citizens of Storybrooke scramble for safety as Mary Margaret and David follow Anton.)\nDavid: Head to the town hall! Bring anyone you find on the way! Somebody get Leroy!\nMMB: Guess we found our giant. I just didn't think he would be so...\nDavid: Giant?\nMMB: My mistake.\nDavid: Ever stop one before?\nMMB: Nope.\nDavid: Well... Here's to new firsts.\n(David yells to Anton to get his attention.)\nDavid: Wait! You don't have to do this!\nAnton: Yeah, I do. You destroyed everything in my life. Now you're going to know what that feels like.\nDavid: The man who hurt you? That wasn't me. That was my twin brother James. We were separated at birth. He was raised by a... A ruthless King.\nAnton: You're not James?\nDavid: No!\nAnton: Then where is he?\nDavid: He paid the ultimate price for his arrogance. He's dead! There is nothing more you can do to him.\nMMB: We're on your side, Anton! We're good! We're here because of you. You know our daughter Emma. You gave her the magic compass.\nAnton: Emma? Let me talk to her. She says you're okay, then I'll stop.\n(Leroy has arrived and joins Mary Margaret.)\nMMB: She's kind of out of town.\nAnton: Really?\nMMB: But when she gets back, I know she'll really want to talk to you.\nAnton: How convenient. Everyone I'm looking for isn't around! All you humans do is lie, and cheat, and kill, and I'm sick of it!\n(Anton charges after them.)\n-[Fairy Tale Land - Past]-\n(Anton and Arlo head to the beanstalk, where they find James and Jack.)\nArlo: Humans. Let's kill them.\nAnton: No, no, no! It's not like that. Arlo, these are my friends, James and Jack. Guys, you didn't have to come up here. The treasure's ready to go.\nJames: Oh, we're not here for the treasure. We're here for the beans. All of them.\nAnton: But... You're my friends. H-how-\n(Jack draws her sword.)\nJack: No, we're not. If you and your people want to save your lives, take us to the beans.\nArlo: No. We may live in peace, but we will fight to protect what is ours.\nJames: Then a fight is what you shall have.\n(James draws his sword. Jack and James charge towards the giants.)\n-[Storybrooke]-\n(Mary Margaret, David, and Leroy run down the streets of Storybrooke as Anton chases after them.)\nLeroy: So let me get this straight - you got a twin brother?\nDavid: Yeah.\nLeroy: His name is James?\nDavid: Right.\nLeroy: Well, your name is James.\nDavid: No, actually, it's not.\nLeroy: It's Charming, then?\nMMB: No, that's the nickname I gave him.\nLeroy: Hey, hold on. What the hell is your name?\nDavid: David.\nLeroy: Your curse name?\nDavid: My real name!\nLeroy: What, you're David, James, and Charming? Is David like a middle name?\nDavid: No! It's my name-name.\nLeroy: You know what? I'm going to call you whatever I damn well please! Is that okay?!\nDavid: Sure, Leroy.\nLeroy: So what's the plan?\nDavid: Lead the giant away from here, so he can't hurt anyone.\nMMB: Wait. If we keep heading in this direction, we're going to hit the town line.\nDavid: Okay, new plan.\n(The three of them stop near the docks. David approaches the giant.)\nMMB: What are you doing?\nDavid: Giving him what he wants. Anton! How about we make a deal?\nAnton: I don't make deals with humans.\nDavid: Just hear me out. I'll surrender myself to you, if you spare the lives of everyone in Storybrooke.\nMMB: David, you can't do this.\nDavid: If I don't, the whole town will suffer. I can't allow that. Well, what do you say?\nAnton: Deal.\n(Anton lunges towards David and tries to jump on him. However, Mary Margaret pulls David out of the way at the last second, and Anton ends up jumping straight through the ground. Stuck, the mushroom's effects then wear off, and Anton seems to disappear in a puff of blue smoke. All that's left is a large hole in the ground.)\nMMB: Where did he go?\nDavid: I'm not sure.\n(They head over to the hole to investigate, where they find Anton hanging on to an underground pipe.)\n-[Fairy Tale Land - Past]-\n(Anton runs through the castle as the battle rages outside. He meets up with Arlo.)\nArlo: Anton. The human armies are overrunning us. Abraham and Andre have fallen. The human swords are poisoned.\nAnton: This is all because of me. I've ruined everything.\nArlo: No, you still have a chance to save us.\nAnton: How?\nArlo: The beans, Anton. You must raze the fields.\nAnton: No!\nArlo: If the humans take the beans, they will bring their violence to every realm. It is your birthright to protect the beans. Right now, that means destroying them.\n-[Storybrooke]-\n(The dwarves, Granny, and Ruby have arrived on the scene with a truck and some rope. Anton is still hanging onto the pipe below.)\nDavid: That better hold.\nLeroy: It'll hold.\nGranny: I got this.\n(Granny ties the rope to the back of the truck and Leroy throws the rope down the side of the hole. Mary Margaret then kisses David.)\nMMB: Most people would let that giant die after what he's done.\nDavid: You wouldn't.\n(David wraps the rope around his waist and begins to shimmy down the hole.)\nDavid: Alright, Anton! I'm coming down!\n(He gets down to Anton and extends his hand.)\nDavid: Take my hand.\nAnton: No!\nDavid: No?\nAnton: I don't want to go back up there. I should just let go!\nDavid: You'll die.\nAnton: Maybe death hurts less than life.\nDavid: If you really wanted to die, you would have let go already. Now take my hand!\n(Anton finally grabs David's hand and the people above pull them out of the hole.)\nLeroy: Come on.\nMMB: Almost! A little more!\n(David and Anton are successfully pulled up. Mary Margaret hugs David.)\nAnton: You saved my life.\nDavid: That's what we do.\nAnton: Thank you.\nLeroy: You're welcome.\nDavid: We're not all the same, Anton. I don't know what my brother did to you, but... That's not us.\nAnton: You have no idea.\n-[Fairy Tale Land - Past]-\n(In the treasure room, Jack is fighting Arlo, while James stuffs treasure into a sack. Jack stabs Arlo in the ankle with the sword, causing him to yell in pain. However, Jack isn't quick enough to get away, and Arlo grabs Jack.)\nJack: James!\n(Arlo takes Jack's sword and stabs her with it. He then tosses her and the sword onto the ground. He falls over due to the poison, just as Anton enters the room.)\nAnton: Arlo? No... No, no, no, no!\n(James, having filled the sack with treasure, goes to leave. Jack is dying on the floor.)\nJack: James! Please...\nJames: I'm sorry, Jack. But I have a kingdom to run. I'm sure you understand.\n(James exits, leaving Jack behind. Anton tends to Arlo.)\nArlo: Anton... The poison. It's in my blood. Did you...\nAnton: All destroyed. The fields and every last bean.\nArlo: Oh, good. Good. That's what's important.\nAnton: No. Everyone else is dead. You can't die, too, please!\nArlo: I know your path is hard. But someday, you will know which road to choose. And when you do, you will need this.\n(Arlo takes out a vial with a piece of beanstalk inside. He hands it to Anton.)\nArlo: A preserved cutting...from the stalk. Plant it. New beans will grow.\nAnton: You had me salt the land. Nothing can grow here.\nArlo: Then someday, you will find... New land.\nAnton: How? Arlo? Arlo?! No...\n-[Storybrooke]-\n(Anton and the rescue group enter Granny's Diner.)\nLeroy: This is Granny's. She makes a mean lasagna and runs an inn, so I'm sure we can set you up with a room till you find a place.\nAnton: Thanks, but I think I'll set up camp in the woods.\nLeroy: The woods?\nAnton: Yeah, I'm better off alone. I'm not too good at fitting in.\nLeroy: You're in the right place. Storybrooke's got all kinds - dwarves, fairies, werewolves, you name it. Ruby, beers all around!\nMMB: We all miss our land, Anton. But this is our home now.\nAnton: You never think about going back?\nMMB: Of course we do. It's just not possible.\nDavid: We have no way to get there.\nAnton: How's the farmland here?\nDavid: Pretty good. Why?\n(Anton takes out the vial with the piece of beanstalk.)\nAnton: The stem is from a beanstalk. If I plant it, it should be able to grow some magic beans. And then, you just may have a way.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Mary Margaret, David, Anton, and the dwarves have gathered in a field. Anton checks the soil.)\nDavid: Well, what's the verdict?\nAnton: Soil's got a nice loamy feel. Lot of minerals. The beans should grow well here. Only one problem.\nMMB: What's that?\nAnton: Cora. This is why she brought me. She wanted me to grow beans. So whatever she plans to do with them... Can't be good.\nMMB: Then we won't let her get to them.\nLeroy: No one touches our crop.\nAnton: Your crop? I thought you guys were miners?\nLeroy: Work is work. It's what we do. So what do you say? You up for some help?\nAnton: Okay.\nLeroy: Happy!\n(Happy hands a pick axe to Anton.)\nLeroy: Here. To help break up the earth.\n(Anton looks down, and the name 'Tiny' appears on the handle.)\nAnton: 'Tiny'. My brothers used to call me that.\nLeroy: Axe never lies.\nDavid: Wait a second. I did my time in the mines. How come I didn't get one of those?\nLeroy: Cause you ain't a dwarf. Welcome aboard, brother.\n(The dwarves and Anton begin to hack away at the earth. They whistle.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Belle is reading in her room at the hospital. Greg enters.)\nGreg: Hey. It's okay.\nBelle: Who, uh... Who are you?\nGreg: My name's Greg, okay? I... I'm a patient here, just like you. I... I'm really sorry to bother you, but... I'm the one that was driving the car in... In the accident.\nBelle: Oh. Are you okay?\nGreg: Yeah. Yeah, they, um... They patched me up pretty good. Look, I... I overheard you talking. About how you saw a guy with a ball of fire.\nBelle: And you think I'm crazy, too. Well, I did see it. I-\nGreg: Hey, I know that you're not crazy.\nBelle: You do?\nGreg: Cause I saw it, too.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(David exits Granny's Diner with two coffees. He hands one to Mary Margaret, who is waiting outside.)\nDavid: Here's to not getting squashed by a giant.\nMMB: I'll drink to that.\nDavid: Sometimes I wonder how things would've turned out if I had been the one raised by King George instead of my brother. You know, would I have been...corrupt like him?\nMMB: Never.\nDavid: Same blood ran through our veins.\nMMB: Mm, but your hearts are different. You may not believe it, but trust me - I know you, Charming. I had a lot of fun today.\nDavid: Fun?\nMMB: Uh-huh.\nDavid: Almost getting killed is fun?\nMMB: Yeah. I missed our adventures.\nDavid: Me, too. It was kind of fun. You know, we could do this all the time. When the beans grow, we could go back. Everyone could go home.\nMMB: I don't know.\nDavid: What don't you know?\nMMB: Home is where our family is. And that's here. I don't know if Emma would come with us, and I am not going to be separated from her again.\nDavid: You're worried about her.\nMMB: Aren't you?\nDavid: Of course, but... Emma... Emma can take care of herself, and I'm sure wherever she and Henry are, they're safe.\n-[Boston]-\n(Emma, Henry, and Mr. Gold have boarded the plane and are waiting for takeoff.

The only thing that could make this day better? Is more frosting.\n(Emma looks down and notices Mr. Gold's bandaged hand.)\nEmma: It's going to be alright.

As is this.\nFrancis: You and your men must rest here before you leave. (women laughing) Your kisses are more easily attained than your words. I left impulsively.\nMary: You did.\nFrancis: And now I have returned with Lola's child. I held him and... I don't know what role he'll have at court, but I want to be a part of my son's life. Of this child's life, but we will have others. Mary, my father's indiscretions were blatant, but out of respect for his wife, he gave Bash no title or standing. It hurt him. And it hurt me to see it.\nMary: The eyes of the world are watching to see if we will... If I can bear an heir. Not just for France. For Scotland. And for England as well. I know this has nothing to do with the role you decide to have in your son's life...\nFrancis: Well, perhaps it should.\nMary: Those who are close to us... even here at court will know the truth. Your mother has guessed it already. Spend time with your son absolutely, but...\nFrancis: But don't claim him. Officially, you mean.\nMary: Yes.\nCatherine: Thank you. I'm surprised to see you. My deepest sympathies for the loss of your son Eduard. Can I get you anything? Some lemonade?\nNarcisse: I thought this castle would be the safest place for him. Why wasn't it?\nCatherine: Bring us some whiskey.\nNostradamus: Lord Narcisse is here. Asking a lot of questions about his son's death. I explained that he showed symptoms of plague, high fever, rash.\nMary: You are good to cover for me. Lord Narcisse will never know. His son did die of plague. His body will tell the tale. Eduard murdered an entire household to kill one foe. Since he cared so little for people, it's fitting that he died among the lowborn. I have asked much of you... not the least that you betray your very dangerous friend Catherine. She was mortified that she overreacted to her symptoms. She hates being vulnerable. But it is hard not to enjoy it. We tried to save lives. I owe you. And I will protect you.\nCatherine: So many people died here. Nobles, servants alike. I was in my chambers when your son took ill. But Nostradamus, he...\nNarcisse: Yes. I've already spoken with your court physician. A... a father can't help but wonder about his son's final days. I survived by fleeing to the country. I feel that I should've sent for him.\nCatherine: There was nothing you could do.\nNarcisse: : I need to go see him now. You do understand, don't you? (groans) When was this room sealed?\nGuards: Two weeks ago, my lord.\nNarcisse: Most nobles died in their chambers. Were many nobles sent here by mistake?\nGuards: Couldn't say, sir. It was a living hell. Do you see him?\nNarcisse: Not yet. That is my son. Wrap him. Carefully. (moaning nearby) Who's there? This one is still alive.\nGuards: How could anyone still be alive? He must be immune.\nMan: Water.\nNarcisse: That is my son. Were you with him? Did you see him die? We will get you some water and something to eat. And then you are going tell me all about what happened to my son. (laughter, clamoring)\nCatherine: Ah, this is nothing compared to what we'll do for your coronation. But your safe return is cause for celebration.\nFrancis: It's nice to see some joy in this castle after so much grief. I hear you had a hand in our new chambers as well.\nCatherine: One bedroom for husband and wife. Good luck to both of you with that. I thought Narcisse was leaving with his son's body. Why is he back with so many nobles?\nNarcisse: King Francis.\nFrancis: Narcisse. My lords. I'm pleased to see you're all alive and well. In the wake of the plague, I will be calling on all of you to enforce my laws. Together you control vast regions of France. Some of you will be valued additions to my royal council.\nNarcisse: Of course, King Francis. But we're here to ask something of you as well. Justice.\nFrancis: What's this about exactly?\nNarcisse: My son Eduard... was murdered. Here in your castle while you were away. By Nostradamus, the court physician. I don't know what grudge you held against my son.\nNostradamus: I had no argument with him.\nNarcisse: Then why did you make false diagnosis?Why did you condemn him to death?\nFrancis: These are serious allegations.\nNarcisse: My son was healthy when he was thrown in with servants riddled with plague. I know this because a witness, a survivor, has told me this tale. My son was deliberately infected.\nMary: I assure you, if a mistake was made, Nostradamus intended no harm.\nNarcisse: Assure us all... your loyal nobility, that we are still safe under your rule. We who collect your coin, we who grow your food, we who provide your soldiers, we who uphold your laws. Hold the murderer of my son accountable to these same laws. And show us that no life, especially one of our own, may be taken with impunity. (gasping, murmuring)\nFrancis: Take Nostradamus away for questioning.\nMary: Eduard murdered an entire household... men, women and children. I did what I had to.\nFrancis: And Narcisse knows it was you who killed his son?\nMary: I was the one who forced Eduard into the plague room against his will. If there was a survivor, he would have witnessed everything.\nCatherine: There was another survivor of your crimes, Mary. Me. You drugged me, didn't you? You were so adamant to stand up to the nobles, and I got sick just when you needed me out of the way.\nMary: I had to stop you.\nCatherine: Oh, you wouldn't delve into my poisons without help. It was Nostradamus. Your actions spared no one, saved nothing and cost us all dearly. Narcisse wants the guards who brought his son to the catacombs executed as well.\nMary: We don't have to accede to his demands. You and Henry might have bowed to the nobles, but we won't.\nCatherine: We kept the nobles happy. If they feel betrayed, they can rise up against you. I've seen revolts firsthand, a full-scale rebellion could mean the end of your reign.\nFrancis: I know that you want to do things differently, but I'm not sure that this is the time. The plague shortages have given too much power to Narcisse. The nobles follow him now, and they are watching our every move.\nMary: Then let them watch you, and that you be above reproach. This was my mistake and I'll fix it.\n(indistinct conversation, hammer clinking) (horse whinnies)\nMan: Whoa.\nLeith: Oh... Lord Castleroy.\nCastleroy: Wasn't this enough for you? A kitchen boy, given some of the best lands in the region. You had to have my daughter, too?\nLeith: Lord Castleroy, I am so sorry. Yvette was kind and...\nCastleroy: She was everything you told Greer you wanted. Rich and innocent and my daughter. How Greer would have suffered to see your rise, and what a close view she'd have had.\nLeith: I can assure you that I didn't realize who she was until after we...\nCastleroy: If my daughter had never met you, she would be alive!\nLeith: I would never have hurt her.\nCastleroy: I don't know that, and neither do you. Given the proximity you would have had to the woman I know you love.\nLeith: Look, please, just... look, wait...\nGreer: Leith, no! (Grunts)\nCastleroy: Stay away from my family. Or I will destroy you.\nNarcisse: Queen Mary. Where is your husband?\nMary: I would prefer it if we settled this matter privately. I think you know who's truly responsible for Eduard's death.\nNarcisse: You are. But, as you are a queen, you're nearly untouchable. Nearly. But those that lied for you, I can reach easily enough. That is how I will punish you.\nMary: Your son was a monster. He asked me to murder his enemy, and when I refused, he poisoned an entire household.\nNarcisse: Why didn't you arrest him?\nMary: I let my anger get the best of me. And my outrage.\nNarcisse: Hand what of mine? He was my son! He was loyal and obedient and he had his whole life ahead of him. He was to marry an archduchess, gain one of the most prized farming regions in France...\nMary: He was to marry into land? He told me he was already married. That Voland had slept with his wife. Why did he really want Voland dead? You also said he was obedient. Was he following your orders? I am queen. You will answer my questions. Why did you want Voland dead? I command you!\nNarcisse: No, you command nothing! I don't fear you, I don't fear your husband! Because without me, without the other nobles, your power disappears. We are the outside world, and we surround you. There is a consensus amongst the other nobles, given my son's station, that an example must be made. So when the dawn comes, Nostradamus and your guards will be drawn and quartered.\nMary: That is a horrific and agonizing death.\nNarcisse: This is what they want. This is what will satisfy them. And you will learn never to cross me again.\nFrancis: My mother's been negotiating to spare Nostradamus, but it's no use. Narcisse wants retribution, and he has the nobles on his side.\nMary: Murdering innocent men to teach me a lesson. He's more wicked than his son.\nFrancis: Why didn't you wait? You could have had him arrested.\nMary: If I had, Narcisse would have pressured us to release him. We'd be in the same position we're in now with him trying to force your hand.\nFrancis: If his son were alive, Narcisse wouldn't be consumed with revenge. It was reckless, Mary.\nMary: I saw an entire family be murdered. My rage took hold. It might not have been the best decision, but it was justified.\nFrancis: It was a choice that you made alone. What is it?\nMary: I know I told you to go to Lola, but then the plague came and you knowingly abandoned me to a nightmare. You are the king who deserted his castle, and I am the queen who was left behind, alone. Alone because of your mistakes. Out of all the people you could have slept with, did it have to be one of my ladies?One of my closest friends?\nFrancis: We can't afford to do this now.\nMary: If you bow to Narcisse now, you'll be doing it for the rest of your rule. What kind of king do you want to be?\nFrancis: I've been trying to figure out what kind of king I can be. Whether there is a way to stop this execution without destroying my relationship with some very powerful nobles.\nMary: If only we had something to leverage against Narcisse, we could force him to back down.\nFrancis: Conde suspects Narcisse of murdering families to take their lands. I'll send my brother to the villages where he acquired property during the plague.\nMary: You're looking for evidence of murder. Something to blackmail him with.\nFrancis: Anything. What is it?\nMary: I believe Eduard was acting on his father's orders. I don't know why Narcisse wanted Voland dead, but I'm going to try and find out.\nFrancis: The execution is at dawn.\nMary: I promised Nostradamus my protection. One way or another, we have to find something.\nMaid: These are Lord Voland's chambers.\nMary: Leave me. Thank you.\nLola: Mary.\nMary: Lola, what are you doing here?\nLola: Francis explained your situation with Narcisse. I wanted to help.\nMary: Francis shared that with you?\nLola: I was with Francis when we met Narcisse on the road. It gave me chills to see him here at court. I could see Francis was troubled and I asked him what was wrong.\nMary: When was this?\nLola: When he asked me how the baby was doing. Mary, I know our situation is painful...\nMary: And for you, too. Does he have a name yet?\nLola: I call him Robert, after my youngest brother. If Francis claims him, he may choose another name.\nMary: I suppose it would be best for you, if he did. You'd rise above speculation and gossip. You would both gain status and respect.\nLola: I just want to be with my child. The more time I spend with him, the less anything else seems to matter.\nMary: It's all right to take joy in being a mother. You don't have to hide that from me.\nLola: What is it?\nMary: It's from the privy council, to Lord Voland. \"In response to your urgent request... \"\nLola: It says Voland was desperately seeking an audience with the king before he died.\nMary: Well, you said you want to help. I need you to find out whatever you can about Voland's final hours. He wanted to tell Francis something... I need to know what it was.\nLeith: It is you. When they announced that you were here, I, uh... I didn't believe it.\nGreer: I feel as if I betrayed you. I didn't mean to tell Lord Castleroy what you said. What you said in anger. But at the time...\nLeith: You thought it was true. That I would steal the heart of another just to wound yours.\nGreer: I was upset when I saw you and Yvette together. I realized how jealous I sounded to Lord Castleroy, so I told him your words. As if it was just my concern for his daughter. I did it to protect myself.\nLeith: You're good at that, aren't you?\nGreer: Not really. I've poisoned everything. There's little but hate and mistrust between all of us. (sighs) I wish I could turn back time, but I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry and... I pray the day will come when I no longer regret that I loved you. Please don't blame yourself for Yvette's death. If I'd let you go to her...\nLeith: Never tell your fiancé that. Let it be, Greer. What's done is done. Don't cause him any more pain. Let that be a vow that we both keep. You should go. Don't come back.\nSebastan: I'm investigating Lord Narcisse. I've heard many of the dead lost their lands to him.\nGravedigger: They were murdered. He plucked the deeds to their lands from their stiff, cold fingers. Or so I'm told.\nSebastian: Do you have any proof?\nGravedigger: There's proof of murders, theirs and plenty of others, if you want to dig it up. It's all under there, buried with the rest of the unfortunates.\nSebastian: In the same mass grave with all the actual plague victims. Corpses came by the cartful, the sick and the murdered. And once they're tossed in... who's going to ask questions? (sighs) Don't take it too hard, my lord. Same thing happens every plague. Justice suffers and dies with the rest of us.\nWoman: Deesh-kin... aarin kir mograndee.\nSebastian: Who are you? Why are you doing that?\nWoman: From the castle, now, are you? I am. I hear the nobles locked themselves in with cakes and fine wines, while we watched our loved ones rot and turn black before our eyes.\nSebastian: There were many deaths at court as well.\nWoman: Bury them well, mind you. So many. Wickedly mistreated, not just in life, but in death. Do people really expect them to go?\nSebastian: What do you mean?\nWoman: It's hard enough to get spirits to leave us, but now? There's a door between the dead and the living, and the plague kicked it down. And if the dead aren't guided through... the door stays open. The door is open. They'll get to us before you know it. There will be...\nSebastiab: A reckoning.\nMary: So we have no proof to use against Narcisse unless we want to dig up mass graves and release the plague?\nSebastian: If Narcisse is using the plague to cover his crimes, he's not the only one. Neighbours, Catholics, Protestants... they're killing each other. Even a cardinal's body was found in an alley with his throat slit.\nFrancis: A cardinal? Who?\nSebastian: Cardinal Morosini, killed for the gold in his vestments, they say. (Door closes)\nLola: I'm here to see Mary.\nMary: What did you find?\nLola: I spoke with a castle page. Before Lord Voland joined his family in their chambers, he insisted on taking confession. I had to bribe a few altar boys, but I got the priest's name. Father Lucien.\nMary: Where do we find this priest?\nFrancis: You look troubled, Brother. I know you call Nostradamus friend.\nSebastian: I do. And he's a friend we may need.\nFrancis: What do you mean?\nSebastian: He has certain skills . And I know that you don't believe in them or the occult. But something has changed out there. There's talk in the village that the dead are still with us.\nFrancis: People feel guilty for surviving. They torture themselves.\nSebastian: No, a guard heard screams of the dying from an empty room. Servants claim that old castle ghosts have returned. And a woman in the village claims that all this death and injustice has left a door open between this world and the next and some of the dead are on the wrong side of it.\nFrancis: Still here among the living?\nSebastian: And that they stay because they were treated wrongly. Either not given proper burial or cut down unjustly.\nFrancis: Murdered. What does this woman think the dead want?\nSebastian: The truth revealed.\nFrancis: You mean revenge.\nCatherine: I loved Henry. But he was a terrible husband and a worse father. What kind of a father do you hope to be?\nFrancis: Nothing like him.\nCatherine: Really? Then what will you do about Lola's child? Will you claim him?\nFrancis: I haven't decided.\nCatherine: You must be worried he might be your only child. I'm speaking to you as a mother. As your mother. I can tell you that if you do not claim him, there will be a distance between you and that boy for the rest of your lives. He will never be king. But he might be your only chance at being a father. And I can promise you that raising him will be the singular joy of your life.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(door creaks)\nGreer: Aloysius.

What I do fear is Lord Narcisse.\nMary: I will stand against him. Father, I made a mistake a few weeks ago, and now innocent men could pay for it with their lives. Whatever Voland told you could save them. Please help me.\n(crickets chirping)\nFather: Lord Voland worked with Narcisse. They collected money for the Vatican, but greed interfered, and they kept some of the Church's gold for themselves. Cardinal Morosini discovered their crime.\nMary: Cardinal Morosini? He was found dead in a neighboring village.\nFather: Protestants were blamed but never identified. I know the truth. It was Narcisse and Voland who killed him. Voland's heart filled with remorse. Narcisse knew his resolve was weakening, so before Voland could confess to your king or to the Church...\nMary: He had him killed. Along with his entire family. (sighs) You understand we could destroy Narcisse with this. The Vatican would strip him of his power. You must testify to the king and to the assembled nobles at court.\nFather: But what I've told you I can never repeat. I'm just a lowly priest; Narcisse has people everywhere. I'd be dead in the blink of an eye.\nMary: He killed a cardinal! I could compel you.\nFather: For information taken in holy confession? The Vatican itself can't hear it. It doesn't exist.\nNarcisse: I know that your wife...\nFrancis: She is your queen.\nNarcisse: I know that your queen is working against me to stop the execution. She doesn't value my friendship, but you should.\nFrancis: Because you are a true friend to the Crown.\nNarcisse: Hmm. You don't like me, but you need me. My lands feed your people, your court. I kept Henry afloat long after his wars plunged France into debt.\nFrancis: I am aware of the Crown's debts.\nNarcisse: But not how in debt it is to me.\nLouis: I heard about the execution. If Lord Narcisse demanded it, those men are certainly innocent.\nNarcisse: Careful of your accusations. I could make some of my own.\nLouis: You've made them to others; you can make them to me.\nNarcisse: I believe this man to be a secret Protestant, a radical, practicing the faith of your enemies in England and Germany.\nFrancis: Is this true?\nLouis: No. I am a Catholic and a Frenchman. But I believe France should be ruled by you, not by blood money from Rome. The Vatican is corrupt... they're betraying their faith by allowing the strong to prey on the weak.\nNarcisse: You've proved my case for me. He is a radical. A Catholic who hates the Catholic Church.\nLouis: I hate any man that hides behind God while they murder and steal. Men like Narcisse, protected by the Church and the Crown. Your father built his power by giving the nobles what they wanted. If he were here now, he would let those men die.\nNarcisse: And what do you expect him to do, risk disenfranchising the nobles he depends on?\nLouis: Well, maybe it's time we change things, shift the power back to where it belongs, with you, our king. You're unsure of who to trust.\nFrancis: Yes, I am.\nLouis: Then trust no one but yourself. Trust your sense of what is right and what is wrong. Because when the dawn comes and those men are let outside, you'll have to decide what kind of king you want to be.\n(birds chirping)\n(sighs)\nCatherine: Have they hurt you?\n(door closes)\nNostradamus: They're going to lead me out soon. For last rites. Are you going to share your plan with me?\nCatherine: I'm afraid there is no plan, my old friend. I'm so sorry. But I shall make sure you are remembered. All your works will be published. I will have sonnets written... and... a statue built in Paris.\nNostradamus: A statue? Mm. After all I've done for you!\nCatherine: Do not blame me for the choices you have made! If you had stayed loyal to me, Eduard would still be alive, none of this would have happened. You... you brought this on yourself when you helped Mary. There is nothing I can do.\nNostradamus: You think you're untouchable... that your sins will stay buried, but they don't. Surely you realized that when you met your daughter.\nCatherine: Clarissa? She's dead and buried now. Mary killed her. You thought Clarissa's death fulfilled the prophecy. And that is why I supported Francis marrying... Is Clarissa alive? Tell me, Nostradamus. Have you seen her? Have you had another vision? Will Francis live beyond the death you once foresaw?\nNastradamus: Ask your statue.\nNarcisse: Conde. Where are the royals?\nLouis: I suppose they've chosen to look the other way. Someone must bear witness to this travesty. Innocent men shouldn't die alone. You won't die alone.\nMary: They're preparing for the drawing and quartering as we speak. We must do something.\nFrancis: We don't have any leverage against Narcisse.\nMary: We have the truth on our side and we have you. You are king. Doesn't that count for something?\nFrancis: Yeah, well, it's not enough, Mary. We need something that we can hold in our hands.\nMary: Well, perhaps Lord Voland kept a journal. Or wrote a letter. I have Lola looking now.\nFrancis: We're out of time.\nMary: I can't let these men die for my mistake.\nNarcisse: Do you know why they wrap the bindings all up the arms and legs? For a good, clean break. I've seen it done the other way, too, bonds at the wrists and ankles taking off just the hands and feet. You bleed to death as the one horse takes the lead and drags you behind. Which do you think will be more painful? Your death or my son's?\nNostradamus: I've seen your death. You'll suffer, too.\nNarcisse: And I have seen the suffering on every inch of my son's corpse. I will think of him as you die. You do the same.\n(shouting) (horse neighs) (shouting) (horse neighs)\nGuard: On my signal, spur your horses!\nMary: No, stop! Riders, dismount. Rein in your horses. Now.\nNarcisse: Even a queen needs grounds.\nMary: Unbind him. (whimpering) There will be no execution today.\nNarcisse: You have just lost France for you and your king. When the nobles hear of this...\nMary: I found Lord Voland's confession. Handwritten before his death.\nNarcisse: What are you talking about?\nMary: He wrote it all down how you both stole from the Vatican and then murdered the cardinal before he could inform on you. Voland's remorse that followed, his need to clear his accounts with God, and his fear that you would silence him before he could. His confession is in the hands of a messenger headed to your friends in Rome as we speak to reassure the Vatican that no life, especially one of their own, can be taken with impunity.\nFrancis: Mary. I will handle this.\nMary: But I have proof.\nFrancis: Not anymore.\nMary: My letters. You intercepted my riders. Why? You don't have to bow to him.\nFrancis: Mary, leave us. You, too, Conde.\nMary: I am your queen. You owe me an explanation. You owe France and your subjects a just rule.\nFrancis: Go to our chambers, where private discussions between husbands and wives should take place.\nMary: I am not just your wife.\nFrancis: You are not king either. Leave us now.\nNarcisse: I always thought you should have married a common girl, like your father. Rich, of course, but without a title she felt obligated to club people with.\nFrancis: I don't like you.\nNarcisse: I don't care. You need me. I'm glad that you've realized that. Lord Voland's seal.\nFrancis: I stopped the riders because I understand that we need each other. Nostradamus is a favorite of my mother's, and none of these men really caused your son's death. You will free them as a favor to me.\nNarcisse: That might be difficult to explain to the nobles.\nFrancis: You riled them into a frenzy on your behalf. Now tell them you are satisfied. Manage them, and I will manage my wife.\nNarcisse: There will need to be some satisfaction, if you want all of this to go away.\nFrancis: No more bloodshed.\nNarcisse: Land. Of my choosing. (bell tolling in distance) Nostradamus and the guards have been freed. You were brilliant.\nMary: And he didn't ask to see the contents of the letters?\nFrancis: I burned them before he could see they were forged. We have Narcisse at bay, but...\nMary: Well, what is it? What's wrong?\nFrancis: I had to give him something else as well.\n(horse neighs)\nNarcisse: This is very fine land.\nLeith: Who are you?\nNarcisse: It's a rare parcel. Undamaged by fire. Still producing. And all that separates two larger parcels of mine. The king has deeded this land to me.\nLeith: That's impossible. Why would he take it away?\nNarcisse: Ask King Francis yourself. He's requested your presence at court.\nLeith: At court? But I can't go there.\nNarcisse: You can. And you will.\nFrancis: I don't know what's changed your mind. You were right before; a politician is a liar's job. Even today I had to betray a friend to save lives.\nSebastian: Well, this job is different. Enforcing the laws, keeping the peace beyond the castle walls. My wife tells me that in Scotland they call this the king's deputy.\nFrancis: Ah.\nSebastian: The realm is growing unstable. You need someone out there you can actually trust. Why are you kneeling?\nSebastian: You're the king, and I'm nothing. Until you make me something.\nFrancis: Don't say that. You're my brother.\nSebastian: Then give me the job already. Do it up properly. Use my sword.\nFrancis: Very well. Sebastian, I hereby appoint you the king's deputy, with all rights and apportionments so accruing.\nMary: Nostradamus, you're too injured to ride.\nNostradamus: I have to. What will you tell Catherine?\nMary: That you had another vision. Of a better life. God willing. (baby gurgles)\nFrancis: Mary?Why did you ask me to the nursery?\nMary: Your father was King Henry II of the House of Valois. You are Francis II, the king of France. I'm Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots. Whatever happens to us while we live and when we are long gone, nothing can change that or take it away.\nFrancis: I don't understand.\nMary: The world is a cruel place. And it's cruelest to the weak. They are bullied and sacrificed, mocked and murdered and they die in agony.\nFrancis: Mary, why are you talking...\nMary: Give him your name. Give your baby your name.\nFrancis: Not even my name can make him safe.\nMary: No, but it can make him safer.\nFrancis: Mary...\nMary: If you think I don't know the risks, I do. But if I don't want to end up like Catherine, I can't push this child away like she did with Bash. I have to open my heart. So... ... do right by him, with my blessing, and claim him as your own. And our marriage will be stronger for it.\n(baby gurgling)\n(door opens)\nFrancis: I'm never sure that I'm holding him right.\nNurse: Oh, I could show you. Support his head, like so. See? I remember holding you in my arms when you were this little.\nFrancis: I beg your pardon?\nNurse: When I gave you life, I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever done. All the treaties I'd made, all the wars and the whores were nothing compared to that.\nFrancis: Who are you talking to?\nNurse: Don't you recognize your own father? Usurper. (gasps)\nFrancis: What did you just say?\nNurse: Did I say something, Your Grace?\nFrancis: You don't remember?\n(baby crying)\nNurse: Remember what?\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

MORRIS MINI, DAY\nAMY is holding what appears to be a map and gives directions to RORY.\nAMY: OK, left, sharp turn!\nEXT. CORN FIELD, DAY\nRORY turns and they cross a previous path.\nINT. MORRIS MINI, DAY\nAMY: OK, right! No, no, no I mean left. (turns the map around) No, sorry right, right! I definitely meant right.\nEXT. CORN FIELD, DAY\nRORY continues driving.\nINT. MORRIS MINI, DAY\nAMY: Now loop the loop!\nEXT. CORN FIELD, DAY\nRORY drives.\nINT. MORRIS MINI, DAY\nAMY: Stop! Stop!\nRORY slams on the brakes.\nEXT. CORN FIELD, DAY\nAMY and RORY get out of the car to see the DOCTOR and the TARDIS in the middle of the crop circle they just made. The DOCTOR holds up the Leadworth paper with a headline that reads \"Leadworth's Crop Circle\".\nDOCTOR: Seriously?\nThe camera pulls upwards and we get an aerial view of the field. The \"circle\" reads \"Doctor\".\nRORY: You never answer your phone. (closes car door)\nAMY: (walks to the DOCTOR) OK, you've had all summer. Have you found her? Have you found Melody?\nDOCTOR: (hands RORY the paper) Permission?\nRORY: Granted.\nDOCTOR: (hugs AMY) You know who she grows up to be, so you know I WILL find her.\nAMY: (ends the hug) But you haven't yet?\nRORY: Hang on, what's this bit?\nThe picture in the newspaper shows an extra line through the word.\nAMY: That wasn't us.\nThe DOCTOR grabs the paper from RORY and tries to locate where it would be. The DOCTOR stops and lowers the paper, AMY and RORY standing behind him, as they hear an engine and see a red Corvette coming straight at them. They scream and dive out of the way. The car stops, inches away from the TARDIS. A young black woman steps out of the car. AMY and RORY stand and the DOCTOR is lying on the ground at her feet.\nWOMAN: You said he was funny, you never said he was hot.\nRORY: Mels?\nAMY: What are you doing here?\nMELS: Following you, what do you think?\nThe DOCTOR uses the car to stand up.\nRORY: Um, where did you get the car?\nMELS: It's mine...\nPolice sirens wail in the distance.\nMELS: ..ish.\nAMY: Oh, Mels, not again?\nRORY: You can't keep doing this. You'll end up in prison.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, hello, Doctor not following this. Doctor very lost. You never said I was hot?!\nMELS: (points at the TARDIS) Is that the phone box! The bigger-on-the-inside phone box? (caresses the TARDIS) Time travel - that's just brilliant.\nThe DOCTOR leans against the TARDIS next to MELS.\nMELS: Yeah, I've heard a lot about you. I'm their best mate.\nDOCTOR: Then why don't I know you? I danced with everyone at the wedding. The women were all brilliant, the men were a bit shy.\nMELS: I don't do weddings.\nThe police sirens sound closer.\nMELS: And that's me out of time. (pulls a gun on the Doctor)\nAMY: Mels!\nRORY: For God's sake!\nAMY: What are you doing?\nMELS: I need out of here, now!\nDOCTOR: Anywhere in particular?\nMELS: Well, let's see! You've got a time machine, I've got a gun.

AMELIA'S BEDROOM, DAY\nAMELIA is going through her box of Raggedy Doctor crafts as MELS watches.\nMELS: Is he hot?\nAMELIA: No, he's funny.\nMELS: But how can he travel in time?\nAMELIA: Because he's got a time machine, stupid!\nRORY enters the room.\nRORY: I thought we were playing hide and seek. I've been hiding for hours!\nAMELIA: Well, we just haven't found you yet!\nRORY: OK. Hi, Mels.\nMELS: Hi, Rory.\nRORY leaves.\nINT. CLASSROOM, DAY\nMELS is standing as she is questioned by the teacher.\nTEACHER: Mels, did you not understand the question? I'm asking you why the Titanic sank.\nMELS: Because the DOCTOR didn't save it. Except you don't know about the Doctor because you're stupid!\nINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY, DAY\nMELS exits the Head Teacher's office. AMELIA is waiting and follows.\nEXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND, DAY\nAMELIA questions MELS as they walk through the playground.\nAMELIA: Why are you always in trouble? You're the most in trouble in the whole school, except for boys.\nMELS: And you.\nAMELIA: I count as a boy.\nThey walk past a blindfolded RORY.\nRORY: Am I getting warm?\nAMELIA: Yes, Rory.\nINT. CLASSROOM, DAY\nMELS and AMY are now teenagers. MELS is standing being questioned by another teacher.\nTEACHER: Mels?\nMELS: A significant factor in Hitler's rise to power was the fact that the Doctor didn't stop him.\nINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY, DAY\nMELS exits the Head Teacher's office. AMY is waiting and follows.\nAMY: I can't keep doing this!\nINT. POLICE STATION, HALL, DAY\nMELS is released from her cell and AMY is waiting.\nAMY: Mels! (runs after her)\nINT. AMY'S BEDROOM, DAY\nMELS flops on the bed and picks up the toy TARDIS. RORY is sitting in a chair and AMY paces.\nMELS: It was late, I took a bus.\nRORY: No, you stole a bus.\nAMY: Who steals a BUS?\nMELS: I returned it.\nRORY: You drove it through the botanical garden.\nMELS: Shortcut.\nAMY: Why can't you just act like a person? Like a normal LEGAL person?\nMELS: I don't know, maybe I need a Doctor.\nAMY: (takes the TARDIS) Stop it!\nRORY: Er... I'd better go, I'm on earlies tomorrow. (packs schoolwork into bag and stands)\nMELS: It's all right for you. You've got Mr Perfect keeping you right.\nAMY: He's not even real. Just a stupid dream when I was a kid. (tosses the TARDIS to MELS)\nMELS: I wasn't talking about him. (looks at RORY as he opens the door)\nAMY: What, Rory? How have I GOT Rory?\nRORY: (stops at his name and turns) Yeah, how... how's she got me?\nAMY: He's not mine.\nRORY: No. No, I'm not hers.\nMELS: Oh, come on! Seriously, it's got to be you two. Oh, cut to the song, it's getting boring.\nAMY: Nice thought, OK? But completely impossible.\nRORY: (looks hurt) Yeah, impossible!\nAMY: I mean, I'd love to, he's gorgeous, he's my favourite guy, (pats him on the back) but he's, you know?\nRORY: A friend.\nAMY: Gay.\nRORY: (looks at AMY) I'm not gay.\nAMY: Yes, you are.\nRORY: No. No, I'm not.\nAMY: Course you are, don't be stupid!\nMELS watches from the bed, amused.\nAMY: In the time I've known you, when've you shown the slightest interest in a GIRL?\nMELS: (softly) Penny in the air!\nAMY: I've known you for, what, 10 years? I've seen you practically every day. Name one girl you've paid the SLIGHTEST bit of attention to?\nRORY can't answer and runs from the room.\nAMY: (realizes) Oh, my God! Rory! (runs after him)\nMELS: And the penny drops! (gets up)\nAMY: (distant) Rory!\nMELS: Catch you later, Time Boy! (tosses the TARDIS into the air)\nEXT. DAY\nAbove the cornfield, the TARDIS spins out of control. There is a gunshot.\nDOCTOR: (V.O.) You've shot it!\nINT. TARDIS\nThe DOCTOR is staring at a bullet hole in the time-rotor casing. AMY, RORY are clinging to the console and MELs is hanging onto the railing.\nDOCTOR: You shot my TARDIS! You shot the console!\nMELS: It's your fault!\nDOCTOR: Argh! How's it my fault?!\nMELS: You said guns didn't work in this place. You said we're in a state of temporal grace.\nDOCTOR: (frantically works the controls)That was a clever lie, you idiot! Anyone could tell that was a clever lie!\nEXT. DAY\nThe TARDIS continues to spin out of control and AMY screams.\nEXT. REICH CHANCELLERY, BERLIN 1938, DAY\nThe imposing façade is adorned with a stylized eagle, wings outstretched, above a wreath inside which is a swastika. To either side of the main entrance are large, draping red banners bearing the black swastika within a white circle. A general, ZIMMERMAN, enters the building.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, CORRIDOR, DAY\nZIMMERMAN strides down the hall past a janitor mopping the floor. The JANITOR stops and turns his head slowly and we hear mechanical whirring.\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nWe see the OFFICER from the JANITOR'S POV as seen through a viewscreen. A computer scans him. The Captain, CARTER, watches.\nCARTER: OK, we like him.\nA female crewmember, ANITA listens to her headset.\nANITA: Costume want to know about the suit.\nCARTER: Colour, shape, nothing detachable.\nAnother crewmember, JIM, enters the bridge and heads to his station.\nJIM: Musculature good to go.\nCARTER: That was quick.\nJIM: Showing off. Art department want to talk skin tone.\nAn older woman, HARRIET, enters the bridge.\nHARRIET: Yes, I do. I don't trust sensors, I want to take a look myself.\nJIM: We're in a hurry, we're not trying to win an award.\nHARRIET: That's what you said when we made Rasputin green!\nCARTER: OK, get your fat one up there. Run!\nHARRIET: Yes, Captain. (leaves)\nCARTER: (sits in command chair) Harriet's going to eyeball. Everyone else, good to go, please!\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, ZIMMERMAN'S OFFICE, DAY\nZIMMERMAN is standing at his file cabinet looking through a file as the door opens and the JANITOR enters and closes the door behind him.\nZIMMERMAN: What do you want?\nThe JANITOR walks forward until he is face-to-face with ZIMMERMAN.\nZIMMERMAN: What are you doing?\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nANITA: Musculature on line.\nJIM: Five foot 11, confirmed.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, ZIMMERMAN'S OFFICE, DAY\nThe JANITOR grows until he is the same height as ZIMMERMAN. ZIMMERMAN stares, stunned.\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nCARTER reaches up and grabs a microphone.\nCARTER: Harriet, are you up there yet?\nINT. SHIP, LIFT, DAY\nHARRIET stands in the lift. Just as the doors are about to open, the light on her wristlet changes from green to red and alarms begin to sound. The doors slide open.\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Welcome. You are unauthorised. Your death will now be implemented.\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nCARTER: Harriet, have you updated your privileges?\nINT. SHIP, LIFT, DAY\nHARRIET: Yes, of course I have! (presses buttons on wristlet until the light changes back to green) Look, I'm staff, see? Look, staff!\nAUTOMATED VOICE: You are authorised. Your existence will continue.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, ZIMMERMAN'S OFFICE, DAY\nZIMMERMAN: I don't understand.\nThe JANITOR'S clothes change to ZIMMERMAN'S uniform like scales flipping over all the way down his body.\nINT. SHIP, CORRIDOR, DAY\nHARRIET runs along the hallway.\nCARTER: (over radio) Harriet, shift!\nHARRIET: (into radio) Five seconds to eyeball.\nHARRIET reaches the end of the corridor and opens an iris by pressing her hand on a panel. She looks out.\nHARRIET: Shades 44 to 89, peaking at 60. Standard density. He's sweating a bit, so compensate.\nThe camera pulls out and we see that HARRIET is literally looking out of the JANITOR'S eye.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, ZIMMERMAN'S OFFICE, DAY\nZIMMERMAN: Wh-What are you?\nINT. SHIP, CORRIDOR, DAY\nThe iris closes behind HARRIET and we see her walk slowly back. There are a number of corridors-which are more like enclosed catwalks-at different levels.\nCARTER: (over radio) All hands, prepare for tessellation. Prepare for tessellation.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, ZIMMERMAN'S OFFICE, DAY\nThe JANITOR'S face changes to a duplicate of ZIMMERMAN. ZIMMERMAN gasps and falls back against the cabinet. The duplicate reaches out a hand and takes his glasses putting them on its own face.\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nCARTER: OK, clean up.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, ZIMMERMAN'S OFFICE, DAY\nA beam of light shoots out from the duplicate's right eye, miniaturizing ZIMMERMAN.\nINT. SHIP, CORRIDOR, DAY\nZIMMERMAN falls to the floor just inside the iris.\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nThe crew watches ZIMMERMAN on a monitor.\nCARTER: Who is he?\nANITA: Eric Zimmerman. Loyal member of the Nazi Party, guilty of Category Three hate crimes.\nCARTER: Well, then. Leave him to the Antibodies.\nINT. SHIP, CORRIDOR, DAY\nZIMMERMAN stands. His vision is blurry without his glasses. He slowly walks forward. There is an electronic buzzing as something rises from the floor behind him. ZIMMERMAN slowly turns around and sees what looks like a metallic jellyfish complete with dangling tentacles floating towards him. It is an ANTIBODY.\nANTIBODY: Welcome. You are unauthorised. Your death will now be implemented.\nZIMMERMAN runs and is confronted by another ANTIBODY.\nANTIBODY: Welcome. You will experience a tingling sensation and then death.\nZIMMERMAN tries another corridor.\nANTIBODY: Remain calm while your life is extracted.\nZIMMERMAN screams as the tentacles reach out for him and he disappears.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, OFFICE, DAY\nThe DUPLICATE ZIMMERMAN enters a large wood-panelled office and shuts the door. We only see the man at the desk from behind.\nMAN: What do you want? Who let you in here?\nThe DUPLICATE walks forward.\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nInside, everything shakes and CARTER'S mug falls to the floor.\nCARTER: What's wrong with the shock absorbers?\nJIM: Problem in the knees.\nCARTER: Let's hope we don't have to run.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, OFFICE, DAY\nDUPLICATE: Do not call for help. This room has been sound screened. You have been found guilty. Justice mode activating.\nThe DUPLICATE opens his mouth and a beam of light wraps the man at the desk who cries out in pain.\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nJIM: Hang on! This is 1938. We're too early, we need to go later in his time stream.\nANITA: Something else! We've got incoming!\nCARTER: On screen!\nINT.

SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nSparks fly as they reel from being knocked over by the TARDIS.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, OFFICE, DAY\nThe TARDIS bursts through the window, knocking the duplicate to the floor. The DOCTOR exits the TARDIS followed by RORY, AMY and MELS. All are coughing from the smoke.\nDOCTOR: Out, out, out! Everybody out. Don't breathe the smoke, just get out!\nAMY: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: A room.\nRORY: What room?\nDOCTOR: I don't know! I haven't memorized every room in the universe. I had yesterday off. (sees MELS standing at the open TARDIS door) Mels, don't go in there! (takes her gun)\nMELS: Oi!\nDOCTOR: Bad smoke! Don't breathe the bad, bad, smoke. Bad, deadly smoke, because somebody shot my TARDIS!\nRORY: (sees the DUPLICATE on the floor) Doctor, this guy, I think he's hurt.\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nCARTER: Transmit normal life signs!\nJIM: Artificial gravity holding. We should get upright when we can.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, OFFICE, DAY\nRORY: No, hang on. No, he's... he's fine.\nThe DOCTOR doesn't know what to do with the gun. He finally puts in in a fruit bowl on the desk. The MAN who was attacked climbs up from behind the desk.\nDOCTOR: Ooh, hello! Sorry, is this your office? Had a sort of collision with my vehicle. Faults on both sides, let's say no more about...(the MAN turns around and the DOCTOR sees who it is) ...it.\nAMY and RORY come up beside the DOCTOR.\nAMY: Is that...? No, it can't be, Doctor?\nHITLER: Thank you. Whoever you are, I think you have just saved my life.\nDOCTOR: Believe me... it was an accident.\nHITLER: (sees the TARDIS) What is this thing? (walks to it)\nAMY: What did he mean we saved his life? We could not have saved Hitler.\nDOCTOR: You see? You see, time travel, it never goes to plan.\nHITLER: This box, what is it?\nDOCTOR: (walks toward HITLER) It's a police telephone box from London, England. That's right, Adolf, the British are coming!\nBehind the DOCTOR, the DUPLICATE stands.\nHITLER: No, stop him! (pulls his gun and fires at the DUPLICATE)\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nMore sparks as they suffer from the impact of bullets.\nCARTER: Damage report! Damage report!\nINT.

I'm fine.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, OFFICE, DAY\nDUPLICATE: I think he missed.\nHITLER: He was going to kill me.\nRORY: Shut up, Hitler!\nDOCTOR: Rory, take Hitler and put him in that cupboard over there now.

(shoves him into the cupboard)\nHITLER: Who are you?\nRORY closes the door. The DOCTOR studies the DUPLICATE.\nDOCTOR: Are you OK?\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nThey watch the DOCTOR on screen as he peers at the DUPLICATE'S face.\nANITA: Sir, what do we do now?\nJIM: Suggestion: we should go into surveillance mode.\nCARTER: Agreed. Let's faint.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, OFFICE, DAY\nDUPLICATE: Oh, I... (falls backwards in a faint)\nRORY: I think he just fainted.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that was a faint. A perfect faint.\nAMY: (notices MELS has a hand on her stomach) Mels?\nMELS: Hitler...\nDOCTOR: What about him?\nMELS: Lousy shot. (falls to the floor)\nAll three run over to MELS.\nAMY: Mels! Mels!\nDOCTOR: Rory!\nRORY: No, no, no! I've got to stop the bleeding!\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nJIM: Sir, that blue box... I've got a match. (the screen shows information about the TARDIS) We're trying to bag war criminals, we've got the biggest one ever right under our noses. Forget Hitler. We take this one down, the Justice Department will give us the rest of the year off.\nCARTER: Are you sure?\nJIM: There's no question. (looks at CARTER) It's her.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, OFFICE, DAY\nAMY is stroking MELS' hair as RORY tries to stop the bleeding.\nAMY: How bad is it? Rory, what can we do?\nRORY: Just keep her conscious! Stay with us, Mels.\nDOCTOR: Hey, look at me. Just hold on.\nMELS: I used to dream about you. All those stories Amy told me.\nDOCTOR: What stories? Tell me what stories. Vampires in Venice, that's a belter.\nMELS: When I was little, I was going to marry you.\nDOCTOR: Good idea, let's get married. You live and I'll marry you, deal? Deal?\nMELS: Shouldn't you ask my parents permission?\nDOCTOR: Soon as you're well, I'll get on the phone.\nMELS: Might as well do it now, since they're both right here.\nThe DOCTOR, AMY and RORY exchange glances.\nMELS: Penny in the air.\nThe DOCTOR stands as MELS begins to glow with regeneration energy.\nMELS: Penny drops!\nRORY: What the hell's going on?\nDOCTOR: (grabs AMY and RORY, pulling them away) Back! Back! Back! Get back!\nMELS: (stands) Last time I did this, I ended up a toddler in the middle of New York.\nThe DOCTOR, AMY and RORY are standing against the desk.\nAMY: OK, Doctor, explain what is happening? Please!\nDOCTOR: Mels. Short for..?\nMELS: Melody.\nAMY: Yeah, I named my daughter after her.\nDOCTOR: You named your daughter... after your daughter.\nMELS: Took me years to find you two. I'm so glad I did. And, you see, it all worked out in the end, didn't it? You got to raise me after all.\nAMY: You're Melody?\nRORY: But if she's Melody, that means she's also...\nMELS: Oh, shut up, Dad! I'm focussing on a dress size.\nMELS gives in to the regeneration and screams as the change takes place. When it is over, she is in the now-familiar form of RIVER SONG-though she doesn't know it. She pants as she regains her breathing and becomes familiar with her new body.\nMELODY: Right, let's see, then. Ooh, it's all going on down there, isn't it? The hair! (runs to a mirror) Oh! The hair, it just doesn't stop, does it? Look at that! Everything changes! Oh, but I love it, I love it!(faces the others) I'm all sort of... mature! (puts her foot on a piece of furniture, attempting to look seductive) Hello, Benjamin!\nDOCTOR: (covers his eyes briefly)(to AMY) Who's Benjamin?\nMELODY: The teeth!(looks back in the mirror) The teeth, the teeth! (runs to the others) Oh, look at them! (forces herself on the DOCTOR) Watch out! That bow tie! Excuse me, you lot, I need to weigh myself! (runs to the restroom)\nThe DOCTOR, AMY and RORY sit on the edge of the desk, stunned.\nAMY: That's Melody?\nRORY: That's River Song.\nMELODY stands in the doorway.\nMELODY: Who's River Song?\nThey turn to look at her.\nDOCTOR: Spoilers.\nMELODY: Spoilers? What's spoilers? Hang on, just something I have to check! (runs back into the other room)\nRORY: Is anybody else finding today just a bit difficult? I'm getting a sort of banging in my head.\nAMY: Yeah, I think that's Hitler in the cupboard.\nRORY: That's not helping.\nThe DOCTOR stands and walks across the room. AMY and RORY join him.\nDOCTOR: This isn't the River Song we know yet. This is her right at the start. Doesn't even know her name.\nMELODY: (O.C.) Ah, that's magnificent!\nThey turn to see her leaning with her hand against the door jamb\nMELODY: I'm going to wear LOTS of jodhpurs!\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nCARTER: That's her, all right. Melody Pond...the woman who kills the Doctor.\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, OFFICE, DAY\nMELODY: Well, now, enough of all that! (pulls a gun and aims It at the DOCTOR) Down to business.\nDOCTOR: Oh, hello. I thought we were getting married.\nMELODY: (walks towards them) I told you, I'm not a wedding person.\nRORY: Doctor, what's she doing?\nDOCTOR: What she's programmed to.\nRORY: Where'd she get the gun?\nDOCTOR: Hello, Benjamin.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nWe flash back to MELODY standing by the chair when she said \"Hello, Benjamin\". She reaches back and takes the gun from the seat of the chair.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMELODY: You noticed!\nMELODY fires but the chambers are empty.\nDOCTOR: Of course I noticed.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nWhile MELS is regenerating, the DOCTOR \"falls\" by the chair, sees the gun and removes the bullets.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: (walks forward) As soon as I knew you were coming, I tidied up a bit.\nMELODY: (tosses the gun away) I know you did.(reaches into her vest)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nWhen MELODY pressed herself against the DOCTOR, she took the gun from the fruit bowl.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: I know you know.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe DOCTOR spins the fruit bowl around so MELODY actually grabs a banana.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMELODY pulls out the banana thinking it's a gun.\nMELODY: Goodness, is killing you going to take all day?\nDOCTOR: Why? (takes the banana) Are you busy?\nMELODY: Oh, I'm not complaining.\nMELODY takes the letter opener from HITLER'S desk and swipes at the DOCTOR. The DOCTOR uses the sonic to make her drop it.\nDOCTOR: If you were in a hurry, you could've killed me in the cornfield.\nMELODY: We'd only just met. I'm a psychopath. I'm not rude.\nMELODY takes the gun from the fruit bowl and fires. The DOCTOR holds up the clip and blows on it.\nAMY: You were not a psychopath! Why would she be a psychopath?\nMELODY and the DOCTOR circle each other.\nMELODY: Oh, Mummy, Mummy, pay attention. I was trained and conditioned for one purpose. I was born to kill the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Demons Run, remember? This is what they were building, my bespoke psychopath.\nMELODY and the DOCTOR end up face-to-face.\nMELODY: I'm all yours, sweetie. (kisses him)\nDOCTOR: Only River Song gets to call me that.\nMELODY: And who is River Song?\nDOCTOR: An old friend of mine.\nMELODY: Stupid name.\nMELODY walks to the window.\nMELODY: Oh, look at that! (steps onto the sill) Berlin on the eve of war. A whole world about to tear itself apart. (turns back) Now that's my kind of town. Mum, Dad, don't follow me. And, yes, that is a warning.\nDOCTOR: No warning for me, then?\nMELODY: No need, my love. The deed is done and so are you.\nThe DOCTOR'S legs wobble and RORY and AMY hold him up. He grips his chest in pain.\nAMY: Doctor, what's wrong?\nDOCTOR: What have you done? River!\nMELODY: Oh, River, River, River! More than a friend, I think.\nDOCTOR: What have you done?!(collapses)\nMELODY: It was never going to be a gun for you, Doctor, the man of peace who understands every kind of warfare, except, perhaps, the cruellest.\nThe DOCTOR rubs a finger against his lips and recalls the kiss.\nMELODY: Kiss, kiss.(blows a kiss and jumps outside)\nRORY: What's wrong with you? What's she done to you?\nDOCTOR: Poisoned me... but I'm fine. Well, no, I'm dying, but I've got a plan.\nAMY: What plan?\nThe DOCTOR, AMY and RORY are standing against the desk.\nDOCTOR: (groans) I'm not dying. See, fine!\nINT. SHIP, BRIDGE, DAY\nANITA: Scanning him. He's dying all right.\nJIM: But he can't be.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. REICH CHANCELLERY, OFFICE, DAY\nThe DOCTOR groans as AMY and RORY help him stand.\nRORY: OK, what do we do? How do we help you?\nDOCTOR: Take this! The TARDIS can home in on it.

RORY watches from his hiding place.\nRORY: No!\nThe soldiers fire. The camera switches from RORY back to MELODY who is hugging herself. She lifts her head and smiles.\nMELODY: Tip for you all...never shoot a girl while she's regenerating.\nMELODY uses regeneration energy on the soldiers, throwing them backwards and knocking them unconscious. She laughs.\nMELODY: Ah!

You will be dead in 32 minutes.\nDOCTOR: Unless I'm cured, yeah?\nINTERFACE: There is no cure. You will be dead in 32 minutes.\nDOCTOR: Why do you keep saying that?\nINTERFACE: Because you will be dead in 32 minutes.\nDOCTOR: You see, there you go again. Basically skipping 31 whole minutes when I'm absolutely fine. Scottish, that's all I'm saying.\nINTERFACE: You will be fine for 31 minutes. You will be dead in 32 minutes.\nDOCTOR: Scotland's never conquered anywhere. Not even a Shetland. River needs me. She's only just beginning, I can't die now.\nINTERFACE: You will not die now.

The door behind AMY and RORY slides open and JIM is there. He slips the green light devices on their wrists.\nJIM: It's OK. Stay still and don't move. Privileges activated. See? Activated. (holds their arms up for the ANTIBODIES to see)\nANTIBODY: You are authorised. Your existence will continue. (leave)\nJIM: You can put your hands down. This is Justice Department Vehicle 6018.

(removes cap)\nTESELECTA AMY moves around to face MELODY.\nTESELECTA AMY: You killed the Doctor on the orders of the movement known as the Silence and Academy of the Question. You accept and know this to be true?\nMELODY: Quite honestly, I don't really remember. It was all a bit of jumble.\nTESELECTA AMY pushes the mirror out of the way and opens its mouth. A beam envelopes MELODY and she cries out.\nMELODY: No! No! Get off me!\nDOCTOR: Sorry, did you say she killed the Doctor?\nTESELECTA AMY closes its mouth and faces the DOCTOR who is leaning against the TARDIS on the dais.

Do not harm her in any way.\nThe TESELECTA closes its mouth. MELODY is caught in a containment field.\nINT. TESELECTA, BRIDGE, DAY\nCARTER speaks into a microphone by his chair that controls the TESELECTA'S voice. It sounds like AMY is speaking as well.\nCARTER: Why would you care? She is the women who kills you.\nINT. RESTAURANT, DAY\nThe DOCTOR removes his top hat.\nDOCTOR: I'm not dead.\nTESELECTA AMY: You're dying.\nDOCTOR: Well, at least I'm not a time-travelling shape-shifting robot operated by miniaturized cross people, which, I have got to admit, I didn't see coming. (points his cane at MELODY) What do you want with her?\nTESELECTA AMY: She's Melody Pond.\nINT. TESELECTA, BRIDGE, DAY\nCARTER: (into microphone) According to records, the woman who kills the Doctor.\nINT. RESTAURANT, DAY\nDOCTOR: And I'm the Doctor, what's it to you?\nINT. TESELECTA, BRIDGE, DAY\nCARTER: (into microphone) (stands) Throughout history, many criminals have gone unpunished in their lifetimes. Time travel has... responsibilities.\nINT. RESTAURANT, DAY\nThe DOCTOR laughs.\nDOCTOR: What? You got yourselves time travel, so you decided to punish dead people?\nINT. TESELECTA, BRIDGE, DAY\nCARTER: (into microphone) We don't kill them.

I'm dying... who wants me dead?\nTESELECTA AMY: The Silence.\nDOCTOR: What is the Silence? Why is it called that? What does it mean?\nTESELECTA AMY: The Silence is not a species. It is a religious order, or movement. Their core belief is that silence will fall when the question is asked.\nDOCTOR: What question?\nTESELECTA AMY: The first question. The oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but what is the question?\nTESELECTA AMY: Unknown.\nDOCTOR: Well, fat lot of use that is, you big ginge!

TESELECTA, BRIDGE, DAY\nAMY flashes on the devices and how the green light saved them from the ANTIBODIES.\nAMY sees that everyone is wearing the devices and there is an ANTIBODY resting in a console. She pulls out the sonic.\nRORY: What are you doing?\nAMY: Pointing and thinking. Get ready to run.\nAMY uses the sonic on her device and it turns red. An alarm sounds and the ANTIBODY rises.\nANTIBODY: You are unauthorised.

You still care.\nTESELECTA AMY: Doctor! Help! Doctor, help us! Please help us.\nMELODY: It's impressive, I'll give you that.\nDOCTOR: River, please...\nMELODY: (stands) Again? Who is this River?

They stop when they see MELODY appear from the other side of the console.\nMELODY: I seem to be able to fly her. She showed me how, she taught me. The Doctor says I'm the child of the TARDIS. What does he mean?\nAMY: Where is he?\nINT. RESTAURANT, DAY\nThe DOCTOR is lying on his back on the stairs. AMY and RORY kneel beside him. AMY holds his hand in hers.\nAMY: You can't die now.

She slowly walks to the DOCTOR and kneels beside him.\nDOCTOR: Find her. Find River Song and tell her something from me.\nMELODY: Tell her what?\nThe DOCTOR tugs on her jacket and MELODY bends over so he can whisper in her ear.\nMELODY: Well, I'm sure she knows.\nMELDOY lifts her head and sees the DOCTOR is unconscious.

The Doctor, is he worth it?\nAMY: Yes. Yes, he is.\nMELODY puts a hand to either side of the DOCTOR'S face. He inhales sharply and opens his eyes.\nDOCTOR: (whispers) River? No!

HOSPITAL ROOM, DAY\nRORY and AMY bend over the bed and slowly come into focus.\nAMY: Hey.\nMELODY: Hey. Where am I?\nAMY: You're safe now.

TARDIS\nAMY: So that's it? We leave her there?\nDOCTOR: Sisters of the Infinite Schism, greatest hospital in the universe.\nAMY: Yeah, but she's our daughter. Doctor, she's River and she's our daughter.\nDOCTOR: Amy, I know. But we have to let her make her own way now. We have too much foreknowledge. (looks at the monitor and sees the time and place of his death) Dangerous thing, foreknowledge.\nAMY: What's that?\nDOCTOR: (turns off monitor) Nothing. Just some data from the Teselecta. Very boring.\nRORY: Doctor, River was brainwashed to kill you?\nDOCTOR: Well, she did, and then used her remaining lives to bring me back. As first dates go, I'd say that was mixed signals.\nRORY: But that stuff that they put in her head, is that gone now? The River that we know in the future, she is in prison for murder.\nAMY: Whose murder?\nThe DOCTOR is quiet and then smiles. RORY is upset that he doesn't get an answer.\nAMY: Will we see her again?\nDOCTOR: Oh, she'll come looking for us.(runs up stairs)\nAMY: Yeah, but how? How do people even look for you?\nDOCTOR: Oh, Pond! Haven't you figured that one out yet?\nINT.

I spend the day obsessing over why it didn't work and what I could've done differently.\n(scene changes)\n(inside jeep, Lorelai is driving, Rory sitting in passenger seat.)\nL : I'm analyzing all my shortcomings when all I really need to be doing is vowing to never ever make a plan ever again which I'm doing now. Having, once again, been the innocent victim of my own stupid plans.\n(they go past her old school and Rory looks out at all the kids having fun.)\nL : God, I need some coffee. (sighs)\n(screen shows Jeep driving down several different roads, and then a road sign that says Hartford, 14 miles.)\n(screen switches to show different gargoyles, and then the outside of Chilton.)\n(Rory and Lorelai sit in Jeep, peering out at Chilton.)\nR : I remember it being smaller. (she looks worried)\nL : Yeah. And less.. (she looks intimidated)\nR : Off with their heads.\nL : Ah. (tilts her head, peering up.)\nR: (glancing at her mom, does the same.) What are you looking at?\nL : I'm just trying to see if there's a hunchback up in that bell tower.\nR : So, how do I look?\nL : (sighs, sits back and beams with motherly pride.) You look great.\nR : Really? (skeptical)\nL : Really. You are an amazing kid. You have earned this. You just go in there and show them what smart really is. I love you. Call me if you need me. (reaches for gear)\nR: (looks worried) You're kidding, right?\nL : No! Call me if you need anything. I'm great at making up dirty cheers.\nR : You have to go in with me.\nL : Rory, come on. (looks at her clothes meaningfully.)\nR : You have to meet the headmaster.\nL : Well, look at me! I can't meet anyone who does anything in there. I look like that chick from the 'Dukes of Hazzard'.\nR : This is my first day. You are not getting out of going in there with me.\n(Rory and Lorelai get out of the jeep. Two moms walking by stare at Lorelai, who drops her coat. They scurry away.)\nL : Good morning!\nL : (to Rory) Oh, well, we're gonna be best friends.\n(Lorelai puts her coat on as they walk into the Chilton courtyard.)\nL : So, where do we go.\nR : (looks at paper in her hand) Uh, the Ambroise building.\nL : Which is?\nR : The big, scary one.\nL : Oh great! Thanks for the input.\n(man walking by looks over at them, especially with some interest to Lorelai.)\n(they look around, slightly bewildered)\nMan : lost?\nL : Oh, yeah. We're looking for the headmaster's office in the Ambroise building.\nMan : Ah, okay. Well, this is it right here. (he points beside them) Down the stairs, make a left and the headmaster's office is at the end of the hall.\nL : Great. Thank you.\nMan : You're welcome.\n(Rory grabs Lorelai's arm to go, but the man extends a hand.)\nMan : Uh, I'm Ian Jack. My daughter Julia goes to school here. (they shake hands)\nL : Hi! I'm Lorelai Gilmore. This is my daughter, Rory. (Rory looks slightly uncomfortable.)\nIan : Your daughter? Really. (surprised) Wow, that's great. Uh I mean, daughters are a great thing.\nL : We're big fans. (they're flirting)\nIan : (laughing) Yeah. So, is your husband here? I'd love to meet him.\nL : Um, no. I'm not married. I'd love to meet your wife, though.\nIan : I'm divorced.\nL : Shame.\nR : Excuse me. I really got to..\nL : (grabs Rory's arm) Right! We gotta go meet the big guy, and I gotta get back to work.\n(they rush off)\nIan : (calls) Where do you work?\nL : (rushes back) At an inn. The Independence Inn. I run it.\nIan : Really?\nL : In a different outfit, of course.\nIan : Ha. Well, It was nice to meet you, Lorelai. Good luck in school, Rory. I'll tell Julia to look out for you.\nR : Great, thanks.\nIan : See you.\n(Lorelai waves a little, smiles, mouths 'bye'.)\nL : What a nice, nice man.\nR : You're feeling pretty good about yourself right now, aren't you.\nL : Yeah (still smiling)\nR : Do you want me to get you a mirror?\nL : I'm back. Let's go. (smile is gone, they rush off)\n(scene changes)\n(Lorelai and Rory are walking down the stairs in Chilton. They look around.)\nL : Oh, good. More big stuff. (sarcastically)\nR : Turn left.\nL : Oh\n(Rory and Lorelai walk out of the screen. The camera is on three sour looking girls, staring after them. They roll their eyes, look expressively at one another, and continue on their way.)\n(screen changes)\n(Lorelai and Rory are walking down a hallway, almost to the headmaster's office. They look at their surroundings with apprehension. They get to the door and stand in front of it, just staring.)\nL : You ready?\nR : No.\nL : You ready?\nR : Yes.\n(They open the doors, and step into a room that contains a desk with a strict looking woman wearing library glasses sitting at it. They stop in front of her.)\nL : (clears throat) Um.. Excuse me. (Secretary looks up suddenly. She jumps back slightly.) Oh! How.. Wow. Hi. I.. I'm Lorelai Gilmore. This is my daughter, Lorelai Gilmore. I named her after me. I was in the hospital all whacked out on Demerol. (glances at Rory, realizes she's rambling.) Never mind. B-B-But we call her 'Rory'. It's short for Lorelai or even 'Hey, you' depending on the.. (Rory nudges her) Is the headmaster here?\nSecretary : (gets up, removes her glasses) One moment. (Walks briskly away.)\n(The Gilmores watch her until she closes the door.)\nL : (whispering) See, that's what happens when you go to bed with your makeup on.\n(Rory grins, Lorelai sighs)\n(Door opens behind them, Secretary stands there stiffly, as if announcing a guest.)\nSecretary : Headmaster Charleston will see you now.\nL : (clears throat) Great. Thanks.\n(They walk into room, secretary shuts door.)\nHeadmaster : (extending hand) Ms. Gilmore, I'm headmaster Charleston.\nL : Hi. Wow. It's really nice to meet.. (looks around, looks again at corner, sees her mother on couch) Mom. Uh, ex.. What are you doing here?\nGrandmother : (sweeps past Lorelai) I came to wish my granddaughter luck on her first day of school. (Lorelai looks exasperated) Rory, you look wonderful in that uniform!\nL : You didn't have to come all the way out here, Mom.\nGrandmother : This gave me a chance to make sure that Hanlin here takes good care of Rory.\nL : (gestures to Headmaster) You're Hanlin.\nHeadmaster : Hanlin Charleston.\nGrandmother : Hanlin's wife and I are on the symphony fundraising committee together.\nL : Wow. That's great.\nHeadmaster : Your father and I are golf rivals. We're still fighting it out to see which one is worse.\nGrandmother : Oh, yes. We're all old friends.\nL : Well, there's nothing like friends. Especially if they're old.\n(Everyone looks a tad oddly around at her remark.)\nHeadmaster : Would you like to take off your coat and have a seat?\nL : (looks frightened) Oh, no. No, I'm fine.\nHeadmaster : I'm afraid they were a little overzealous with the furnace this morning. It's quite warm in here.\nL : I like it warm. (nodding her head like an idiot)\nGrandmother : Lorelai, take off your coat and sit down. You don't want Hanlin to think you're rude. (commanding tone of voice)\nL : (looking extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed, takes off coat. Everyone stares, grandmother rolls her eyes. Exhales loudly.) Laundry day.\nGrandmother : Hanlin, did you know that Rory has a 4.0 grade point average?\nL : I'm sure he does, Mom.\nGrandmother : This is a very special girl. You take good care of her.\nHeadmaster : We'll do our best, Emily.\n(everyone sits down)\nL : Rory's not going to be a problem. She's totally low maintenance. You know, like a Honda. You know, they're just easy, just.. (Rory looks embarrassed) Nice office.\nGrandmother : Well, I don't think we should take up anymore of your precious time. It was lovely to see you. Give Bitty our love. (kisses cheeks with headmaster)\nHeadmaster : Tell Richard I'll see him at the club Sunday.\nGrandmother : Have a wonderful day, Rory. I want to hear all about it. Do you need a ride or is your horse parked outside? (to Lorelai) (walks out of room)\nL : It's so nice to meet you. (shakes hands with headmaster, kisses Rory's forehead.) Have a great day.\nHeadmaster : Oh, you don't want to forget your coat.\nL : (turns) Oh no, 'cause that would be embarrassing. (laughs, walks out of office.)\n(scene changes)\n(Lorelai and Grandmother are walking down the hall.)\nGrandmother : How do you leave the house looking like that? What kind of an impression did you think you were gonna make?\nL : (sighs) What are you doing here, mother?\nGrandmother : I told you, I came to put in a good word for Rory.\nL : She didn't need a good word.\nGrandmother : I'm not allowed here, is that it?\nL : I didn't say that.\nGrandmother : I'm allowed to pay for it. But I can't actually set foot on the premises. I just want to get the rules straight. How about the street. Can I drive down the street? Maybe I should just avoid the neighborhood altogether. Although my doctor is right down the block. Maybe I can get special permission if I'm bleeding.\nL : (looking incredibly annoyed, her patience is wearing thin.) I'm sorry. I was just surprised to see you here.\nGrandmother : I thought it was important for this school to know they had a Gilmore amongst them.\nL : A very good thought.\nGrandmother : And that some of the Gilmores actually own clothing.\nL : And on that note, I have to get to work. I'll see you later.\nGrandmother : Dinner, Friday night. No spurs, please.\n(Lorelai walks away, thrusts out her arms in annoyance.)\n(Commercials)\n(Shows opening shot of the outside of Chilton.)\n(Headmaster and Rory are sitting in his office.)\nHeadmaster : You're obviously a bright girl, Miss. Gilmore.\nRory : Thank you.\nHeadmaster : Good grades. Teachers like you. Not a lot of social activities, though.\nRory : Oh, well, just living at Stars Hollow is kind of a social activity, actually.\nHeadmaster : Nothing in your school appealed to you?\nRory : I work at my mother's inn after school sometimes. And I was in the German Club for a while. But there were only three of us. Then two left after seeing \"Schindler's List\".\nHeadmaster : What are your aspirations?\nRory : I want to go to Harvard to study Journalism and Political Science.\nHeadmaster : On your way to being\nRory : Christiane Amanpour.\nHeadmaster : Really?\nRory : Yes.\nHeadmaster : Not Cokie Roberts?\nRory : No.\nHeadmaster : Not Oprah, Rosie, or one of the women from 'The View'?\nRory : No.\nHeadmaster : Why do you wish to be Christiane Amanpour?\nRory : I don't wish to be her, exactly. I just want to do what she does.\nHeadmaster : Which is?\nRory : Travel, see the world up close, report on what's really going on, and to be part of something big.\nHeadmaster : And to be a part of something big you have to be on TV? Why not lead the police on a high speed chase, it's a quicker way to achieve this goal.\nRory : Being on TV has nothing to do with it. Maybe I'll be a Journalist and write books or articles about what I see. I just want to be sure that I see something. (Headmaster looks at papers.) You'll notice the debating teams also missing from my resume.\nHeadmaster : (nods and stands up) I've known your Grandparents for quite some time.\nRory : I know.\nHeadmaster : In fact, I was at a party at their house just last week where I had the most delicious lobster puffs I've ever eaten. I'm very fond of them.\nRory : That's nice.\n(Headmaster sits down across from her.)\nHeadmaster : None of this, however, will be of any benefit to you. Chilton has one of the highest academic standards of any school in America. You may have been the smartest girl at Stars Hollow, but this is a different place. The pressures are greater, the rules are stricter, and the expectations are high. If you make it through, you will have received one of the finest educations one can get. And there should be no reason why you should not achieve all your goals. However, since you are starting late, and are not used to this highly competitive atmosphere, there is a good chance that you will fail. That is fine. Failure is a part of life. But not a part of Chilton. Understand?\nR : (looking more and more unsure of herself.) So, you liked the lobster puffs, huh.\nHeadmaster : Take this to Miss. James in the administration office across the hall.\n(he hands her the folder, she takes it and leaves the room, he puts on his glasses.)\n(scene changes)\n(Rory walks into the administration office, she goes up to the desk and puts down the folder.)\nR : Hi, I'm looking for Miss James?\nMiss James : Name?\nR : Lorelai Gilmore. But I go by Rory.\nMiss James : Fill this out, please.\n(Miss James takes the folder and gives Rory a sheet and a pencil. Miss James puts down the folder on a desk to the side. The girl at the desk looks around and stealthily takes the folder and gives it to somebody out the window.)\n(scene changes)\n(It is in the bushes, outside the window. There are three girls there, the same ones that stared at Rory on the stairs.)\nGirl 1 : Well?\nGirl 2 : Shut up.\nGirl 3 : Hurry. Please. Spiders.\nGirl 2 : Lorelai Gilmore.\nGirl 1 : Nice stripper name.\nGirl 2 : Formerly of Stars Hollow High School.\nGirl 1 : Where's that?\nGirl 2 : Make a left at the haystacks and follow the cows. Perfect attendance, 4.0 grade point average.\nGirl 3 : Bugs, dirt, twigs.\nGirl 2 : She's a Journalism major.\nGirl 1 : That means she's going out for the school paper.\nGirl 2 : Not necessarily. She's got a thousand recommendations in here. Popular with the adults.\nGirl 1 : And going out for the school paper.\nGirl 2 : You don't know she's going out for the paper. She'll never catch up. She's a month behind.\nGirl 1 : You can tutor her. Be like a big sister.\nGirl 2 : You're funny.\nGirl 3 : Okay, lizard, goodbye.\nGirl 2 : Why are they letting all these extra people in? They just take up space and screw up the curve. We don't need any new kids here.\nGirl 1 : Too late.\n(Girl 2 says psst out the window, someone takes the folder.)\n(scene changes)\n(back in the office, Miss James is giving stuff to Rory.)\nMiss James : Here's your locker number, here's your schedule. Here's the rules of the school and the Chilton code of honor. Here are the words to the school song, which must be recited upon demand. This an happen anytime, anyplace. If you do it in Latin you get extra credit. Do you have any questions?\nR : Uh, not at the moment.\nMiss James : If you do, you can make an appointment with your guidance counselor, Mr. Winters. He handles everything but Bulimia and pregnancy. For that, you have to go to the nurse, or Coach Rubens. Welcome to Chilton.\n(scene changes)\n(Lorelai is walking down the road by Luke's diner with her dry cleaning. She goes into the door and passes a man on his way out, smiling at him.)\nL : (sighs) I already had the longest day of my life and it's only ten o'clock.\nLuke : (fixing what looks like a toaster) There's no coffee.\nL : That's not funny.\nLuke : I can give you herbal tea.\nL : This is not an herbal tea morning. This is a coffee morning.\nLuke : Every morning for you is a coffee morning.\nL : This is a jumbo coffee morning. I need coffee in an IV.\nLuke : I can give you tea and a balance bar.\nL : Please, please, please tell me you're kidding.\nLuke : I'm kidding. (goes back and gets the coffee pot.)\nL : You're sick.\nLuke : Yep.\nL : You're a fiend!\nLuke : For here or to go.\nL : To go please.\nLuke : You want to know what this stuff does to your nervous system?\nL : Do you have a chart? Because I love charts.\nLuke : Maybe next time. What happened this morning that was so awful.\nL : Rory started Chilton.\nLuke : Really?\nL : Yeah. (sees him looking at her strangely) What?\nLuke : That's how you dressed to take Rory to Chilton? That's a fancy school.\nL : My clothes were at the cleaners. I had the fuzzy clock and it didn't purr on time.\nLuke : It didn't purr?\nL : It's fuzzy. It purrs. Never mind. I gotta go. I had a plan, damn it.\nLuke : Me too. Next time you're getting tea.\n(Lorelai stalks out of the diner. Luke pulls what looks like a chicken bone out of the toaster.)\n(scene changes)\n(Miss Patty is standing next to the street and lots of little girls in pink outfits are twirling batons.)\nMiss Patty : Visualize, Ladies. It's thanksgiving day parade. You're standing on fifth avenue. There's 100 beautiful boys marching in place behind you. And there you are. You are out in front with your fabulous legs and your perfect tush. Your baton is on fire and the crowd goes nuts! Okay, cookie time. (looks around and sees Lorelai walking down the street) Lorelai, hi.\nL : Hi, Patty.\nMiss Patty : Isn't today Rory's first day at Chilton?\nL : Oh, yeah, she's there now. I just got through dropping her off.\nMiss Patty : Is that what you wore?\nL : Oh, look at the time. See you, Patty.\nMiss Patty : Bye.\n(Lorelai walks around the jeep and gets in. Miss Patty walks back into the studio.)\nMiss Patty : Ladies, what do I see. Naked girls. No, no, keep those leotards on. This is not Brazil.\n(scene changes)\n(Jeep is pulling up to the Gilmore house. Lorelai gets out of the car somewhat uncoordinated with her coffee and her dry cleaning, dropping clothes everywhere. She staggers up to the house and goes in. The phone is ringing, she struggles to find the cordless. Finally finding it in a heap of junk and falling back down onto the couch.)\nL : Hello?\nGrandmother : Lorelai?\nL : Mom?\nGrandmother : I'm going shopping this afternoon and I'd thought I'd pick up a few things for Rory.\nL : Like what?\nGrandmother : A couple of extra skirts and tops for school.\nL : Ok, I already took care of that Mom. I got her two skirts and a bunch of tops.\nGrandmother : But there a five days in a school week.\nL : Are you sure? My days of the week underwear only go till Thursday. (is struggling to pull cowboy boots off.)\nGrandmother : Is that a joke?\nL : Two skirts are fine. Don't bother.\nGrandmother : What if she gets one dirty?\nL : Well, then, she'll wear the other one.\nGrandmother : What if she gets them both dirty?\nL : We'll use this newfangled thing called a washing machine. The town just chipped in and bought one. My turn's Tuesday.\nGrandmother : What about socks? Chilton has these special logo socks. Rory should have them. And what about the school sweater. She might want that. And there's a sweater vest and a bookbag.\nL : Are you getting a cut of the merchandise?\nGrandmother : Rory should have these things. She'll be the only one who doesn't.\nL : She'll have them.\nGrandmother : I'm at least getting her the Chilton coat. Is she a size 6?\nL : Mom, please.\nGrandmother : This is a simple question, Lorelai.\nL : She's a six, but I'd get a size eight in case she grows.\nGrandmother : If she grows, I'll buy another.\nL : Ok, well then, a six is great. I gotta go, Mom. Bye.\n(scene changes)\n(there is a classroom, with a teacher pacing in front lecturing)\nTeacher : And while French culture was the dominant outside cultural influence, especially for Russia's monied class, English culture also had it's impact. Tolstoy's favorite author, for instance, was..\nGirl 2 : (raises her hand briefly) Dickens.\nTeacher : Yes, and last week we discovered Dostoevski's main authorial influences.\nGirl 2 : (raises her hand again) George Sand and Balzac. (Rory looks at her slightly apprehensively.)\nTeacher : Good. As Tolstoy commenced writing both \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna Karenina\", Count Leo would turn to..\nGirl 2 : \"David Copperfield\"\nTeacher : Correct. He would turn to \"David Copperfield\" for inspiration.\n(door opens and cute guy walks in)\nTeacher : Ah, Mr. Dugray.\nGuy : Sir. (hands teacher note)\nTeacher : Nice to have you back. I hope your Grandfather's feeling better.\nGuy : Much better, sir.\nTeacher : Good. Take your seat please.\n(guy walks over to his seat, leering openly at Rory, making her uncomfortable)\nTeacher : \"Great Expectations\", \"A Tale of Two Cities\", \"Little Dorrit\", all major influences on Leo Tolstoy.\n(guy leans forward to talk to his friend in the seat in front of him)\nGuy 1 : Who's that?\nGuy 2 : New girl.\nTeachers : of these two literary masters, Tolstoy and Dickens. (bell rings) Class dismissed.\n(Girls 1, 2, and 3 are all looking over at Rory's notes and her with disdain, Rory tries to smile at them)\nGuy 1 : Looks like we got ourselves a Mary. (looking at Rory)\nTeacher : Miss, uh, Gilmore, could you come up here please? (she goes up to him) This is last week's study material. (he hands her a huge binder crammed full of papers) There'll be a test on them tomorrow. But since you're new, you can take a makeup test on Monday. Will that be sufficient time?\nR : Monday? Sure, that's fine. (looking overwhelmed)\nTeacher : That's just an overview. You'll find it very helpful to you to borrow one of the other student's personal notes. They tend to be more detailed.\nR : More detailed than this?\nTeacher : It seems daunting right now, I know.\nR : No, no. It's okay. I'll be fine. (moves to leave the room)\nTeacher : Remember to get those notes. They'll be a lifesaver.\n(scene changes)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Rory is coming out of the room and almost walks into Girl 2)\nGirl 2 : I'm Paris.\nR : I didn't see you there. Where'd you come from.\nParis : I know who you are, too. Lorelai Gilmore from Stars Hollow.\nR : You can call me Rory.\nParis : Are you going out for the 'Franklin'?\nR : The what?\nParis : Nice innocent act. At least I know you're not going out for drama club. The Franklin, the school paper, are you going out for it?\nR : I have to find my locker first.\nParis : I'm gonna be editor next year.\nR : Well, good for you. (tries to move away, but Paris steps in front of her)\nParis : I'm also the top of the class, and I intend to be valedictorian when I graduate.\nR : Okay. I'm going now.\nParis : You'll never catch up. You'll never beat me. This school is my domain and the Franklin is my domain. And don't you ever forget that. (she walks off)\nR : (looks after her strangely) I guess you're not going to let me borrow your notes, huh. (continues down hallway)\n(Commercials)\n(opening scene of the outside of the Independence Inn. Switches to kitchen where Sookie is smelling peaches with Fruit Man looking on)\nSookie : They're smaller than the last batch.\nFruit Man : No, they're not.\nSookie : Smaller means watery. No good peach taste.\nFruit Man : No, there's plenty of peach taste being as they're, you know, peaches.\nSookie : What about the ones on the bottom.\nFruit Man : Oh, great. Be sure to check them all. (sarcastically) That's it. Give every last one of them a nice good squeeze. You wouldn't actually want to leave me one that I could sell to somebody else. Wait a minute, you missed one. I'm not going to tell you which one it is. I'm just going to let your impeccably good radar (she picks up peach) There it is, you got it. (throws up hands)\n(Lorelai walks into kitchen)\nL : Okay, I look great, right?\nSookie : Yes.\nL : This is how I was supposed to look. Good morning Jackson (Fruit Man).\nSookie : This was Rory's first day.\nL : I was supposed to look fabulous, and not like I'd been up all night playing quarters.\nSookie : Nobody cares how you looked.\nL : Everybody cared.\nSookie : Who?\nL : The other moms, the Headmaster, my mom, Luke, Miss Patty, the new fire chief with the tiny head.\nSookie : (holds out a peach) Taste this.\nL : (bites peach) A little watery.\nJackson : Oh! Now, you planned this!\nSookie : Did you say something about your mother?\nL : I walked into the headmaster's office, and there she was.\nSookie : Really? Why?\nL : Because she knew I'd wake up late and humiliate myself.\nSookie : Wow, she's good.\nL : She's the best.\n(Sookie takes peach and rolls it along the floor.)\nJackson : Oh, I would love to know what you're doing.\nSookie : They're rolling differently, too. Because of the extra water.\nJackson : Makes perfect sense.\nSookie : I would ignore those women, cause the only thing that matters is that Rory got into that great school.\nL : She looked so amazing in her uniform. She was so excited. I just admire her so much jumping into a new school. She's my hero.\nSookie : Mine too!\nJackson : Oh, yeah. Sign me up. Sookie, the peaches, please. (exasperated)\n(Michel walks in)\nMichel : (French accent) Excuse me. There's a phone call for you. If I'm to fetch you like a dog, I'd like a cookie and a raise.\nL : Thanks for the peach. (hands the peach to Jackson, Sookie takes the peach, Lorelai walks out)\n(scene changes)\n(parlor at Inn, old women are looking at book and walking by, Lorelai walks by them with Michel trailing)\nWoman 1 : This would be absolutely wonderful. There are supposed to be darling shops all up and down this street. Oh, excuse me sir (to Michel). Can you tell me where we'd find the best antiques?\nMichel : At your house, I'd guess. (walks off, women are dismayed)\nL : Mom, did I give you this number? Because I don't remember giving you this number. Yeah, well, I must be losing my mind. What can I, uh, sorry Mom, can you hold on one second? Um, Drella, can you take it down just a notch? (Drella is the harp player, and is playing very loud, she ignores Lorelai) Thanks. Okay, I'm back.\nGrandmother : I wanted you to known that I just bought a parking space for Rory at Chilton.\nL : You what?\nGrandmother : They are very hard to come by. But I pulled a few strings and it's all hers.\nL : Mom, Rory doesn't have a car.\nGrandmother : No, but she's got a birthday coming up soon.\n(Drella is still playing loudly and Lorelai can't hear)\nL : Okay, hold on a second. Um, Drella. Drella! A little softer please.\nDrella : Hey, do I look like I got Panasonic stamped on my ass?\nL : Mom, you are not buying Rory a car.\nGrandmother : Why not? She's a smart girl, she's responsible.\nL : She doesn't need one.\nGrandmother : She has to have a way to get around. To get to school.\nL : She'll be taking the bus.\nGrandmother : I hate that she's taking the bus. Drug dealers take the bus.\nL : You know what, Mom? I gotta go.\nGrandmother : Fine. We'll discuss this at a later date.\nL : Okay. Bye.\n(Drella plays much softer now that Lorelai is off the phone.)\n(scene changes)\n(Rory is walking down a Chilton hallway and Guy 1 comes up behind her.)\nGuy 1 : Hey, Mary.\nR : Me?\nGuy 1 : Yeah, you.\nR : My name is Rory.\nGuy 1 : I'm Tristin.\nR : Hi.\nTristin : So you new?\nR : Yeah, first day.\nTristin : Remmy's class is rough.\nR : Yeah, it seemed very intense.\nTristin : I could loan you my notes, if that would help.\nR : Really? That's be great.\nTristin : Yeah? How great? (he's walking forward, pushing her up against the wall)\nR : I don't know. Mr. Remmy said that getting someone's notes would be..\nTristin : I could even help you study. If you want.\nR : Uh, I kind of view studying as a solitary activity. But thanks.\nTristin : Bye Mary. (he walks off)\nR : It's Rory.\n(scene changes)\n(it's the parlor again, with Drella playing harp and people listening to her. Lorelai is talking to a man and a teenage guy)\nL : I completely understand.\nMan : Oh, do you. Because this is a brand-new car. (the boy tries to say something) He brings the car up and it's scratched!\nBoy : I just backed the car up.\nMan : I'd know if my car was scratched before I parked it or not.\nL : Let's calm down. Sir, why don't I have your car looked at tomorrow. I'm sure we can find a way to resolve this. In the meantime I would love for you to have lunch here, on me. Dessert is a must. Anything with our homemade ice cream is delicious. Life as you know it will never be the same. What do you say?\nMan : I think I will. Thank you.\nL : Thank you. (man walks off)\nBoy : Lorelai, I swear, I didn't scratch his car. If you thought I was unreliable or a bad driver..\nL : Derek. It's okay.\nBoy : 'Cause I can drive.\nL : Oh, sweetie. I am sure you can. We'll just take it over to Musky's tomorrow and have the guys look at it. I'm sure they can buff it out for nothing, okay?\nBoy : Okay. That's a real nice outfit you're wearing today.\nL : Thank you, Derek.\n(Derek walks off, Michel walks up)\nMichel : Your faithful pooch is here to say \"Someone needs to talk with you\".\nL : It's not my mother, is it?\nMichel : It's possible.\n(Lorelai looks around him, standing at the counter is Ian Jack, from Chilton)\nL : It's possible?\nMichel : There's a resemblance. (walks off)\nL : Hi.\nIan : Hi. Is this a bad time?\nL : No, not at all. What are you doing here?\nIan : Well, I had to meet an associate for lunch, and he was coming up from New York so I thought, \"Why not meet him in a beautiful inn?\"\nL : Good. Enjoy your lunch.\nIan : Thanks. I will. I was also wondering if maybe I could take you out to dinner sometime.\nL : We're a little food-obsessed, aren't we?\nIan : It's the company more than the food that interests me.\nL : I'm flattered.\nIan : Is that a yes?\nL : That's a You're a dad.\nIan : And you're a mom. Although I'm still finding that really hard to believe.\nL : No, I mean, you're a Chilton dad.\nIan : Ooh, that sounds bad.\nL : Not bad. Just tricky. You know, Rory just started there, and I think I should let her fall in with the bad crowd before I start hooking up with the P.T.A.\nIan: Well, I'm not on the P.T.A.\nL : See? There you go, I can't date anyone not on the P.T.A.\nIan : It's just a casual dinner.\nL : Sorry. (she walks around the counter)\nIan : Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going to China for a week on business. When I get back I'm going to try again\nL : China. Wow.\nIan : Impressed?\nL : No. Rome, I'd be impressed. China I'm just \"China, wow\"\nIan : (laughs, picks up a card from the desk, puts it in his suit) Lorelai Gilmore, General Manager, I'll talk to you soon.\nL : Have a safe trip.\nIan : I will. (walks off)\nL : (walking him walk off) He does that so well.\nMichel : You are making me sick.\nL : Aw, now, honey. You try it, I'll watch you walk away too.\nMichel : Stop it.\nL : Go on now, walk. It can't be that bad.\nMichel : Go away. (he walks off, she follows)\nL : No. You have to do it with a little more attitude. Make me think you mean it! (she walks off)\n(people are listening to Drella play the harp, she suddenly stops)\nDrella : That's lunch. (walks off, people look around surprised)\n(scene changes)\n(Rory is in Chilton, finds her locker, tries to open it, It's stuck, she pulls really hard and it opens, she stumble backward right into Paris who was holding a really big project of a intricate castle and dropped in when she got bumped into. The project broke into a million pieces)\nR : Oh no! I am so sorry. Paris, please. I am so sorry. It was an accident. My locker, it just slipped. I pulled too hard.. I didn't mean to.. Is there water in that moat?\nParis : Get away from me! (she stalks off into a classroom)\n(Rory picks up her books and puts them in her locker, and then taps a boy walking by)\nR : Excuse me, I need Mrs. Ness, History?\nBoy : It's behind you. (points to the classroom Paris walked into and leaves)\nR : Of course it is. (slams locker and walks into classroom)\nParis : (sees Rory) Oh, you've got to be kidding me.\n(Rory sits down in a seat, Tristin sits right near her.)\nTristin : Hey, Mary.\nTeacher : Ok, We left our projects off on Friday with Mr. Gaynor. So today we will pick up with Miss Geller.\nParis : (stands up) I don't have my project.\nTeacher : Miss Geller.. Did you have sufficient time to complete your project?\nParis : Yes\nTeacher : And yet you don't have it done?\nParis : No\nTeacher : You will receive an incomplete on the project.\nR : (stands up) It's my fault.\nTeacher : Who are you?\nR : Rory Gilmore. I wrecked her project.\nParis : Shut up.\nTeacher : I don't have a Rory Gilmore. I have a Lorelai Gilmore.\nR : That's me.\nTeacher : You are Rory and Lorelai Gilmore?\nR : Yes. And I wrecked her project. My locked got stuck.\nParis : Just stay out of this.\nTeacher : Do you go by Rory or Lorelai.\nR : Whatever. It's not her fault.\nTeacher : I need you to pick one.\nR : One what.\nTeacher : One name.\nR : Rory.\nTeacher : Thank you. Rory, you wrecked Paris' project when?\nR : Just before class.\nTeacher : Very convenient.\nR : No, I did. My locked got stuck\nParis : Stop it!\nTeacher : Miss Gilmore, since you say you wrecked Miss Geller's project, then you may help her fix it. You have until tomorrow.\nR : Fine.\nParis : No. I don't want your help!\nR : But I don't mind doing it.\nParis : Just stay out of this.\nR : I'm trying to help you.\nParis : Well don't!\nTeacher : Ladies, enough. Miss Geller, if you don't want Miss Gilmore's help you may have until tomorrow. If it's not done, you will receive an incomplete. Is that understood?\nParis : Yes. (sits down)\nTeacher : As long as you're standing, Class, we have a new student. Say hello to Rory Gilmore.\nClass : Hi, Rory.\nTristin : Hello Mary.\n(Rory sits down)\n(Commercials)\n(opening scene is the Welcome to Stars Hollow sign, Population 9,973. Scene shifts to Miss Patty next to the street and the girls in the studio, walking with books on their heads.)\nMiss Patty : Walk smooth. That's the new Harry Potter on your heads. If they should drop, Harry will die, and there won't be anymore books. (sees Lorelai walking by) Now that's how you should've dressed this morning, Missy.\n(Lorelai ignores her, scene shifts to Lorelai walking into Luke's diner. Luke is walking near the entrance and he has to squeeze by her to get through.)\nLuke : What are you doing here?\nL : See, now that's why you were voted Mr. Personality of the New Millennium. Where's your crown?\nLuke : I just mean you don't usually come it at this time.\nL : I have to pick up Rory from school. (Luke pours her coffee without any argument) Thank you.\nLuke : You're welcome.\nL : No lectures?\nLuke : My blood sugar's low. I'll eat an apple and get back to you.\nL : God, this has been one hectic, bizarro day for me.\nLuke : Yeah?\nL : Yeah. This morning with the being late. And my mother with her existing. Oh, and this father. This father from Chilton. He drove all the way from Hartford just to ask me out.\nLuke : Really? Are you going? (trying to appear like he doesn't care)\nL : No. He's got a kid in school with Rory. The whole thing just seemed a little weird.\nLuke : Good.\nL : Good?\nLuke : Yeah, I think it's good that you turned him down.\nL : Okay.\nLuke : I mean, he's probably old, right?\nL : Old?\nLuke : I mean, he's got a kid in high school.\nL : Well, so do I.\nLuke : Yeah, but you were young when you had Rory. Most people aren't that young. Most people are..\nL : Old.\nLuke : Yeah.\nL : Like this guy who asked me out.\nLuke : But you're not going.\nL : No. No, I'm not going.\n(she kind of smiles a bit, thinks he likes her, her cell phone rings, he points to the sign that says no cell phones)\nL : Oh, that's me. Hi Babette. What? Okay. No. No, I'll be right there. Thanks. (hangs up) Uh, I have to go. (pulls out wallet)\nLuke : Keep it. I gave you decaf.\n(she frowns and walks out the door)\n(scene changes)\n(A man and a woman holding a cat are sitting in their yard. They live right next to the Gilmores. Lorelai's jeep pulls up and she gets out)\nL : Hey.\nBabette : Oh, Lorelai, I'm so sorry I had to call you like this.\nL : That's okay, Babette. I appreciate it.\nBabette : All of a sudden, they pull up, get out of the truck, and start sniffing around. It's very strange.\nL : Let me go talk to them.\n(Lorelai pets cat, Man gets up and stands next to Babette)\nMan : Tell her about the gnome.\nBabette : They kicked a gnome.\nL : What?\nBabette : Right in the head.\nMan : That's just not cool.\nL : I'm very sorry. Is the gnome okay?\nBabette: He's fine, sugar. But I wouldn't trust these boys. Gnome kicking says a lot about a man's character.\nL : Yes, well, I'm gonna go take care of this. Thanks.\n(she walks over to her house, men are on the porch, she goes up the steps to talk to them)\nL : Hey. Um, what are you doing?\nMan 1 : You live here?\nL : Yeah.\nMan 1 : I'm supposed to install a DSL for a Lorelai Gilmore. Is that you?\nL : Yes, but..\nMan 1 : I'm Mick.\nL : Nice to meet you. Could you get off my porch?\nMick: I was told that you wouldn't be here, but to look for a ceramic frog with a key inside. We can't find the frog.\nL : I didn't order a DSL.\nMick : The order was placed by an -- Emily Gilmore (grandmother). We would've been done by now, but the frog search put us way behind.\nMan 2 : Hey, Mick, found it.\nMick : You found the frog?\nMan 2 : It wasn't a frog, it was a turtle.\nMick : It says here it's a frog.\nL : Turtle.\nMick : Really?\nL : Trust me. I'm going to have to cancel that DSL order.\nMick : You sure? It's already paid for.\nL : Yeah, I know. We don't need a DSL, so thanks for coming, and you guys can just go.\n(the guys leave, Lorelai walks over to the jeep)\nBabette : Is there a problem?\nL : Oh, nothing Shakespeare couldn't turn into a really good play.\n(Lorelai gets into jeep)\n(scene changes)\n(camera is on a piece of paper that says \"Paris -- I am so sorry. Please let me help you.\" In Rory's handwriting )\nTeacher : The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves so that no one could reform them, whereby Christians has fallen terribly. Who said this?\n(Rory gave the note to Paris, who immediately crumpled it up and threw it on the floor)\nR : (sees Paris about to give the answer) Martin Luther.\nTeacher : Very good, Miss Gilmore. And what year does Martin Luther address the Christian nobility?\nR : (again sees Paris lean forward) 1520.\nTeacher : Very good, Miss Gilmore. Until next time, class.\n(Paris goes up to Rory's desk)\nParis : Stay out of my way. I will make this school a living hell for you. (Rory swallows apprehensively.)\nTristin : See you tomorrow, Mary.\nRory : The name is Rory.\n(scene changes)\n(camera shows a street corner, then switches to the inside of a salon where Lorelai appears to be searching for somebody.)\nStylist : Can I help you?!\nL : (brushes past her) God, I wish. (knocks on her mother's hairdryer)\nGrandmother : What on earth..?\nL : You're not buying us a DSL.\nGrandmother : Lorelai, this is hardly the place.\nL : I canceled the order, and it's not happening.\nGrandmother : But Rory needs the Internet for her school.\nL : We have the Internet.\nGrandmother : This is faster.\nL : Well, we like our internet slow, okay? We can turn it on, walk around, dance, make a sandwich. With DSL, there's no dancing, no walking, and we'd starve. It'd be all work and no play. Have you not seen \"The Shining\", Mom?\nGrandmother : What on earth are you talking about?\nL : Also, there will be no cars, no parking spaces. And all the uniforms will be supplied by me. The mother. That's final. There will be no discussion.\nGrandmother : You're being stubborn, as usual.\nL : No, Mom, I'm not being stubborn. I'm being me! The same person who always needed to work out her own problems and take care of herself. Because that's the way I was born. That's how I am!\nGrandmother : Florence, I'm dripping.\nL : I appreciate what you have done for Rory in paying for this school, That will not be forgotten. You won't let it. But she is my daughter. And I decide how we live, not you. Now then, do they validate parking here?\nGrandmother : There's a stamp at the desk.\nL : Thank you.\n(Emily looks embarrassed and dismayed. Lorelai walks out.)\n(scene changes)\n(It's the outside of Chilton. Lorelai is drinking coffee and waiting for Rory to come out. Rory emerges.)\nL : Mm. Hey, you.\nR : (drops backpack and hugs Lorelai) So, this whole plaid-skirt thing My idea?\nL : My day sucked too.\nR : Promise?\nL : I swear on my mother's life.\nR : Not yet. (doesn't want to stop hugging.)\nL : Still hugging, still hugging. (smooch) So, I brought us some coffee.\nR : Why, I'm shocked.\nL : Triple caps, easy foam. If that doesn't work, we'll stick our fingers in a light socket. (laughs, picks up backpack) Come here. (staggers under weight) What, do they expect you to get smart all in one day?\nR : Oh, they expect a lot of things.\nL : So tell me.\nR : I don't know. It was just one big, long, scary, tweedy, bad eight hours.\nL : Add some hair spray, and you got my day.\nR : One of the girls already hates me. The guys are weird.\nL : Weirder than other guys?\nR : Yeah, they kept calling me Mary.\nL : You're kidding me. Wow, I can't believe they still say that.\nR : Why? What does it mean?\nL : It means like, Virgin Mary. It means they think you look like a goody-goody.\nR : You're kidding.\nL : No.\nR : Well what would they have called me if they thought I looked like a slut?\nL : Well, they might have added a Magdalene to it.\nR : Wow. Biblical insults. This is an advanced school.\n(they laugh, Lorelai turns over the engine)\n(scene changes)\n(it's night, the town is lit up by lights along the streets. Lorelai, Rory, and Lane are all walking with food in hand.)\nLane : It was so weird not having you in school today. I mean, I finally noticed some of the other kids. Let me say, they are a sad lot.\nR : Yeah, well add a couple plaid skirts, and you got the Chilton freaks.\nLane : I totally miss you.\nR : I miss you.\nL : I have an idea. What about, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, when I go into Hartford for my business class, what if Lane comes along and you guys can shop and study, and join a cult and shave your heads.\nLane : Really?\nL : All except the shaving your heads part.\nLane : Oh, no. What time is it?\nR : 6:30\nLane : Oh, no. I'm late for dinner.\nL : Again? Lane, your mother is gonna kill me if I keep sending you home fat and happy.\nLane : I'm sorry. But she found a web site that sells Tofu in bulk.\nL : Oh, you're kidding, right?\nLane : (shakes her head) Yesterday, she went out and bought a bigger fridge. (takes off her pink jacket, handing it to Rory, and shaking out her hair.)\nL : Boy, honey, your life is scary.\nLane : Can I have your crust? (to Rory, pizza crust)\nR : It's the least I can do.\nLane : Thanks. Bye.\nR : Bye.\nL : Bye. (watches her leave) A pizza for your thoughts.\nR : I wish I could figure out a way to get Paris off my back.\nL : Yeah, angry chicks are the worst. When I was in high school I had a Paris.\nR : Yeah?\nL : It was horrible.\nR : How'd you get rid of her?\nL : I got pregnant and dropped out.\nR : What if I just learn to french braid her hair.\nL : Even better. Sweetie, you can't let those kids get you down. Do you want me to talk to anybody? A parent, a teacher, a big guy named Moose?\nR : I'll just figure it out for myself.\nL : Okay. (sees Rory laugh) What?\nR : I was just thinking about the way Paris' face looked when I beat her to that Martin Luther question.\nL : Good, huh?\nR: 14 shades of purple.\nL : Cool.\nR: Tomorrow I'm shooting for 15.\nL : (they stop in front of Luke's diner) Hey, what do you think of Luke?\nR : What do you mean?\nL : I mean, do you think he's cute?\nR: Oh, no. No way. You cannot date Luke.\nL : I said nothing about dating Luke.\nR : If you date him, you'll break up. And we'll never be able to eat there again.\nL : I repeat, I said nothing about dating Luke.\nR : Date Al from Pancake World, his food stinks.\nL : I cannot believe what I'm hearing. Al's food does not stink, Al stinks.\n(Luke comes out of the diner and stares after the Gilmores. Then he closes his restaurant and goes back inside.)\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

His name: Merlin.\" Forest Arthur's hunting party sneaks through the woods.\nARTHUR: Merlin, spear. Merlin drops it on him.\nARTHUR: Do you have any natural gifts, Merlin?\nMERLIN: No. Well, let me think. I'm not naturally rude or insensitive.\nARTHUR: Just naturally irritating. They move forward and hear growling noises. Arthur catches Merlin's expression.\nARTHUR: It's probably more scared of you than you are of it. Arthur signals to his knights where to go. Questing Beast jumps out at them. Arthur drops his spear and they all run. Merlin falls. Arthur and Sir Bedivere help him up. Bedivere subsequently falls and gets killed by the beast.\nMERLIN: Have we lost it?\nARTHUR: Who's missing?\nMERLIN: Where's Sir Bedivere?\nSIR BEDIVERE: *scream* Castle - Council Chamber Of Doom\nGAIUS: The creature you describe has all the characteristics of the Questing Beast.\nARTHUR: Surely that's a myth.\nGAIUS: According to the old books, the appearance of the Questing Beast is supposed to foreshadow a time of great upheaval.\nUTHER: Gaius, it's an old wives' tale.\nARTHUR: Look, whatever it is, it's spreading panic. The people fear it will enter the city.\nUTHER: Then we must kill it. Arthur, gather the guard together. You ride at dawn.\nGAIUS: I beg you, Sire, do not dismiss this. The beast is an omen. I've seen it come before, the night your wife Ygraine passed away.\nUTHER: I've told you not to speak of that night again. I have conquered the Old Religion. It's warnings mean nothing to me now. Arthur will destroy the beast and we will no longer suffer at its hand. Gaius's Chambers\nGAIUS: This is no ordinary beast, Merlin.\nMERLIN: Don't worry.\nGAIUS: No, listen to me, you don't understand. Uther may not respect the Old Religion, but it is very real. To face a beast such as this, you must understand where it came from.\nMERLIN: What do you mean?\nGAIUS: At the very heart of the Old Religion lies the magic of life and death itself. The Questing Beast carries that power. One bite, you die, and there is no cure. Morgana's Chambers Morgana dreams of the dragon flaming, Merlin yelling \"NO!\", Arthur and Merlin running in the woods, Arthur lying sick in bed, and the Questing Beast. Morgana bolts up in bed screaming.\nGWEN: Morgana? Morgana?! Wake up. Gwen struggles with flailing Morgana.\nGWEN: Wake up, it's me! It's Gwen! Stop it! It was just another dream.\nMORGANA: It was terrifying.\nGWEN: Oh, it's going to be alright. Gwen hugs Morgana. Castle - Main Square Arthur speaks to his knights.\nARTHUR: You've seen the foe we face. It's a creature of nightmare, but you are the best knights in the realm. We can, and we will, kill it before it harms another citizen of our kingdom. Arthur draws his sword.\nARTHUR: For the love of Camelot! The knights draw swords.\nKNIGHTS: For the love of Camelot! Morgana rushes out of the palace in her nightgown, hysterical.\nMORGANA: Arthur!\nARTHUR: Morgana, what are you doing?\nMORGANA: You cannot face this! Morgana tries to grab him, Arthur struggles with her.\nARTHUR: Morgana, go back to bed. There is nothing to be afraid of.\nMORGANA: Please, Arthur. I have seen terrible things! You cannot go!\nMERLIN: She probably had a bad dream, Sire. I'll take her to see Gaius.\nMORGANA: No! I will not let you go!\nARTHUR: Please, Merlin, get her inside.\nMORGANA: No! Arthur hands her off to Merlin and motions for the guards to come down. Merlin guides Morgana up the steps.\nMERLIN: I will make sure he's safe, My Lady. I promise.\nMORGANA: No! Merlin hands her off to the guards.\nMORGANA: No! Guards lead her inside. Forest Arthur and knights sneak through the woods. Arthur finds gigantic paw print.\nARTHUR: Let's follow the trail. They hear growling and heavy footfalls.\nARTHUR: Keep close. They find and enter beast's lair. Merlin and Arthur split from the rest. they hear hissing.\nMERLIN: What is it?\nARTHUR: Shh! Questing Beast sneaks up on them. Arthur pushes Merlin out of the way and takes on the beast. The beast claws him in the chest, throwing him to the ground. It moves in on Arthur. Merlin tries to distract it by waving his torch.\nMERLIN: Hey! Hey! Merlin uses magic to pick up Arthur's dropped sword.\nMERLIN: Fléoge! Bregdan anwiele gefeluc! Merlin enchants the sword and magically throws it into the Questing Beast, killing it. Merlin goes to Arthur and shakes him.\nMERLIN: It didn't bite you. It didn't. Merlin sees blood on his hand.\nMERLIN: Arthur?! Somebody help me! Gaius's Chambers Merlin clears a table with one sweep. Guards place Arthur's stretcher on it.\nGAIUS: What's happened? Gaius looks at Arthur's wound.\nGAIUS: He's been bitten.\nMERLIN: I tried to save him.\nGAIUS: You must tell the King.\nMERLIN: There must be something you can do.\nGAIUS: I wish there was.\nMERLIN: I'll find a cure.\nGAIUS: Merlin!\nMERLIN: Trust me! Merlin bolts into his room.\nGAIUS: Can you hear me, Sire?\nMERLIN: Here. Merlin brings out magic book.\nGAIUS: The King'll be here any moment!\nMERLIN: He can't die. It is my destiny to protect him. We haven't done all the things we're meant to do.\nGAIUS: That is a lament of all men.\nMERLIN: Gaius, he's my friend.\nGAIUS: Then save him. Merlin uses magic to flip through the book.\nMERLIN: Gestathole. Nothing happens. Merlin flips through the book again.\nMERLIN: Thurhhaele. Nothing happens.\nMERLIN: Maybe the spells need time to take effect.\nGAIUS: The bite of the Questing Beast is a death sentence that no magic can overturn.\nUTHER: Where is the Prince?! Where is my son?! Uther enters.\nUTHER: Arthur! Merlin magically closes his magic book.\nUTHER: Do something, Gaius!\nGAIUS: I am trying, your majesty.\nMERLIN: Gaius will find a cure. He will not let him die.\nGAIUS: I will do everything in my power. Uther desperately picks up Arthur himself.\nUTHER: I'll bear him to his chamber. Castle - Main Square Uther walks through the Square with Arthur in his arms, Merlin and Gaius following. Uther collapses in his grief. Four knights come to bear Arthur inside as the King weeps on his knees. Morgana opens a window and watches the scene below. Dragon's Cave Merlin rushes to the Dragon's Cave.\nMERLIN: I have failed Arthur, failed in my destiny.\nKILGHARRAH: And yet, you would not be here if that were true.\nMERLIN: He was bitten by the Questing Beast. He's going to die.\nKILGHARRAH: Does he still breathe?\nMERLIN: Only just.\nKILGHARRAH: Then there is still time to heal him.\nMERLIN: I've tried. I cannot save him.\nKILGHARRAH: You do not know how to save him.\nMERLIN: But you can tell me how?\nKILGHARRAH: Perhaps. It will not be easy.\nMERLIN: I will do anything.\nKILGHARRAH: Anything?\nMERLIN: Please, just tell me what I have to do!\nKILGHARRAH: Very well. The Questing Beast is a creature conjured by the powers of the Old Religion. You must use the same ancient magic to save him.\nMERLIN: But the Old Religion died out centuries ago.\nKILGHARRAH: The Old Religion is the magic of the earth itself. It is the essence which binds all things together. It will last long beyond the time of men.\nMERLIN: But how can that help me save Arthur?\nKILGHARRAH: You must find those who still serve it. Those who hold dominion over life and death.\nMERLIN: Where?\nKILGHARRAH: Go to the place that men call the Isle of the Blessed, where the power of the ancients can still be felt. There you will discover Arthur's salvation.\nMERLIN: Thank you. Thank you.\nKILGHARRAH: And Merlin, the young Pendragon must live, no matter what the cost. Gaius's Chambers\nGAIUS: Merlin, you're back. I need your help. You must get this to Arthur to ease his passing.\nMERLIN: No. We have to save him. Merlin starts packing food.\nGAIUS: You've already tried.\nMERLIN: The beast comes from the Old Religion. The cure must come from there as well.\nGAIUS: There are not many left with such an art.\nMERLIN: You said yourself, the Old Religion is still alive, and there is an island beyond the White Mountains...\nGAIUS: No!\nMERLIN: The Isle of the Blessed...You know it?\nGAIUS: It was said to be the centre of the Old Religion, the focus of its power.\nMERLIN: Why did you keep this from me?\nGAIUS: Because it was too dangerous, Merlin.\nMERLIN: It's our only chance! I have to find it!\nGAIUS: And once you are there, what will you ask?\nMERLIN: For Arthur to be saved.\nGAIUS: The Questing Beast chose Arthur. That means the Old Religion has decided his fate.\nMERLIN: Then I will convince them to change their minds!\nGAIUS: It is not that simple! The High Priests have the power to mirror life and death, but there will be a price to pay. They will demand a life in return. Merlin, please, I beg of you.\nMERLIN: I'm sorry, Gaius. Whatever the price is, I will pay it gladly. Arthur lies dying in his bed. Castle - Gate Merlin prepares his horse to leave. Gaius approaches him.\nGAIUS: Here. Gaius hands Merlin rolled parchment.\nGAIUS: You'll need a map. And I'm going to give you this. My mother gave it to me. Merlin unwraps tiny package.\nGAIUS: It's a rabbit's foot.\nMERLIN: To keep you safe.\nGAIUS: It was said to protect you from evil spirits. It's rubbish. I don't believe in superstition. I don't know why I gave it to you. Gaius reaches to take it back.\nMERLIN: No. I want it. Thank you. (sigh) You've got to keep Arthur alive until I get back. Merlin mounts and rides off through the woods. Arthur's Chambers Arthur stirs in his fevered sleep. Uther watches him.\nUTHER: Shh. Sleep, Arthur. Countryside Merlin travels through the countryside with the map.\nKILGHARRAH (voiceover): You must travel to the place that men call the Isle of the Blessed. Beyond the White Mountains. Through the Valley of the Fallen Kings. To the north of the great seas of place name: Marador, you will find a lake. Arthur's Chambers Gaius is asleep in the chair next to Arthur's sick bed. Gwen enters and knocks on the door to wake Gaius.\nGWEN: Gaius? You should get some rest.\nGAIUS: He must not be left alone.\nGWEN: I will nurse him. Gaius leaves. Gwen takes the towel from Arthur's forehead, dips it in a bowl of water, and sits on the bed to tend to him.\nGWEN: You're not going to die, Arthur. I'm telling you. Because I know that one day you will be King. A greater king than you father could ever be. It's what keeps me going. You are going to live to be the man I've seen inside you, Arthur. I can see a Camelot that is fair and just. I can see a king that the people will love and be proud to call their sovereign. For the love of Camelot, you have to live. Arthur's Chambers A crowd gathers outside Arthur's window holding candles. Uther watches from the Griffin Landing window. Gaius comes up behind him.\nGAIUS: Is there anything I can get your majesty?\nUTHER: The people have begun to say goodbye.\nGAIUS: He's not yet gone, Sire.\nUTHER: But he will not recover.\nGAIUS: Not without a miracle.\nUTHER: I don't believe in miracles. Lake / Isle Of The Blessed Merlin approaches the lake, steps in a little boat.\nMERLIN: Astyre. The propels boat across the lake. Merlin steps out into the fortress on the island and looks around.\nMERLIN: Hello?\nNIMUEH: Hello, Merlin.\nMERLIN: You.\nNIMUEH: Do you know who I am?\nMERLIN: Nimueh. You can't be who the dragon meant.\nNIMUEH: And why is that?\nMERLIN: You tried to kill me.\nNIMUEH: Before I understood your importance.\nMERLIN: And Arthur.\nNIMUEH: Arthur was never destined to die at my hand, and now it seems I will be his salvation.\nMERLIN: So you know what I've come to ask?\nNIMUEH: Yes.\nMERLIN: Will you do it?\nNIMUEH: I do not have the power to mirror life itself and yet give nothing in return.\nMERLIN: I know that a price will be asked.\nNIMUEH: To save a life, there must be a death. The balance of the world must be restored.\nMERLIN: I willingly give my life for Arthur's.\nNIMUEH: How brave you are, Merlin. If only it were that simple.\nMERLIN: What do you mean?\nNIMUEH: Once you enter into this bargain, it cannot be undone.\nMERLIN: Whatever I have to do, I will do. His life is worth a hundred of mine.\nNIMUEH: The Cup of Life, blessed by centuries of powerful sorcerers so that it contains the very secret of life itself. If Arthur drinks water from the Cup, he will live. Merlin takes the Cup.\nNIMUEH: Tídrénas. Nimueh makes it rain on Merlin for a moment. Merlin collects the water in the Cup. Nimueh takes the Cup and pours the water into a small, decorative canteen.\nNIMUEH: The bargain is struck. I hope it pleases you. Merlin rides into Camelot the next morning. Gaius's Chambers\nGAIUS: Merlin!\nMERLIN: We need to give this to Arthur. Merlin hands Gaius the decorative canteen.\nGAIUS: What is it?\nMERLIN: Water drawn from the Cup of Life. If Arthur drinks from it, he will recover. Please hurry. Gaius begins to walk out, but stops and faces Merlin.\nMERLIN: What are you waiting for?\nGAIUS: What price did you pay to redeem his life? Whose life did you bargain?!\nMERLIN: We don't have time.\nGAIUS: Merlin!\nMERLIN: Don't worry, Gaius! Everything's going to be alright. Gaius and Merlin giving Arthur the water. Uther enters.\nUTHER: What are you doing, physician? What are you giving him?\nGAIUS: It's a... It's a tincture made from the lobelia plant, an ancient remedy for poisonous bites.\nUTHER: A cure?\nGAIUS: We hope.\nUTHER: Do you really think it will have some effect?\nGAIUS: It's our last resort, Sire. Perhaps you should allow him to rest.\nUTHER: I will not leave him. Gaius and Merlin exit. Uther sits by Arthur's bedside. Castle - Central Corridor Gaius and Merlin head down the corridor. Morgana grabs Merlin's arm and pulls him into an alcove.\nMORGANA: Please, Merlin, you must beware. This is only the beginning. Merlin pulls away and continues down the corridor. Arthur's Chambers Gaius paces in Arthur's Chambers, Uther sleeps hunched over the bed. Arthur wakes. Uther wakes.\nUTHER: Arthur. Arthur looks around and puts his head back down. Gaius's Chambers Gaius enters in his chambers where Merlin is pacing.\nGAIUS: The Prince lives. Arthur's Chambers\nUTHER: I thought we'd lost you.\nARTHUR: Don't worry, Father, I'm not going to die. I think there's someone watching over me, keeping me from harm.\nUTHER: Maybe you're right. On your long journey to become King, you will need a guardian angel. I shall inform the court that their Prince lives. Gwen enters as Uther exits. she puts down the towels she's carrying and looks anxiously at Arthur. Arthur opens his eyes and turns to look at her. Gwen smiles in relief.\nGWEN: I knew it. I said you'd be alright.\nARTHUR: I can remember you talking to me.\nGWEN: You can?\nARTHUR: You stroked my forehead.\nGWEN: I was tending to your fever.\nARTHUR: You never lost faith.\nGWEN: I was just talking.\nARTHUR: Tell me again what you said?\nGWEN: I don't remember.\nARTHUR: Yes, you do.\nGWEN: No, I don't.\nARTHUR: Come on. Something about \"the man I am inside.\"\nGWEN: No, I never said that.\nARTHUR: Guinevere...\nGWEN: I have to get these washed, Sire. Gwen exits hurriedly with the dirty cloths. Arthur grins in amusement.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMerlin's Chamber Merlin sits on his bed, waiting to die, while a thunderstorm whips through the night. A figure enters the Camelot on foot. A trembling diseased hand opens the door to the Physician's Chambers. We see Morgana bolting awake screaming. Morning comes and Merlin is still alive. He rushes out of his room.\nMERLIN: Gaius! I'm alive! Gaius is crouching over a collapsed figure on the floor.\nMERLIN: What is it? What's happened?\nGAIUS: Merlin, stay there!\nMERLIN: What's wrong?\nGAIUS: No, don't! Merlin walks over to see Hunith, covered in sores, struggling to breathe on the floor.\nMERLIN: Mother!\nHUNITH: Merlin.\nMERLIN: What's happened to her?\nGAIUS: She's gravely ill.\nMERLIN: Do something!\nGAIUS: If I could.\nMERLIN: Please, Gaius!\nGAIUS: Merlin, this is no ordinary illness.\nMERLIN: This cannot happen.\nGAIUS: Who did you meet at the Isle of the Blessed?\nMERLIN: Nimueh.\nGAIUS: Nimueh?!\nMERLIN: It was as you said. She demanded a price, but I bargained my life, not my mothers.\nGAIUS: Merlin. I wish there was something I could do.\nMERLIN: I will make you better. I will. Dragon's Cave\nMERLIN: You knew this would happen! You had me trade my mother's life for Arthur's!\nKILGHARRAH: You said you would do anything.\nMERLIN: Did you know my mother would die?\nKILGHARRAH: I knew the price would be a heavy one.\nMERLIN: But you sent me anyway.\nKILGHARRAH: We need Arthur to live.\nMERLIN: I'm not one of you!\nKILGHARRAH: We are both creatures of the Old Religion. It is the source of your power.\nMERLIN: What's that supposed to mean?\nKILGHARRAH: Your destiny is to protect the young Pendragon until he claims his crown. And when he does, magic can be returned to the realm. Only then will I be free.\nMERLIN: Oh. So that's all you cared about? I thought you were my friend.\nKILGHARRAH: I am more than that, Merlin. I am your kin.\nMERLIN: No. The only family I have is my mother, and you had me murder her.\nKILGHARRAH: Her life has not been taken in vain. We will achieve great things together, you and I.\nMERLIN: You will never be released! For what you've done, I'll make sure you never see the light.\nKILGHARRAH: Merlin! The Great Dragon breathes fire at him.\nMERLIN: Gescildan! Merlin blocks the flames.\nMERLIN: You won't see me again. Gaius's Chambers Merlin returns.\nMERLIN: Where is she?\nGAIUS: She's sleeping.\nMERLIN: I have to save her.\nGAIUS: You cannot.\nMERLIN: If the balance of the world needs a life, then Nimueh must take mine.\nGAIUS: No, Merlin.\nMERLIN: Yes. I will return to the island.\nGAIUS: You are young. Your gifts, your destiny are far too precious to sacrifice.\nMERLIN: My destiny? This is my mother. My powers mean nothing if I cannot save her. You have taught me so much. Taught me who I am. Taught me the purpose for my skills. Taught me that magic should only be used for great deeds. But most of all, you have always taught me to do what is right.\nGAIUS: Merlin.\nMERLIN (sniffle): I need to say goodbye to Arthur. Arthur's Chambers Merlin enters as Arthur is pouring himself a drink, his other arm in a sling.\nARTHUR: Ah, Merlin.\nMERLIN: How are you?\nARTHUR: Good.\nMERLIN: I'm pleased.\nARTHUR: Yes. I owe it all to Gaius.\nMERLIN: I need to talk to you.\nARTHUR: You still haven't got it yet, have you? I decide when we need to talk.\nMERLIN: Not today.\nARTHUR: I sometimes wonder if you know who I am.\nMERLIN: Oh, I know who you are.\nARTHUR: Good.\nMERLIN: You're a prat. And a royal one.\nARTHUR (chuckle): Are you ever going to change, Merlin?\nMERLIN: No, you'd get bored. But promise me this, if you get another servant, don't get a bootlicker.\nARTHUR: If this is you trying to leave your job...\nMERLIN: No. I'm happy to be your servant. Till the day I die.\nARTHUR: Sometimes I think I know you, Merlin. Other times... *shakes head*\nMERLIN: Well, I know you. And you're a great warrior. One day, you'll be a great king.\nARTHUR: That's very kind of you.\nMERLIN: But you must learn to listen as well as you fight.\nARTHUR: Any other pointers?\nMERLIN: No. That's it. Just...don't be a prat. Merlin's Chamber Merlin enters his chamber where Gwen is sitting by Hunith's bedside.\nGWEN: Gaius had to go and get some supplies. He asked me to keep an eye on her until you got back.\nMERLIN: Thank you.\nGWEN: I'm sorry.\nMERLIN: No, she'll get better.\nGWEN: I've tried to make her feel comfortable.\nMERLIN: You have such a good heart, Gwen. Don't ever lose that. Gwen leaves and Merlin goes to sit with his mother.\nMERLIN: I'm going to make you well again. I promise. You'll see.\nHUNITH: You're such a good son.\nMERLIN: But I don't want you to worry about me. I know that the gods will look after me, and that one day I will see you again.\nHUNITH: I will miss you.\nMERLIN: I will miss you, too. Merlin takes out the rabbit's foot and gives it to his mother. Gaius's Chambers Merlin comes out of his room and begins packing for his trip the next morning.\nMERLIN: Gaius? Merlin finds a note with his name on it. Merlin reads it while Gaius travels to the Isle of the Blessed.\nGAIUS (voiceover): Dear Merlin, My life is already near to its end. There has, for the most part, been very little purpose to it, very little that will be remembered. In contrast, Merlin, your life is destined for greatness. Live by the tenets I have taught you, and I believe you will, in time, become the greatest warlock ever. To have known you has been my greatest pleasure, and to sacrifice myself for you is but an honour. You are and always will be the son I never had.\nMERLIN: No! Merlin rides out of Camelot. Isle Of The Blessed Gaius steps out of the boat onto the island.\nNIMUEH: I never thought I'd see you here again.\nGAIUS: My Lady.\nNIMUEH: It's a long time since you called me that.\nGAIUS: I come to ask for your help.\nNIMUEH: As you did once before for Uther? You did not like the outcome.\nGAIUS: I offer a chance for you to atone for the death of his wife.\nNIMUEH: I have saved the life of her son. What more do you ask for?\nGAIUS: That this time, you take a just price. Merlin intends to offer his life for his mother's. I want you to take mine in his place.\nNIMUEH (laughs): With all my powers of prediction, I could never have foretold this. Gaius the hero. Why should I grant your wish? You stood and watched as our friends burned in the Great Purge. You are nothing but a traitor.\nGAIUS: Merlin is the one man who can bring magic back to this land. At Arthur's side, he can help forge a new kingdom. A world of peace and beauty that we can only dream of.\nNIMUEH: And you're willing to give your life, Gaius, for the future they will bring? I'm waiting. Are you ready to die, Gaius? Gaius?\nGAIUS: For Merlin I will give my life. Merlin approaches edge of the lake of the Isle of the Blessed, he can hear Nimueh.\nNIMUEH: Ic, séo héahsácerd, þe ácwile strengþe ealdan æwfæstnesse! Merlin rushes onto the island.\nMERLIN: Stop!\nNIMUEH: Back again so soon, warlock?\nMERLIN: What have you done?\nNIMUEH: Your mother is safe. Isn't that what you wanted?\nMERLIN: Have you killed him?\nNIMUEH: It was his wish.\nMERLIN: I bid my life for Arthur's, not my mother's, not Gaius's!\nNIMUEH: The Old Religion does not care who lives and who dies! Only that the balance of the world is restored. To save a life, a life must be taken. Gaius knew this.\nMERLIN: It is not the Old Religion that has done this. It is you.\nNIMUEH: Come now. We are too valuable to each other to be enemies.\nMERLIN: No! I share nothing with you!\nNIMUEH: With my help, Arthur will become King.\nMERLIN: I will make Arthur King. But you will never see that day. Ástríce! Nimueh absorbs his attack.\nNIMUEH: Your childish tricks are useless against me, Merlin. I am a priestess of the Old Religion. Forbærne! You, too, are a creature of the Old Religion. You should join me.\nMERLIN: You think I would join forces with such a selfish and cruel magic? Never.\nNIMUEH: So be it. Ácwele! The spell hits Merlin.\nNIMUEH: Pity. Together we could've ruled the world. Nimueh walks away. Merlin gets up and glares at her.\nMERLIN: You should not have killed my friend. Merlin uses the power from the clouds to strike Nimueh down. Merlin runs to Gaius.\nMERLIN: Gaius! Gaius! Merlin cradles unconscious Gaius.\nMERLIN: No! No! *cries*\nGAIUS: Merlin.\nMERLIN: Gaius. Gaius. Gaius, you're alive!\nGAIUS: What did you do?\nMERLIN: Nimueh's dead. The balance of the world has been restored.\nGAIUS: You amaze me. You've mastered the power of life and death itself. We'll make a great warlock of you yet.\nMERLIN: So you believe in me now?\nGAIUS: Well, I would do if...if you could stop this blasted rain. They laugh.\nKILGHARRAH: Merlin! No! *roar* Morgana wakes from a nightmare.\nSpecial thanks to Lika_mikala for allowing us to use all of her scripts.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The text is a summary of the events that took place in the episode \"The Beginning of the End\" of the television series Merlin. In the episode, Merlin and Gaius are on the Isle of the Blessed, where they meet Nimueh, a powerful sorceress. Nimueh tells them that she has killed Arthur's father, Uther Pendragon, and that she has taken his life force to restore the balance of the world. Merlin is horrified by this and uses his magic to try to stop Nimueh, but she is too powerful. Merlin then uses the power of the clouds to strike Nimueh down, saving Gaius's life. However, the rain continues to fall, and Merlin and Gaius are forced to leave the island.</s>The invention provides a method for preparing a high-purity nano-silicon powder, which comprises the following steps:"

She's just trying to sing and her mom won't stop talking.\nLORELAI: Big Edie was so beautiful in her day.\nRORY: They were both pretty.\nLORELAI: I can't believe they were related to Jackie.\nRORY: Well, the Kennedy's kind of hid them in the background for many years.\nLORELAI: Well, when you're a Kennedy, how do you even choose who in the family to hide?\nRORY: It's a tough choice.\nLORELAI: Something beautiful about them though. They're cool, they're free.\nRORY: Yeah, and they're memorable. Most people are very forgettable. And they're happy.\nLORELAI: They had their cats.\nRORY: And their raccoons.\nLORELAI: And their pretty house.\nRORY: And each other.\nLORELAI: Add a few years and they're us.\nRORY: Yeah. . .yeah.\nLORELAI: Yeah.\n[opening credits]\nCUT TO THE INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN\n[Sookie rushes around giving instructions]\nSOOKIE: Rhiana, run it through the sieve again, I want it smooth as glass. Don't cut corners, people!\nLORELAI: Is she melting down?\nMICHEL: Like butter on a skillet.\nLORELAI: Sookie. . .\nSOOKIE: Just a sec, hon. How's your love life, Pete? A little frustrated, I bet. Wondering how I know that? Cause you're taking it out on my egg whites. Gently, fold them gently. Cheryl  you're slicing not dicing, I can hear it in the chop. Adjust, my friend.\nLORELAI: Sookie, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, let's talk.\nSOOKIE: I'm extremely lacking in time here.\nLORELAI: What's going on?\nSOOKIE: Uh, chaos? Uh, a travesty of cooking? It's a salmonella laboratory in here!\nLORELAI: Sookie, the kitchen will be in good hands.\nSOOKIE: But not in my hands.\nLORELAI: It'll be in Bob hands. Bob has great hands.\nSOOKIE: No, you know what Bob has? Bob has two seconds to get the hollandaise off the flame before I break his neck!\nLORELAI: Sookie, listen, you hired Bob. You trained him in your image. He's great, and he's subbed for you before.\nSOOKIE: But this is Thanksgiving, he has never done Thanksgiving.\nLORELAI: He's ready, he'll sub for you seamlessly. Even Big Joe Newsanchor's have substitutes.\nSOOKIE: And that's the thing. They still say, And now the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather.' You see? Dan is still associated with it even though he's off snorkeling or something, just like I'm gonna be associated with the dinner because Bob is substituting for Sookie. Excuse me one minute.\n[Sookie starts rummaging through the trash can]\nMICHEL: Oh, this can only be good.\nLORELAI: Sookie, that's the garbage. Stop rooting through the garbage.\nSOOKIE: I will when people stop throwing away useful stuff!\nLORELAI: Drop, drop the, drop the tops, drop them, drop them. Come here, come here, come here. Now, Sookie, listen to me because you're torturing yourself here.\n[Emily walks in and stands behind Lorelai]\nSOOKIE: Emily, hi.\nLORELAI: Oh, that's nice. That's very high school. Stick with me here.\nSOOKIE: Good to see you.\nLORELAI: Yeah, ah, that's funny. You know who's behind you? It's Joseph Stalin, my good friend. What are you doing back from the dead, Joe?\nEMILY: Lorelai.\nLORELAI: Oh, Mom! Ah, geez, you scared me.\nEMILY: You heard Sookie greet me.\nLORELAI: Oh, I thought it was a joke.\nEMILY: Like comparing me to Joseph Stalin?\nLORELAI: I wasn't comparing you to Joseph Stalin.\nEMILY: I'm in a hurry. Can we speak for a minute?\nLORELAI: Yeah, I guess, for a minute. So, were you in the area or something?\nEMILY: Not really.\nLORELAI: Then what are you doing here?\nEMILY: I wanted to talk to you.\nLORELAI: Phone's out of order?\nEMILY: Let's not play games here.\nLORELAI: Games?\nEMILY: I've called several times the past few weeks and you've skillfully avoided every call.\nLORELAI: No, that's not true. I've left messages on your machine.\nEMILY: Yes, messages. And then if I happened to pick up, you'd hang up. Or if the maid picked up, you'd ask for me, then claim you were driving through a tunnel so you might get cut off, and then you'd make garbling noises and hang up.\nLORELAI: Fine, Mom, we're talking now. What's up?\nEMILY: Are you feeling well?\nLORELAI: You came all the way out here to ask me that?\nEMILY: Well, you've been sick these past few Friday's for dinner, so I was concerned. That's why you didn't come, right, because you were sick? So are you better? You look fine.\nLORELAI: Oh, it's the makeup. I'm still. . .uh, these allergies really just hit me like a ton of bricks.\nEMILY: I've never heard you mention allergies before.\nLORELAI: I'm a silent sufferer.\nEMILY: Well, I certainly hope you're feeling better now because I want you to come to dinner tomorrow night.\nLORELAI: Tomorrow? Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.\nEMILY: Yes, it is Thanksgiving. And before you sift through the dozen or so excuses you always have on hand, let me have my say. You've missed two dinners and avoided my calls because you're mad at us about what happened at Yale. But I want you and Rory at Thanksgiving this year.\nLORELAI: Mom \nEMILY: If you have plans \nLORELAI: We do have plans.\nEMILY: Alter them. Now, there'll be other people there, so the focus won't be on you, and you may even be able to get by without saying more than hello', goodbye', and pass the gravy'.\nLORELAI: We already have plans.\nEMILY: Your father and I are going out of town the next day and we'll be gone all of December, including Christmas, so it's the last chance for the family to be together for the rest of the year.\nLORELAI: Look \nEMILY: And I want you to remember that I am not the one who set the meeting for Rory behind your back. I want you there, Lorelai. And if you're still sick, I don't want a doctor's note. I want your doctor himself to come to my house and convince me that it's true, got it?\nLORELAI: Got it.\nEMILY: See you tomorrow.\nCUT TO CHILTON\nTEACHER: The multi-layered membrane systems of the cytoplasm are the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the golgi body. Now, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is concerned with the manufacture of lipid molecules. [bell rings] We'll continue on this next week. Keep up on your reading please.\nMADELINE: That was really distracting.\nPARIS: Oh. Well, by all means, Madeline, you should point out to the faculty that their annoying custom of teaching is distracting you from more important things like nail filing and daydreaming about marrying Ryan Phillippe.\nLOUISE: Uh, he's already married.\nPARIS: Then whatever strawhead actor isn't.\nMADELINE: This was bad. For the last five minutes, every single thing she said sounded dirty.\nLOUISE: Yeah, same here.\nPARIS: Good God.\nMADELINE: I mean, reticulum? Come on.\nLOUISE: Plus, the golgi body. I mean, is it me or is that majorly pornographic?\nPARIS: My life with the Banger sisters.\nRORY: So, changing the subject. . .\nPARIS: Hallelujah.\nRORY: What's everybody doing for Thanksgiving?\nPARIS: I can't even talk about Thanksgiving.\nRORY: Louise?\nLOUISE: Im having dinner with my dad.\nMADELINE: Isn't he still in jail?\nLOUISE: Yes, but his company donated some treadmills for the inmates so he swung a special trailer for dinner that they're gonna set up for us in the parking lot. We have it for about two hours and then one of the Manson girls gets us.\nMADELINE: You're lucky it's in that order.\nPARIS: My Thanksgiving is turning into a Wes Craven movie.\nRORY: How so?\nPARIS: I called shelters to volunteer to serve food. It's Thanksgiving  you'd think they have needs. Nope. Every stupid soup kitchen in town turned me down because they have enough volunteers.\nMADELINE: Bummer.\nPARIS: I'm on a couple waiting lists, but it doesn't look good.\nRORY: I've never heard of too many volunteers.\nPARIS: Who are all these jackasses who volunteered anyway? They can't all be students like me. They're not all putting it on a college application. I get something out of it and these other people don't get a thing. Talk about selfish.\nLOUISE: Sore subject.\nRORY: What are you up to, Madeline?\nMADELINE: I've got more college applications to fill out. Backups, safety schools.\nLOUISE: I've got some of that, too. I'm so behind.\nPARIS: I told you guys to have those things done by now.\nLOUISE: Sorry, Mom.\nPARIS: It's not about being sorry. It's about being prepared. I got Harvard and my backups in weeks ago.\nMADELINE: Okay, all you're doing is making me more nervous. I'll see you guys Monday.\nLOUISE: Same here.\nRORY: Yup, see you guys Monday.\nPARIS: Harvard is going to be expecting Thanksgiving shelter work. They'll know I called too late and it will totally impugn my organizational skills. By the way, you know I ultimately do all these things for the good of mankind, right?\nRORY: Oh yeah.\nPARIS: Sometimes I don't think I come off that way.\nRORY: No.\n[Paris' cell phone rings]\nPARIS: [answers phone] Hello? . . . Yes, thanks for returning my call. . . nothing? But wait, wait, wait  just stick me at any old pot. I'm small, you won't even know I'm there, I'll even bring my own ladle. . . .Oh, now, come on, work with me here. I've got a slotted spoon. . . Well, what about coffee or condiments? You got condiments covered? . . . I'm sorry, can I speak to your supervisor? . . . My attitude? What about your attitude? I'm trying to help people. It's Thanksgiving. . .\nCUT TO STARS HOLLOW\n[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the sidewalk]\nRORY: So she coldcocked you, huh?\nLORELAI: She bit me, incapacitated me with her poison, and devoured me whole.\nRORY: But how are we going to go to four Thanksgiving dinners?\nLORELAI: It's not four, is it?\nRORY: Lane's house, Sookie's, and we always stop by Luke's. . .that's three, and Grandma and Grandpa is four.\nLORELAI: Ah, we're mad, Edie.\nRORY: We're us, Edie.\nLORELAI: Well, we've gotta go to my parents' or we'll be brought up on war crimes. Lane's is always super early, so that's easy to catch. Sookie's is mid afternoon.\nRORY: Luke's the toughie.\nLORELAI: Guess that's the one we'll have to skip.\nRORY: Bummer.\nLORELAI: I know, but he won't care. Holidays are nothing to him anyway.\n[Kirk walks out of The Chat Club with several bags]\nLORELAI: Hey Kirk. Discover a new freaky fetish?\nKIRK: What?\nLORELAI: Nothing. You buy a cat?\nKIRK: Yup. I'm very excited.\nLORELAI: You seem it. So what's all this?\nRORY: I'm assuming there's nothing left in the store.\nKIRK: Actually, there are a number of things left.\nRORY: No, I meant you seem to be buying a lot of stuff.\nKIRK: Oh, sorry. My excitement must be clouding my ability to judge comedic hyperbole.\nLORELAI: So where'd you get the cat?\nKIRK: A lady had a bunch of them at the grocery store and Kirk seemed to take an instant liking to me.\nLORELAI: Kirk?\nKIRK: Yes?\nLORELAI: No, I mean, the cat's name is Kirk?\nKIRK: Yup.\nLORELAI: Weird coincidence or. . .\nKIRK: I named him Kirk.\nLORELAI: Isn't that confusing?\nKIRK: Not when you think about it.\n[Lorelai thinks about it]\nLORELAI: No, it's still confusing.\nKIRK: I like the name, and whenever I call Kirk's name, I obviously won't be calling myself.\nLORELAI: True.\nKIRK: Although when my mom calls for Kirk, that may be confusing. Maybe I can get her to say CatKirk when she's calling Kirk, and HumanKirk when she's calling me.\nRORY: That would keep it straight.\nKIRK: I'm glad I ran into you. See ya.\nLORELAI: See ya, HumanKirk.\nRORY: Bye HumanKirk.\n[Kirk walks away]\nRORY: He's always been a cat person, he's just never had a cat.\nLORELAI: Hm.\nCUT TO LUKE'S DINER\n[Lorelai and Rory walk in]\nLORELAI: Hey. Anywhere?\nLUKE: Anywhere.\nLORELAI: [to customer at table] Hm, would you mind moving?\nLUKE: I hate when you do that.\nLORELAI: It's my showstopper.\nLUKE: An empty table.\nLORELAI: Ah. You ready to order?\nRORY: I'm ready.\nLUKE: Don't bother, saw you coming, already ordered your Wednesday usual  the French dip, extra fries, the every-Wednesday cherry pie.\nRORY: Such service.\nLORELAI: Oh, and such a food rut we're in.\nRORY: Thank you, Luke.\nLUKE: I gotta get back to stuffing my turkey.\nLORELAI: Oh, honey, do you have time to do that and prep your Thanksgiving food?\nLUKE: Stop it.\nRORY: Here, here.\nLUKE: It's a tedious job.\nLORELAI: Well, what if we told you you could stuff one less?\nLUKE: What do you mean?\nLORELAI: We got jammed. Shanghaied by my mother and what with the other things we have going. . .well, too many commitments, not enough us.\nLUKE: So?\nRORY: We can't make it tomorrow.\nLUKE: Oh, okay, fine.\nLORELAI: It was beyond our control.\nLUKE: That's fine, whatever. I'll be right back. [walks away]\nLORELAI: Um, okay, I may be crazy, but he almost looked. . . .\nRORY: Disappointed.\nLORELAI: Yes, disappointed. We disappointed Luke.\nRORY: I didn't think it was possible.\nLORELAI: Our powers are greater than we know.\nRORY: He actually likes it when we come for Thanksgiving. All these years and we never knew.\nLORELAI: Hm, he's the Grinch and we're Cindy Lou Who.\nRORY: So Cindy Lou, what do we do?\nLORELAI: I got it.\n[Lorelai picks up her cell phone as Luke walks over]\nLORELAI: [on phone] Oh, uh, perfect. That works great. Okay, bye now. [hangs up] Sorry, I'm just clarifying the schedule for tomorrow. As luck has it, we can make it. We'll definitely be here.\nLUKE: It's okay.\nLORELAI: No, it's all cleared. That was my mom, and, uh, the time's just gonna work out just fine.\nLUKE: Really, you don't have to. I already stopped prepping the last turkey.\nLORELAI: Well, start prepping it again cause we are coming.\nLUKE: I don't want you to feel like you have to come.\nLORELAI: This is tiring.\nRORY: I can kneel behind him and you can push him over.\nLORELAI: It may come to that.\nLUKE: It won't be a hassle?\nLORELAI: It won't be a hassle.\nLUKE: You sure?\nLORELAI: We're coming, now go away and let us eat. Shoo, shoo.\n[Luke walks away]\nRORY: That was very nice.\nLORELAI: Well, I hate disappointing people.\nRORY: Okay, now, practical question. . . how are we going to eat four Thanksgiving dinners?\nLORELAI: How? Rory, what are we if not world champion eaters?\nRORY: It's too much food.\nLORELAI: It's not too much food. This is what we've been training for our whole lives. This is our destiny. This is our finest hour.\nRORY: Or final hour.\nLORELAI: No, no. Get inspired and tomorrow I guarantee you, we will be standing on the Olympic platform receiving our gold medals for eating. We are not Michelle Kwan-ing this.\nRORY: Okay, okay, four dinners.\nLORELAI: Yeah, we'll skip the rolls.\nRORY: That'll help. You know, we might wanna consider not eating much now in preparation for our finest hour. A little fasting so that we can enjoy more tomorrow, hm?\nLORELAI: Unnecessary.\nRORY: Yeah.\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[On Thanksgiving morning, Lorelai and Rory are walking toward the market]\nRORY: What's on the list?\nLORELAI: Flowers for everyone we're visiting and cranberry sauce for the Kims.\nRORY: Tums.\nLORELAI: You mean amateur pills?\nRORY: Just in case.\nLORELAI: Okay, Tums.\nRORY: I'll do the flowers.\nLORELAI: I'll do Doose's.\nRORY: Thank you.\n[Lorelai goes into the market. Jess walks up behind Rory]\nJESS: Hey there.\nRORY: Hey. [he kisses her, but Rory pulls away] Wait, stop.\nJESS: What?\nRORY: Stop.\nJESS: What are you doing?\nRORY: Come on. [Rory pulls him down the sidewalk a little, then kisses him]\nJESS: What was that?\nRORY: That was a kiss.\nJESS: What's with the relocation before the kiss?\nRORY: It's too early.\nJESS: Too early? Too early for what?\nRORY: For kissing like that.\nJESS: What's the rule, no kissing before noon?\nRORY: No, it's too early to do this here.\nJESS: Where, in the street?\nRORY: In the street, with people watching...\nJESS: What people?\nRORY: In front of Doose's.\nJESS: Ah, Doose's.\nRORY: We shouldn't flaunt it.\nJESS: But I want to flaunt it.\nRORY: It doesn't feel right.\nJESS: He's a big boy Rory.\nRORY: I know.\nJESS: It's not the first time a couple's broken up.\nRORY: It is for us.\nJESS: This is insane.\nRORY: Please, let's not flaunt it, please?\nJESS: For how long?\nRORY: Until it's comfortable.\nJESS: Before we're on Social Security?\nRORY: I promise, we can kiss secretly.\nJESS: Yeah, or we can wear Three Stooges masks all the time, that way no one will know who we are.\nRORY: I can be Curly.\nJESS: I'll be Moe.\nRORY: Probably too silly.\nJESS: Yeah, probably.\nRORY: This will get better over time, I promise. But until then, let's just play it cool.\nJESS: Hey, I'm Frank at the Sands.\nRORY: That's cool.\nCUT TO INSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET\n[Lorelai is shopping]\nLORELAI: Oh, hey, Kirk. Doing your holiday shopping?\nKIRK: Well, shopping, yes, and it is a holiday, but my shopping isn't holiday related, so technically no.\nLORELAI: Oh, what happened there?\nKIRK: Oh, nothing, just a little scratch.\nLORELAI: Looks like a big scratch. Wow, Bactine, Neosporin, Mercurochrome  what's with all the pharmacologicals?\nKIRK: Oh, well, Kirk and I are going through a little adjustment period, that's all.\nLORELAI: CatKirk?\nKIRK: It's no biggie, and this looks a lot worse than it is.\nLORELAI: Yeah, I can see that. So how'd it happen? Were you playing or something?\nKIRK: We haven't actually played yet. This happened when I accidentally walked into the room without announcing myself.\nLORELAI: Excuse me?\nKIRK: I've discovered Kirk likes my presence announced before I enter any room that he's in.\nLORELAI: You have to announce yourself?\nKIRK: Yeah, just a quick, Is it okay if I come in?' from the adjacent room. Otherwise, he gets a little testy.\nLORELAI: Hence the scratch.\nKIRK: It's just a small laceration. Again, no biggie.\nLORELAI: Kirk, he got your neck!\nKIRK: That was another mistake of mine. I put his food bowl down in front of him. He doesn't like that. Or she doesn't.\nLORELAI: She? I thought Kirk was a boy.\nKIRK: That was just a guess. He actually hasn't exposed his underside to me yet. Or hers.\nLORELAI: Well, here's hoping your cat exposes itself to you soon.\nKIRK: From your mouth to God's ears. See ya.\nLORELAI: See ya.\n[Lorelai walks over to Dean]\nLORELAI: Hi there.\nDEAN: Hi.\nLORELAI: So you pulled the Thanksgiving shift, huh?\nDEAN: Yeah, I get time and a half.\nLORELAI: Well, good, good. It's good to see you.\nDEAN: Same here. Um, so, I gotta work.\nLORELAI: Right, right. That Taylor's a dictator.\nDEAN: Yeah.\nLORELAI: Dean, wait. Um, look, we live in a teeny tiny little hamlet here. I mean, stick it in an envelope and we could mail the whole town for a buck-forty. It makes avoiding people tough and uncomfortable.\nDEAN: I know.\nLORELAI: I hate hiding from people, especially when I don't wanna hide from them. You were a pal. You were so good to Rory. You were the best first boyfriend a mother could've hoped for.\nDEAN: Thanks.\nLORELAI: It's okay to keep avoiding me if you want. I just wanted you to know that you don't need to, okay? Just because you and Rory broke up doesn't mean we did.\nDEAN: Good. That's good to hear.\nLORELAI: Well, Happy Thanksgiving.\nDEAN: Yeah, Happy Thanksgiving.\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Lorelai walks out of the diner with a bag. Rory is waiting with several bouquets of flowers]\nLORELAI: Aw, pretty!\nRORY: Yeah, good selection today. You get everything?\nLORELAI: And then some. Look.\nRORY: Chocolate turkeys, nice!\nLORELAI: I think they'll add a festive air.\nRORY: Definitely. So, was he in there?\nLORELAI: Yeah, he was.\nRORY: Good, good. I hope he's good. Did he seem good?\nLORELAI: He seemed good. He's getting time and a half.\nRORY: Good, good.\nLORELAI: So, let's go eat.\nRORY: And eat and eat.\nLORELAI: And eat and eat and eat.\nRORY: And eat and eat and eat and eat. . .\nLORELAI: And eat and eat and eat and eat. . .\nRORY: And eat some more.\nLORELAI: And eat and eat.\nCUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES\n[Mrs. Kim opens the door; Lorelai and Rory are on the porch]\nMRS. KIM: Ah, the Gilmores. Happy Thanksgiving.\nLORELAI: Happy Thanksgiving.\nRORY: Happy Thanksgiving.\nMRS. KIM: Come in.\nLORELAI: She's in a good mood this year.\nRORY: Downright chipper.\nLORELAI: So, um, Mrs. Kim, we, uh, we brought gifts.\nRORY: Flowers.\nLORELAI: And cranberry sauce, our little Thanksgiving tradition.\nMRS. KIM: Thank you, can never have too much.\nRORY: That's what we say.\nLORELAI: Plus, a chocolate turkey.\nMRS. KIM: What should I do with this?\nLORELAI: Oh, I don't know, let the kids share it.\nMRS. KIM: And then send a blank check to their dentist?\nLORELAI: They don't have to eat it, they can play with it.\nMRS. KIM: Play with chocolate? It's missing its head.\nLORELAI: Ooh, that one's ours. Here, this one has a head. There ya go.\nMRS. KIM: Okay. [walks away]\nLORELAI: My arms are too short to box with Mrs. Kim.\nRORY: The singing's already begun.\nLORELAI: Mm. Who's that playing guitar? He looks familiar.\nRORY: Oh my God, that's Lane's Dave.\nLORELAI: Oh, yeah, it is. He's all neat and tidy.\nRORY: He's gone corporate.\nLORELAI: He's gone Korean.\n[Lane walks by and sees them]\nLANE: Oh, hey, hi.\nRORY: Hey yourself. Hey, how'd you get your mom to let you \nLANE: Come on, girls, let's get you some punch. [leads them to the other room]\nRORY: What's going on?\nLANE: That is not Dave Rygalski.\nLORELAI: Oh, intrigue.\nRORY: Who is it?\nLANE: I mean, not the one that I'm in a band with. That is Dave Rygalski, local Christian guitar player that my mom and I met very briefly and innocently at the dance marathon, and that I coincidentally ran across again when I found his ad seeking Christian guitar accompaniment gigs up on our church bulletin board.\nLORELAI: Complicated.\nLANE: I even put the fake ad up at church and pretended to find it with my mom next to me.\nRORY: You're good.\nLORELAI: So, are you guys dating?\nLANE: We're laying the groundwork. If she gets to know him before we date and she approves of him, we won't have to hide anything.\nLORELAI: Right, except how you met.\nRORY: And who he really is.\nLANE: But other than that, it's completely fib-free. Shh, shh!\nMRS. KIM: Watch it. You break it, you buy it. Ten percent off for cousins, twenty percent off for nephews and nieces.\n[Lorelai, Rory, and Lane walk into the room where the food table is set up]\nLORELAI: Yung Kwan, good to see you. Hee Kim, hi. Oh, I love your hair. Su Nam, hi. Hi. Ho Kyung, Wan Kyu, great to see you, hi. Oh, Mrs. Kim, just a beautiful table, as always.\nMRS. KIM: Try the tofurkey. Turkey made from tofu.\nRORY: Oh, we definitely will.\nLORELAI: Mm.\nMRS. KIM: And meet the guitar player. Nice young man, big fan of tofurkey. David?\nDAVE: Yes.\nMRS. KIM: This is Rory Gilmore and Mrs. Gilmore.\nLORELAI: Hi, nice to meet you.\nDAVE: Oh, same here.\nRORY: I think I've seen you around town.\nDAVE: Yeah, that might be a possibility. Happy Thanksgiving.\nLORELAI: Same to you.\nMRS. KIM: Hymn 17 please.\nDAVE: Yes, ma'am.\nLORELAI: Wow, he seems like a very upright young man.\nMRS. KIM: Not a bad sight-reader either. [walks away]\nRORY: You're taking tofurkey?\nLORELAI: Uh huh, and some extra napkins to slip the tofurkey into when no one is looking and then toss them away.\nRORY: Very smart.\nLANE: Um, Mama, just a thought, but maybe we can take a break from the hymns while we eat?\nMRS. KIM: No break, he's paid to play. We can quit singing for now, but he should play soft in the background, okay?\nDAVE: Yeah. Yes, ma'am.\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Lorelai and Rory walk down the sidewalk]\nRORY: The best laid plans.\nLORELAI: Tell me about it.\nRORY: How do you feel?\nLORELAI: I ate tofurkey. How do you think I feel?\nRORY: Tofurkier.\nLORELAI: Drat that Mrs. Kim for not taking her eyes off me the whole time. . . it's like she was anticipating my napkin maneuver.\n[They walk up to Sookie's yard. Sookie is sitting at a picnic table, and a group of people is standing near the porch]\nLORELAI: Hi hon!\nRORY: Happy Thanksgiving.\nSOOKIE: Ah, thank you. Thank God, civilization has arrived.\nLORELAI: What's wrong?\nSOOKIE: What's wrong? Uh, do you not see what's going on here?\nLORELAI: What's that?\nSOOKIE: That is a vat of boiling oil.\nLORELAI: Really? Where's Quasimodo?\nSOOKIE: This is not a joking matter.\nRORY: What is the oil for?\nLORELAI: For pouring on visigoths.\nSOOKIE: Lorelai!\nLORELAI: When else am I gonna get to use my visigoth material?\nRORY: What's the oil for?\nSOOKIE: The turkey. My beautiful, expensive, organically grown turkey.\nLORELAI: I don't get it.\nSOOKIE: A couple of days ago, Jackson asked me if he could cook the turkey. I thought he was gonna roast it, stick a couple of onions around it, something simple. So I said yes, figuring that the minute he put it in the oven and leaves the kitchen, I can sneak in and give it a nice herb-bitter rub and stuff it with a pancetta-chestnut stuffing.\nLORELAI: Sure, cause he'd never notice that.\nSOOKIE: Exactly. Then the propane tank arrived, and the industrial burner, and the fifteen gallons of peanut oil. Then he springs it on me  I'm gonna deep-fry a turkey.\"\nLORELAI: Deep-fried turkey.\nRORY: Interesting.\nSOOKIE: I tried to talk him out of it, but I'd already promised and now he's excited about it.\nGUY 1: Hey, what's keeping Jackson? Is he on the pot or something?\nSOOKIE: Lots of precious memories in the making here.\nGUY 1: Hey Jackson, get your butt out here with that gobbler!\nSOOKIE: A gobbler.\nRORY: Maybe it won't be that bad.\nLORELAI: Yeah, deep-frying's kind of in now.\nSOOKIE: I don't care. You don't deep-fry turkey. Uh, filet of fish, yes. A batch of fries, yes. A donut, yes. Not turkey.\nGUY 1: Come on, let's get going!\nGUY 2: Yeah, we're hungry!\nEVERYONE: Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson. . .\n[Jackson pushes open the door and holds up the turkey]\nJACKSON: Did someone say. . .Jackson?\n[the crowd cheers]\nLORELAI: Wow, it's like Thunderdome in here.\nSOOKIE: He should've just driven it out on a monster truck. He's shamelessly catering to his demographic.\nJACKSON: Are you ready?\n[the crowd cheers]\nSOOKIE: Oh my God, I can't look.\nEVERYONE: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six. . .\nSOOKIE: Oh my God, they're counting down.\nEVERYONE: . . .five, four, three, two, one!\n[Jackson lowers the turkey into the vat]\nLORELAI: It's in the vat.\nSOOKIE: It's like a death in the family.\nLORELAI: Look at the bright side, Sookie. At least this took your mind off the dinner at the inn.\nSOOKIE: Oh my God, the inn. What if Bob decides to do something equally awful to the turkey at the inn? I have to call him.\nJACKSON: Oh, hey guys.\nLORELAI: Hey.\nJACKSON: Neat, huh? And it only takes forty minutes.\nLORELAI: Cool.\nJACKSON: How ya doing, hon?\nSOOKIE: Oh, fine, Sweets. [Lorelai hands her a beer] And keep them coming.\nCUT TO LUKE'S DINER\n[Lorelai and Rory walk in]\nLORELAI: Hey everybody.\nBABETTE: Oh, hey there dollfaces. Happy Thanksgiving.\nMOREY: Yeah, Happy Thanksgiving.\nRORY: Hey. [hands Luke a bouquet of flowers]\nLUKE: What's this?\nRORY: Flowers.\nLUKE: What do I do with them?\nLORELAI: Ugh, not this again.\nRORY: Put them in a vase with water.\nLUKE: I don't have a vase.\nLORELAI: You do this every year.\nLUKE: I don't have vases.\nLORELAI: Buy a vase.\nLUKE: But I don't need a vase cause I never have flowers.\nLORELAI: Except when we bring you flowers every year on Thanksgiving. Buy a vase.\nLUKE: Stop bringing me flowers.\nLORELAI: Stop bringing me flowers. I knew you were gonna say that because you say the same thing. We have this same exact conversation every year.\nLUKE: And every year you point that out.\nLORELAI: And every year you point that out.\nLUKE: And every year you point that out.\nRORY: And then every year we put the flowers on the counter and forget the ugliness ever happened.\nLORELAI: Well, at least we have a tradition.\nLUKE: Good. I'll be right back. That's our table over there.\nLORELAI: Hey Kirk. Oh my God!\nRORY: What happened?\nKIRK: I'm scratched over sixty percent of my body.\nLORELAI: Aw, CatKirk again?\nKIRK: Ow.\nLORELAI: Sorry.\nBABETTE: I'm so mad at that cat.\nMOREY: Very uncool cat.\nBABETTE: I love cats, but I love Kirk, too. It's pretty much fifty-fifty, and that's a high compliment, my friend.\nLORELAI: How did this happen?\nKIRK: Well, the tension of our standoff was unbearable, so I got on the floor and tried to play with him.\nLORELAI: It's a him?\nKIRK: I caught a peek.\nLORELAI: Go on.\nKIRK: I rolled this cute little ball of yarn over to him all nice and gentle. He tried to garrote me with it.\nLORELAI: Oh my God.\nMOREY: Very uncool.\nKIRK: Just grabbed two ends with his paws and came at me.\nRORY: But he doesn't have opposable thumbs.\nKIRK: He's beyond them. And he's smart. He knows things, sometimes before they happen.\nLORELAI: Get a hold of yourself, man.\nKIRK: You haven't heard the worst.\nRORY: Oh geez, there's worse?\nKIRK: When the attacks got particularly brutal, I had no choice but to strip naked and hide under water in the bathtub. I read that cats are afraid of water.\nBABETTE: They are, they are.\nKIRK: Kirk isn't. He found me, and he seemed to derive greater power from the water. That's when the bulk of the scratching happened.\nLORELAI: Well, then, I think it's good you're giving Kirk a little space right now. Just relax and enjoy your food.\nKIRK: I can't taste my food.\nLORELAI: Well, then, just try to relax.\nKIRK: Thanks.\n[Lorelai and Rory walk over to their table; Jess walks over]\nJESS: Hey.\nRORY: Hey. [they kiss]\nJESS: Hi.\nLORELAI: Hi, Happy Thanksgiving. So, are you joining us?\nJESS: Uh, sure, if that's okay.\nLORELAI: Yeah, sit, sit.\n[Luke and Caesar bring the plates over]\nJESS: God, I'm starved.\nLUKE: You could've eaten.\nJESS: You kept telling me not to eat.\nLUKE: I did not.\nJESS: You did, too. You said you were waiting for them.\nLORELAI: Aw, you didn't have to wait for us.\nLUKE: I wasn't waiting for you, it just worked out this way.\nJESS: Right.\nRORY: Looks great.\nLORELAI: Tasty.\nLUKE: Shouldn't we give thanks first?\nJESS: Thanks for what?\nLUKE: Well, that we're not Native Americans who got their land stolen in exchange for smallpox infested blankets.\nLORELAI: Amen.\nLUKE: So where you guys in your day?\nRORY: We hit the Kim's, we hit Sookie's, and we go to the grandparents from here.\nLORELAI: Full day.\nLUKE: Yeah. Well, you can skip eating this one if you want. Just have cokes or something, it's no big deal.\nLORELAI: No, no way, you're the main event today, my friend.\nLUKE: Oh, good.\nRORY: What's good are the yams.\nLORELAI: Definitely. Got some more marshmallows?\nLUKE: Yeah, I can grab some. Hey, refill some coffees. [Luke and Jess walk away]\nLORELAI: So, no offense, but lame-o kiss.\nRORY: What?\nLORELAI: You and Jess, like a couple chickens pecking at each other.\nRORY: Mind your own business.\nLORELAI: Well, it was right in front of me.\nRORY: So, I don't need a review.\nLORELAI: Sorry.\nRORY: I'm just not good with the public displays.\nLORELAI: You didn't have that problem with Dean.\nRORY: I know, but now I just feel like everybody's watching me.\nLORELAI: People are not watching you.\nRORY: You were watching me.\nLORELAI: I created you. It's biologically predetermined that I watch you.\nRORY: I just don't know how this whole second boyfriend thing is supposed to go.\nLORELAI: Well, he's your first second boyfriend. Give it time.\nRORY: The whole town got used to me with Dean, it's just weird.\nLORELAI: It'll get easier. You're gonna have hundreds of men in your life.\nRORY: Gee, thanks.\nLORELAI: Well, maybe not hundreds, but a couple, three, more. It'll get easier.\nRORY: I guess.\nLORELAI: Honey, they'll adjust to seeing you with Jess.\nRORY: And then there's Dean. What do I do about him?\nLORELAI: Well, you know, he'll be moving on, too.\nRORY: Oh, right, of course he will, yeah.\nBABETTE: Well, we're outta here.\nMOREY: Time to walk some of this off.\nBABETTE: Oh, we'd have to walk to China to walk all of it off. Which way's China?\nLORELAI: Thataway. Have a good night.\nBABETTE: Thanks. By the way, that was some half-assed kiss you two had. You gotta give it a little something, honey.\nLORELAI: Bye Babette. Bye Morey.\nBABETTE: Bye.\nRORY: The whole town is watching.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE\n[Lorelai and Rory walk up to the front door]\nRORY: You ready for this?\nLORELAI: Of course.\nRORY: Even with the Cold War?\nLORELAI: That's been going on for thirty-four years? I can manage.\nRORY: It's been a bit colder these past few weeks.\nLORELAI: Oh no, I'm fine, you know why? Because in two hours  and I do plan on extricating us from here in exactly two hours  the night will be over and I won't have to see them again until next year. Oh, start your stopwatch.\n[Emily opens the door]\nEMILY: Hello.\nRORY: Hi Grandma. Happy Thanksgiving.\nEMILY: Thank you, Rory. Happy Thanksgiving, Lorelai.\nLORELAI: Happy Thanksgiving. [mumbles to Rory] One hour, fifty-nine minutes, and forty seconds.\n[they walk into the house]\nLORELAI: Oh, wow, it's a piano player.\nEMILY: That's Brad. I found him at Nordstrom's.\nLORELAI: Was he on sale?\nEMILY: I thought a little background music would add a nice touch. He knows every song ever written.\nLORELAI: Free Bird! Hi Brad.\nEMILY: Lorelai, please. Now come along, everyone's here. [they walk to living room] We're all here.\nRICHARD: Oh, good. Happy Thanksgiving, Rory.\nRORY: Happy Thanksgiving, Grandpa.\nRICHARD: Lorelai.\nLORELAI: Dad.\nRICHARD: These are our guests, Natalie and Douglas Swope.\nEMILY: You two have met.\nLORELAI: Yes, at the auction.\nNATALIE: Good to see you again.\nLORELAI: Yes.\nDOUGLAS: Nice to meet you.\nLORELAI: Yes, you, too.\nRORY: Same here.\nRICHARD: And this is our international contingent, Claude and Monique Clemenceau. They're just in from France.\nLORELAI: Ah, Clemenceau, huh, I'd have guessed Spain.\nCLAUDE: Hello, how are you? [kisses Lorelai's hand]\nLORELAI: Oh, ooh.\nMONIQUE: Hello.\nRICHARD: Monique, voici ma fille et ma petite fille.\nMONIQUE: Ah. Elle sont si jolies.\nCLAUDE: My Monique speaks only French, so please excuse the inconvenience.\nLORELAI: Oh, no, that's fine. I love French.\nCLAUDE: She really wants to learn English, perhaps tonight will inspire her. [to Monique] Je leur ai dit que tu voulais à prendre l'anglais.\nMONIQUE: L'anglais, oui, je veux à prendre, mais je suis tellement parasseuse.\nRICHARD: Ah, ça prends de temps, Monique. Ah, t'en fais pas.\nMONIQUE: Merci.\nRICHARD: Oh, no no no. That's why I love it when the Clemenceaus visit. It gives me the opportunity to haul out my rusty French.\nCLAUDE: Your French is wonderful, Richard. It always has been.\nRICHARD: Aw, non, tu es tres gentil. Please, sit, sit, sit.\nCLAUDE: Merci. So, Rory, you speak French at all?\nRORY: Just a tiny little bit.\nCLAUDE: Un tout petite peu?\nRORY: Oui, un tout petite peu.\nCLAUDE: And you, my dear?\nLORELAI: Even less. Uh, voulez vous couchez avec moi ce soir? That's about it.\nRICHARD: Lorelai.\nEMILY: Oh my God.\nLORELAI: It's just a joke.\nRICHARD: Asking my friend to go to bed with you is a joke?\nRORY: It's a song.\nLORELAI: It's just a joke, Dad.\nCLAUDE: Oh, voici c'est un chanson du pop. It's a pop song, ah, Monique. . . I did not know that.\nMONIQUE: Lady Marmalade.\nCLAUDE: It's very rich. It's very, very funny.\nLORELAI: Oh, well, thank you.\nCLAUDE: You need a drink, oui?\nLORELAI: Very astute, Claude. Martini with a twist, Dad.\nRICHARD: All right.\nDOUGLAS: Is this your first American Thanksgiving, Claude?\nCLAUDE: It is, it is. I've seen it in the movies. People seem to eat and eat and eat until they can't eat anymore.\nLORELAI: That's about it.\nNATALIE: It's about giving thanks, gets you thinking about the good things.\nDOUGLAS: We have a lot to give thanks for in this country.\nEMILY: Definitely.\nCLAUDE: Me, I start each day giving thanks for three things  Cuban cigars, French champagne, and gorgeous women. And I must give extra thanks for the extraordinary group here tonight.\nLORELAI: Douglas, Richard, leave us, won't you?\nRICHARD: What?\nEMILY: Just another joke.\nCLAUDE: Oh, I missed another joke?\nNATALIE: You have your mother's wit.\nEMILY: Sometimes I wish she'd give it back.\nDOUGLAS: Emily mentioned that you were coming from another function?\nCLAUDE: No, this is your second dinner?\nRORY: Fourth, actually.\nNATALIE: Fourth?\nRICHARD: Oh, thank you for fitting us in, Lorelai.\nLORELAI: Don't worry, Dad.

Do we carve a crouton, then have them taken away?\nEMILY: No, no ceremony.\nRORY: Salad's great, Grandma.\nEMILY: I'm surprised you can eat at this point, even salad.\nRORY: There's still room.\nLORELAI: And if there isn't room, we'll add on. I know a good contractor.\nCLAUDE: She's like your Jerry Lewis. She's very, very funny.\nNATALIE: Rory, did your grandmother say you were a high school senior?\nRORY: Mmhmm.\nNATALIE: So you're going through this horrible period of applying to college.\nRORY: It's not so horrible.\nRICHARD: She's got it pretty well covered.\nLORELAI: That's right.\nNATALIE: All your applications are in?\nRORY: I've applied.\nDOUGLAS: We have a grandson your age, he's going through hell.\nNATALIE: He's already been turned down for early admission to Stanford, his dream.\nDOUGLAS: Took it pretty hard.\nNATALIE: Children put so much stress on themselves these days.\nRORY: It's pretty stressful.\nNATALIE: He's waiting to hear from his backups.\nCLAUDE: I have a grandson who lives with his mother in Orlando, you know, he's going through a very similar thing, poor boy.\nEMILY: How do they like Orlando, Claude?\nCLAUDE: Well, it's all Mickey Mouse this and Mickey Mouse that, you know. They want to die.\nEMILY: That's too bad.\nNATALIE: Where did you apply, dear?\nRORY: Harvard.\nDOUGLAS: No word yet?\nRORY: I'm not supposed to hear back for awhile.\nDOUGLAS: Where else?\nRORY: Where else?\nDOUGLAS: Where else did you apply? Your alternates?\nNATALIE: We're so curious, it's like we've been going through this ourselves.\nRORY: Well, I'm pretty much counting on Harvard.\nDOUGLAS: Well, you didn't apply to just Harvard, did you?\nRORY: Well, no.\nLORELAI: No?\nNATALIE: Am I prying?\nRORY: No.\nLORELAI: We applied elsewhere?\nDOUGLAS: You can't just apply to one place.\nNATALIE: Chilton wouldn't allow that.\nLORELAI: Is that true?\nRORY: Pretty much.\nLORELAI: Why didn't you tell me that?\nRORY: I was going to.\nNATALIE: You have to be safe.\nCLAUDE: My grandson  six schools.\nDOUGLAS: Same with Dustin.\nLORELAI: Where else did you apply?\nRORY: Just at some other schools.\nDOUGLAS: Well, if you're aiming at Harvard, that would be Princeton, Yale, maybe Vassar, Wesleyan.\nCLAUDE: Certainly Yale because of Richard's connections, yes?\nNATALIE: I would assume so.\nRORY: Those are the kinds of places, yup.\nLORELAI: The kinds of places or the places? Rory?\nRORY: Princeton. . . um, Yale.\nLORELAI: Yale?\nRICHARD: Yes?\nLORELAI: Yale, Dad?\nRICHARD: Oh, this is the first I'm hearing about it, Lorelai.\nLORELAI: Oh, bull.\nRORY: Mom.\nEMILY: Lorelai.\nLORELAI: You did this.\nRICHARD: I haven't discussed this awful subject since the debacle at the campus.\nLORELAI: You forced her hand.\nRICHARD: I did nothing of the sort.\nRORY: Mom, wait.\nLORELAI: You made it seem like you'd be deeply hurt if she didn't apply to Yale, and she's very sensitive, so that's as good as forcing her hand.\nEMILY: Lorelai, really.\nLORELAI: You wanted her to go to Yale instead of Harvard, didn't you?\nRICHARD: Well, that wasn't a secret.\nCLAUDE: Lorelai ne veut pas que Rory aille à Yale.\nRICHARD: Je suis désolé de ce qui ce passe ici.\nLORELAI: Stick to English, Dad.\nRORY: Grandpa didn't force my hand.\nLORELAI: Honey, you weren't aware he was doing it.\nRICHARD: She is not a puppet, Lorelai.\nRORY: I needed a backup.\nLORELAI: But why Yale?\nRORY: I could live at home.\nLORELAI: You.\nEMILY: What?\nLORELAI: Well, you got to her. That was your thing.\nNATALIE: I'm afraid we started this.\nEMILY: This is not your doing, Natalie.\nRICHARD: Encore une fois, je suis désolé.\nEMILY: I never spoke to Rory about that.\nLORELAI: I don't believe you.\nRORY: I figured it out on my own, Mom.\nLORELAI: You're saying there have been no conversations, no emails?\nRORY: I can read a map.\nLORELAI: This is unbelievable.\nRICHARD: And past indelicate. We have guests.\nLORELAI: Yes, I'm sorry, I apologize, I'm sorry you have to see this.\nEMILY: This is paranoia, Lorelai. There's been no conspiring.\nLORELAI: I'm not being paranoid, Mom. For seventeen years, she was going to Harvard, and now all of a sudden, she's applied to Yale and she's mimicking everything you say. This is just crazy. [leaves the room]\nCLAUDE: Elle a dit que, c'est de la folie.'\nEMILY: Excuse me, please.\nCUT TO BACK PATIO\n[Lorelai is standing outside as Emily walks out the back door]\nEMILY: It's freezing out here.\nLORELAI: It's Jamaica compared to in there.\nEMILY: It's just an alternative to Harvard, a backup. It changes nothing.\nLORELAI: No, no.\nEMILY: Lorelai.\nLORELAI: Mom, I don't wanna talk.\nEMILY: Do you believe we had nothing to do with this?\nLORELAI: Just for a second, Mom, please. Just let me digest this for a second. All this Yale stuff. . .agh!\nEMILY: You can't even let Rory have one piece of our lives, even if it's her choice. You hate us that much.\n[Lorelai doesn't respond. Emily walks back into the house]\nCUT TO THE KIM'S HOUSE\n[The last of the guests are leaving]\nMRS. KIM: Goodbye, drive safe.\nGUEST: Thank you. [leaves]\nLANE: Excellent Thanksgiving, Mama.\nMRS. KIM: I think people had fun.\nLANE: And it was nice of you to only charge half price on the chair that Yung Hee broke.\nMRS. KIM: That was my cost.\nLANE: That why it was nice.\nDAVE: Well, I guess I'll be going.\nMRS. KIM: All right. You did a good job. Thank you for your time, David.\nDAVE: Oh, you're welcome, Mrs. Kim. I enjoyed it.\nLANE: Yes, thank you.\nDAVE: You're welcome.\nMRS. KIM: Here. Some rice, spinach, lots of tofurkey.\nDAVE: Great, thanks.\nMRS. KIM: And something for your time.\nDAVE: That's very nice, thank you. Happy Thanksgiving.\nMRS. KIM: Goodbye.\n[Dave leaves]\nMRS. KIM: Keep clearing. I'm going to start on the kitchen.\nLANE: Okay. Oh, Mama, look. Dave's bible. He forgot it. He's gonna need this, too. I'll run it out to him.\nMRS. KIM: Wait.\nLANE: We're gonna miss him.\nMRS. KIM: Let me see that. [takes the bible and reads the inside cover] This bible belongs to God, but is being used by Dave Rygalski.' [hands the bible back to Lane] Go on.\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Lane rushes down the sidewalk; Dave is waiting by a tree]\nDAVE: Wow, you run really quiet.\nLANE: Sorry, I'm sorry about everything.\nDAVE: What?\nLANE: The whole night. I had no idea she'd make you play five straight hours without a break.\nDAVE: It's okay.\nLANE: Your hands must be dead.\nDAVE: They're just a little numb. But I've got these Kurt Cobain calluses now, how cool is that?\nLANE: But this whole thing, this whole charade, the fake flier and everything, it was too much.\nDAVE: Lane, it's fine. And that flier  I've gotten like three other calls for paying gigs. I should be paying you a commission.\nLANE: Oh, that's not necessary.\nDAVE: And check it out  twenty bucks.\nLANE: Wow, she liked you.\nDAVE: We'll put it towards our first real date.\nLANE: Really? After all this  the marathon hymns, the weak punch, the crabby Koreans, you still wanna go out on a date with me?\n[Dave nods, then kisses her]\nDAVE: I've gotta go. . . but I'm gonna call you tomorrow.\nCUT TO SIDEWALK\n[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street]\nRORY: Are you mad?\nLORELAI: No, I'm not mad.\nRORY: You seem mad.\nLORELAI: I'm not mad.\nRORY: What are you feeling?\nLORELAI: I wouldn't know how to word it.\nRORY: Try.\nLORELAI: See, my head knows that whichever one of these places you go, Harvard, Princeton, Yale. . .it's gonna be great. It's gonna be awesome, and you're gonna come out on the other side an even more amazing you. But I just wish my head could sit down and have a chat with that gnawing feeling in my gut that's there every time my parents get involved in anything and tell it, it's gonna be okay.\nRORY: It's gonna be okay.\nLORELAI: Nice try.\n[They walk across Sookie's front yard]\nJACKSON: What else are we putting in the pot? Come on, let's think of something. Uh, a raspberry, a deep-fried raspberry. How bout a rasquat?\nGUY: Cake!\nJACKSON: Cake! Deep-fried cake!\nGUY: Dibs on the deep-fried cake!\nJACKSON: You haven't even eaten your deep-fried biscotti.\n[Lorelai and Rory sit down at the picnic table with Sookie]\nLORELAI: Hey, Sookie.\nSOOKIE: Ah, hi there.\nLORELAI: Are you okay?\nSOOKIE: This tastes good.\nLORELAI: Yeah, it looks like they're deep-frying \nSOOKIE: Everything.\nLORELAI: Huh.\nSOOKIE: Vegetables, mashed potatoes, butter, pickles, salt, a napkin.\nRORY: And yet, you're very serene.\nLORELAI: Uh, you're practically floating.\nSOOKIE: Well, you caught me at a good time, ladies. I've already gone through the five stages of grieving. Denial, anger. . .I don't remember these two, but they were served on the rocks with salt! Now, I'm just happily enscotched in acceptance. Enscotched. . .\nRORY: Ensconced?\nSOOKIE: Ensconced  that's it! I do believe I heard Phil suggest throwing Junior in.\nLORELAI: Junior?\nSOOKIE: His nephew.\nLORELAI: Whoa.\nSOOKIE: I chimed in on that one.\nLORELAI: What happened over there?\nSOOKIE: Mm, about a half-hour ago they set the lawn on fire.\nLORELAI: Ah.\nSOOKIE: But Phil says it's okay and everything cause it'll grow back twice as lush. Though that's what he said when he broke my salad bowl that I brought back from Belgium. That'll maybe grow back, too, huh? [laughs] Phil is a riot. Am I crying or laughing?\nLORELAI: Laughing.\nSOOKIE: Good.\n[Rory's pager goes off]\nLORELAI: Who's that?\nRORY: It's Lane. It just says bible kiss bible'.\nLORELAI: What does that mean?\nRORY: I have no idea. Good band name, though.\nLORELAI: Honey, we should get going? You gonna be okay?\nSOOKIE: I'm Sookie.\nLORELAI: Yeah, I know, but you're gonna be okay, right? You'll go to bed soon.\nSOOKIE: Unless they deep-fried it.\nLORELAI: I'm sure they haven't. Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.\n[Lorelai and Rory start walking away]\nRORY: Poor thing.\nLORELAI: Oh, she may not remember any of it.\nJACKSON: Deep-fried shoe!\nGUY: Deep-fried shoe!\n[Everyone cheers]\nCUT TO FRONT OF LUKE'S DINER\n[Luke and Jess walk out of the diner; Jess is carrying a garbage bag]\nJESS: Get more trash cans.\nLUKE: I don't need more.\nJESS: You make me run around town for a place to dump this.\nLUKE: Just dump it in one of Taylor's bins. It gets it out of here and it'll drive Taylor crazy. It's a win-win.\nLORELAI: Hi guys.\nLUKE: We're out of food.\nLORELAI: Oh, please, we're not eating for a year.\nRORY: Or til tomorrow morning.\nLORELAI: Whichever comes first. Hi Saint Nick.\nJESS: Tell him he needs to get more trash cans.\nLUKE: Just go.\nLORELAI: You got any coffee?\nLUKE: That I've got. Come on in. Hey, did I see flames coming from Sookie's place about a half-hour ago?\nLORELAI: Yeah, why?\n[Lorelai and Luke walk into the diner. Rory follows Jess down the sidewalk]\nJESS: I still say you should get more tra. . .\n[Rory kisses him]\nRORY: Hi.\nJESS: Hi.\nRORY: Later.\n[Rory walks away. As Jess carries the trash bag down the street, he finds Dean standing on the sidewalk]\nDEAN: Nothing to say?\nJESS: Guess not.\nDEAN: That's funny, you usually have something to say.\nJESS: Guess I'm all talked out.\nDEAN: What's the matter, Jess? Why you walking away?\nJESS: It's getting a little West Side Story here, Dean, and I gotta warn you, my dancing skills are not up to snuff.\nDEAN: But now's your chance, there's no one else around.\nJESS: Go home. Cool off.\nDEAN: Come on, make one of your Boy Scout references, or a good Farmer John joke. I got my Doose's Market apron with me  you want me to put it on, give you a little inspiration? I don't get it, what happened  you suddenly like me now?\nJESS: Oh yeah, I was just about to invite you camping.\nDEAN: Good, okay, now we're getting somewhere.\nJESS: I'm not gonna fight you, Dean.\nDEAN: Why?\nJESS: Cause if I fight you, Rory's gonna think it's my fault, so just forget it, okay? Just forget it. Go home. Let it rest.\nDEAN: So Rory's got a nice little hold on you now, huh?\nJESS: Geez. Don't do that.\nDEAN: How does it feel?\nJESS: It feels like I'm with Rory and you're not.\nDEAN: You know, when all this happened with you and me and Rory, I figured I'd just stay out of everyone's way, that that would be easiest. But now, I'm looking at you and I'm thinking, I'm gonna run from him? The Glad Man. This is my town, I'm not hiding. And I don't have be remotely calm around you anymore, and I like that feeling. I like it a lot. Happy Thanksgiving, Jess.\nCUT TO INSIDE THE DINER\n[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the counter]\nLUKE: So, how did the four dinners work out? You guys must feel more stuffed than you've ever been.\nLORELAI: I don't know. Is this more stuffed than the great Six Flags hot dog consumption of 99?\nRORY: No, or the taffy binge of '97.\nLORELAI: Not by a long shot. See, we didn't eat at my parents because of the upset, so we really had three dinners, not four.\nRORY: Which means. . .\nLORELAI: What?\nRORY: We didn't have to skip rolls.\nLORELAI: Oh yeah. Hey, do you have any rolls left?\nLUKE: No. Come on.\nLORELAI: Just a little something for the walk home.\n[Luke hands her a bag of rolls]\nLUKE: I don't see how you do it.\nLORELAI: Well, you're not us, are ya? Night Luke.\nRORY: Night Luke.\nLUKE: Night.\nCUT TO OUTSIDE\n[Lorelai and Rory walk past the gazebo]\nLORELAI: This has been a nice Thanksgiving.\nRORY: Very.\nLORELAI: Nicer for some than others though.\nRORY: Yeah.\nLORELAI: Night Kirk!\n[Kirk is trying to go to sleep on a bench in the gazebo]\nKIRK: Night.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

And just who might you be?\nHook: I'm the man who's going to relieve you of that chest full of gold you are transporting.\nKnight: You and what army?\nHook: Well, I'm glad you asked.\n(Lights are lit.)\nHook: Your choice. Save your lives or the gold.\nKnight: Retreat!\n(The knight leaves.)\nHook: Smee?! Those arrows took a lot longer to light than discussed.\nSmee: It wasn't easy lighting all of them by ourselves, captain. Maybe if we had an actual army...\nHook: And share in the spoils? I think not.\nSmee: I got to say, it's good to be at your side again, sir, and... Not as a rat.\nHook: Well... that's a lovely side effect of the curse breaking for you, I'd imagine.\nSmee: I did like the mobility, but being a human is good, too.\nHook: What did I tell you, mates? You don't need a ship to be a pirate.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(At the tavern.)\nHook: One more, one more!\n(Oh!)\nHook: To the most clever, dastardly band of pirates to ever set sa... Stride on the open roads!\nSmee: To captain Hook!\nEverybody: Hey!\nSmee: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! The boys and I chipped in...\nHook: Mm-hmm.\nSmee: And got you something.\nHook: Oh. Mr. Smee. How did you know?\nSmee: Enjoy. To captain Hook!\nEverybody: To Hook!\nSmee: Come on. One more.\n(Outside the tavern. Hook gives the prostitute some money.)\nThe prostitute: I don't... Understand. Your men took care of me.\nHook: And tomorrow, you shall tell them that you had a grand time. Good night.\n(Hook is walking in the street and he is hit by Ariel.)\nHook: Aah.\nAriel: Move, and I'll slit your throat.\nHook: Not a good plan for you. I'm guessing you don't know who I am.\nAriel: I know exactly who you are, Captain Hook.\nHook: Well, then, I'm at a disadvantage.\nAriel: My name's Ariel. And you're gonna pay for what you've done.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Storybrooke ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(At Charming Family's loft.)\nDavid: I've seen enemy battle plans that were easier to decode than this.\nEmma: Let me see. All right, it says \"take screws 'E' with washers 'D' \"through bar 'C' using wrench 'F, '\" which is... Not provided.\nMary Margaret: Why don't you just call Marco? He's really good at this sort of thing.\nEmma & David: No!\nDavid: No. We're fine.\nMary Margaret: Should we even be doing this? Ever since the showdown between Regina and the Wicked Witch, we haven't seen Zelena or Gold at all. Shouldn't we be focusing on her next move?\nEmma: We are. We just can't stop living.\nDavid: And this crib is a statement. We're not gonna lose another baby.\n(Regina comes in.)\nRegina: And, thanks to me, you won't. I'm finished.\nDavid: So? Did it work? Were you able to put up a new protection spell?\nRegina: One that can't be undone by blood magic, which means Zelena won't be able to put her hands on that baby.\nMary Margaret: Any idea why she would want to?\nRegina: The number of spells involving baby parts would surprise you. That greenie is clearly one twisted witch. But as long as we're in here, we're safe.\nEmma: That's useless. I think we need to stop playing defence and start taking the fight to her.\nRegina: Did you not see how I barely outwitted her yesterday? She has magic... Powerful magic.\nEmma: I have magic, too. You've seen me use it. I just can't always control it. But if we teamed up, if you... Taught me...\nRegina: Now, why does this feel so familiar?\nEmma: I'm ready this time.\nRegina: Okay. But if we do this, we do this my way. This isn't drinking stale coffee at a stakeout or... Whatever you did as a bail bondsperson. This is a way of life. You have to fully commit to it.\nEmma: Not a problem.\nRegina: Meet me at my vault in two hours.\n(Regina leaves.)\nEmma: And no complaining. I'm doing this. It's the only way. And yes, I will be careful.\nMary Margaret: We know.\nDavid: Don't worry. We'll watch Henry when he gets back from the store.\nEmma: Actually... I'm not sure that's the best idea.\nMary Margaret: What? What is it?\nEmma: Well, you guys are tired. You need to rest.\nMary Margaret: I'm pregnant. I'm not sick with the flu.\nEmma: Yeah, I know. It's just, um... Well, it's... \"Cradle cap.\" Last time you guys had him, you overwhelmed him with baby tips. He's 12. He's doesn't want to talk about pregnancies. It's not fun.\nMary Margaret: Oh, we're fun.\nEmma: Well, I'm just saying maybe Henry disagrees.\nMary Margaret: No!\nEmma: He'll get there. You got to remember, he doesn't know who you are.\nDavid: Well, if we're not fun, who is?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Hook is waiting for Smee at the harbour.)\nSmee: Captain Hook. Captain.\nHook: It's about time, Mr. Smee. You know how much I abhor waiting. What is it that's so urgent?\nSmee: It's just, um, me and the men were talking about how we haven't seen much of you since we all ended up back here.\nHook: Is there a point to that rather odd observation?\nSmee: What's keeping us from crewing up again hitting the high seas, getting back to pirating?\nHook: You mean other than being attacked and turned into flying monkeys? Have you forgotten? There's no safe passage out of this town. You've already been a rodent, Mr. Smee. Does life as a simian interest you, as well?\nSmee: Of course there's safe passage. We could outrun them.\nHook: Not with that torso of yours.\nSmee: If we had a fast enough ship. The Jolly Roger, for instance. You still haven't told me whether you found her during the time none of us can remember.\nHook: What happened during that time isn't important.\nSmee: Because you remember. Is our ship okay? What... What happened to it?\nHook: My ship. All you need to know, Mr. Smee, is that the Jolly Roger isn't here. So there will be no outrunning of anything.\nSmee: I mean, what if we found another ship? Any one of these...\nHook: Mr. Smee, I've tried letting you down easy. Now let me be more direct. I have no intention of leaving this town.\nSmee: Captain, I agree with you This place has its bright spots. I have never tried anything quite like frozen yogurt before. But the Wicked Witch is here. And with that sort of danger, what possible reason do you have to stay?\nHook: My reasons are my own. Question them again at your peril.\n(Emma and Henry arrive.)\nSmee: Sir.\nEmma: Wait here, okay? Didn't he used to be a rat?\nHook: Aye. In many ways, he still is. To what do I owe the pleasure, Swan?\nEmma: Um... I was wondering if you could take care of Henry again.\nHook: If you want to get close to me, you just need to ask. There's no need to use the lad as an excuse.\nEmma: Why am I not surprised you're making this about you? I need your help, 'cause Regina needs to train me in magic. We think together, we might be able to defeat the Wicked Witch.\nHook: That's the first reasonable plan I've heard since this all began. Magic is a part of you, Swan. Don't forget... I was there when Cora tried to steal your heart. I saw the power inside of you. It's about time you embraced it. It's what makes you the Saviour.\nEmma: I'm not embracing anything. I need to learn magic to defeat Zelena and make sure everyone here is safe. After that, I'm done.\nHook: Done with what, exactly?\nEmma: He doesn't belong here... Not anymore. He belongs in the real world, in New York, and the life that he remembers. It was good. And it didn't involve vile villains.\nHook: What about the life you remember? You can't just pretend like this never happened. Trust me. I spent the last year trying to do just that... Return to the person I used to be... And it didn't work.\nEmma: Why? What happened over the last year that you're not telling me?\nHook: It matters not. Just take it from me just this once. No matter how much you wish you could go back to your old life... You can't.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Mary Margaret and David are walking on the beach.)\nDavid: We can't just sit back and do nothing.\nMary Margaret: You're right. We can be as fun as... As any pirate captain.\nDavid: Exactly. Henry obviously did a lot of growing up in the past year. We just have to... Adjust accordingly.\nMary Margaret: What's going on?\n(A group surrounds Ariel.)\nSomebody: Does anyone know what happened?\nSomebody: She just washed up onshore.\nMary Margaret: Who did? Who's here? Ariel?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(On the beach.)\nMary Margaret: Where have you been? We thought you'd been turned into a monkey.\nAriel: A monkey? No. I'm a girl that turns into a fish.\nDavid: Yeah, we... We know. What happened to you?\nAriel: I've been under the sea... Searching. I've travelled to every known realm looking for Prince Eric.\nDavid: So he's missing? For how long?\nAriel: After Pan failed, I woke up here, like everybody else. I... I couldn't find him. I didn't understand what happened until I overheard everybody saying that we had all gone to the Enchanted Forest and been there for a year without knowing it.\nDavid: So you still don't know what happened to him?\nAriel: That's why I came back here. I thought maybe I'd overlooked something, that he'd be here, but... Obviously, you haven't seen him.\nMary Margaret: We're sorry. We've been trying to piece together what happened. All we know is that we're up against Regina's sister, the Wicked Witch.\nAriel: Do you think that she might be responsible for Prince Eric's disappearance?\nMary Margaret: Without our memories, it's impossible to know everything.\nDavid: Maybe for us, but what about Hook?\nAriel: The pirate?\nMary Margaret: Yes. He wasn't part of the witch's curse. He has his memories. Maybe he can... I don't know... Shed some light on what happened to Prince Eric.\nAriel: Well, do you think he'd help me?\nMary Margaret: He helped us save Henry. I don't know why not.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Enchanted Forest - Past Year ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(In the street.)\nHook: Fear of adding insult to injury, would you mind catching me up on your particular grievance?\nAriel: You kidnapped Prince Eric, and you're gonna return him to me. Now on your feet!\nHook: Kidnapping a prince does sound like something I would do, but... I'm afraid you've got the wrong pirate. Or should I say the wrong pirate has you?\nAriel: Go ahead... Kill me. But I still know you're lying. One of Eric's men escaped, so I know the ship that took him was yours... the Jolly Roger.\nHook: The Jolly Roger? Are you certain? Answer me!\nAriel: You really didn't take him.\nHook: What else do you know about who's captaining my ship? Did that man tell you anything else?!\nAriel: Only that he was able to escape with a weapon that he stole from the armoury... The dagger that's against my throat.\n(Hook watches the dagger, he laughs and leaves.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Mr Smee is sleeping in the tavern. Hook enters.)\nHook: Rise and shine, you bilge rats! No offense, Mr. Smee.\nSmee: None taken. I keep dreaming of cheese. What is it?\nHook: I know who has the Jolly Roger, and we're gonna take her back.\nSmee: Whose funeral shall we be attending, sir?\nHook: Black Beard.\nSmee: Black Beard? But... He's the most cutthroat pirate ever to hoist a sail. Uh... After you, of course.\nHook: Which will make it all the more satisfying when I take my ship back and make him walk her lovely plank.\nSmee: Let's not be hasty. We've been having fun robbing carriages. Getting rich from it, too. M... M... Maybe we should forget about the Jolly Roger. You said it yourself. We don't need a ship to be...\nHook: She's not just a ship.\nSmee: I'm fairly certain she is.\nHook: She's more than that. I haven't been myself since we've returned. I should have realized the reason why. It's because I don't have her.\nSmee: \"Her\"? You talk about the vessel as though she's a woman.\nHook: Women come and go, Mr. Smee, but a pirate's life... It's forever.\nSmee: Still, captain... I doubt we could even find Black Beard...\nHook: Don't be a coward! I know where he moors his vessels. It's less than a day's trek. And then I'll have my ship again.\nAriel: And I will have my prince.\nHook: Few people have held a dagger to my throat and lived to tell the tale. I'd leave before I change my mind.\nAriel: No. I've crossed paths with enough pirates to know your code. Any valuable information a pirate captain ascertains shall be compensated in equal favour.\nSmee: I think she's right.\nAriel: So... When do we leave?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Storybrooke ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Hook and Henry are at Granny's Diner. They dice. Hook always wins.)\nHook: You want to know the secret to winning?\nHenry: Practice?\nHook: No, my boy. Loaded dice.\nHenry: That's cheating.\nHook: Only if you get caught.\nHenry: I think it's cheating either way.\nHook: Point is, you win. \"Practice,\" huh?\n(David, Mary Margaret and Ariel enter in the Diner. Hook goes see them.)\nDavid: Uh, Hook, this is a friend of ours... Ariel. She's looking for someone who didn't return to Storybrooke with the rest of us.\nAriel: He's from a maritime kingdom, and he loved to sail. Perhaps... You came across him on the high seas? His name's Prince Eric.\nHook: Sorry, lass. I wish I could help, but I've never heard of him.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(At Regina's vault.)\nRegina: Don't touch anything.\nEmma: How am I supposed to learn magic if I can't touch anything?\nRegina: The same way I did with Rumple. We're going to create a solid foundation first and then build your skills from the ground up. I said \"don't touch.\" So, while we're here, who's looking after Henry? The Un-Charmings?\nEmma: Actually, Hook is.\nRegina: Well, those two have been spending a lot of time together lately.\nEmma: Hook's good with Henry, and Henry likes him.\nRegina: He's prone to violence, impulsive, and has a hook for a hand. What about him would a 12-year-old boy not like?\nEmma: I trust him. He brought me back to Storybrooke, and he didn't have to.\nRegina: Oh. Of course he brought you back.\nEmma: What's that supposed to mean?\nRegina: Seriously? You're going to pretend everyone doesn't see the yearning looks and doe-y eyes?\nEmma: I don't yearn.\nRegina: Well, maybe. But he does. Let's start with roots for incantations.\n(Regina shows Emma her mother's book of magic.)\nEmma: Are you kidding me right now? What language is this... Spanish?\nRegina: We're not making tapas. We're making magic. It's Elvish. Well, half Elvish.\nEmma: I'm never gonna get this. Is this how Rumple taught you? Just think about your training. What other methods did he use?\nRegina: Rumple was a bully. He didn't suffer fools, and he certainly didn't coddle his students. And if he tried to teach you how to swim and you couldn't learn, you drowned.\nEmma: Drowned?\nRegina: That's it.\nEmma: That's what?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Regina used her powers to transport Emma and her on a bridge.)\nEmma: What the hell are you doing?!\nRegina: Teaching you to swim.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(At Granny's Diner.)\nDavid: Come on. Think hard, Hook. Are you sure you can't remember anything that can be useful?\nHook: My apologies, mate, but if I'd run across a prince during my adventure, I think I'd remember it.\nAriel: I just... I don't understand. How could he vanish without a trace?\nMary Margaret: That's it. Maybe he didn't.\nDavid: What do you mean?\nMary Margaret: When the curse brought us back here, it brought our things, too. Gold's shop is filled with them.\nDavid: And if we find something of Eric's, we can use a locator spell to track him.\nAriel: Let's go.\nHook: Sounds like a plan. Best of luck with that.\nMary Margaret: Oh, wait, no. You should come with us. You might remember something that we won't... Or can't. You'd be far more helpful than us.\nHook: Well, someone has to keep an eye on the boy.\nDavid: Well, Mary Margaret and I can take over. Could we... Have a talk for a moment?\n(Hook and David go apart.)\nDavid: What is it?\nHook: You sure this is such a good idea, mate? Let's be honest... There's only one obvious explanation why the little mermaid here can't find her prince. He's dead. There's no reason to ply her with false hope.\nDavid: In my experience, there's no such thing. You just have to believe. Now go. Good luck.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Enchanted Forest - Past Year ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Hook, Ariel and Mr Smee are walking into the woods.)\nAriel: Trudge, trudge, trudge. If you ask me, there's nothing more boring than land travel. I'll take my tail in the ocean any day.\nHook: That's one thing we can agree on... Minus the tail, of course. You won't be bored for much longer. Our destination is just past this rise.\nAriel: Then it won't be long until I'm reunited...\nHook: Here. Allow me.\nAriel: You've ripped it!\nHook: It's a cloak.\nAriel: It's Eric's cloak. And he's had it since before we met. He left it with me while he was away to keep him close, and now you have ruined it!\nHook: If mending a cloak is our biggest obstacle, we're in fine shape. You realize you might not find him... Or survive?\nAriel: I will.\nHook: Didn't you see the fear Black Beard's name struck into my crew? You don't become a pirate captain through mercy. If I were you, I would prepare myself for the worst.\nAriel: Why? What are you saying... That you would kill Eric if you had him?\nHook: You don't believe that?\nAriel: Well, honestly, I was a little surprised to hear that you might be responsible for Eric's kidnapping... After the stories that I've heard.\nHook: What stories?\nAriel: Well, the ones of you helping reunite Snow White and her family in Neverland. Some people say that you're a hero.\nHook: Don't believe every story you hear.\nAriel: Being good is nothing to be ashamed of. People change. Look at me. I have legs, and I fell in love with a human. I don't think anyone saw that coming.\nHook: You may have changed. I haven't. I'm a pirate, and I always will be.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Storybrooke ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(At Mr Gold's shop.)\nAriel: Belle?\nBelle: Ariel? Where... Where have you been? I... I was... I was worried I'd never see you again.\nAriel: I've been looking for Eric. He's been missing since we all returned.\nHook: We were hoping we could find something of his here.\nBelle: Oh, of course... To see if he's in Storybrooke.\nAriel: Have you seen anything of his?\nBelle: I, um, I only just started sorting through things, but, uh... Don't despair. Let's... Let's start looking.\n(They start to look.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Hook enters in the back room.)\nHook: I've been wondering where you went.\n(He uses his telescope and the button of Eric's cloak. Ariel and Belle enter.)\nAriel: That's Eric's. How did you know that was his?\nHook: I, uh... I wasn't sure. I saw the sea-creature clasp and remembered he was from a maritime kingdom.\nAriel: He is. He was. And now he's here.\n(Ariel hugs Hook.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(On the bridge.)\nEmma: Are you out of your mind?!\nRegina: Every time you've exhibited your power, it's been spurred by your instincts. So today, we're going to push those instincts until you master them.\nEmma: A little reading doesn't sound so bad now.\nRegina: You can stop me.\nEmma: Stop you from what?\nRegina: This.\n(Regina destroys the bridge.)\nEmma: What the hell are you doing?!\nRegina: Making the bridge collapse. You can either stop it... Or die.\nEmma: Aah! Regina! Enough! Stop this!\nRegina: No, you stop it. No more hand-holding. You have to do this. Reach into your gut. You know you can do this. It's inside you, Emma. Save the bridge. Save yourself.\nEmma: Aaaaah!\n(Emma falls but she uses her powers to build a bridge which brings her to Regina.)\nEmma: Did I... Did I just do that?\nRegina: Yes. When all I wanted was for you to retie the rope.\nEmma: It was like you said... Instinct. Why are you pissed? I did it. Why does it matter how?\nRegina: You think I'm mad because you didn't listen to me? I'm mad because... Look at all this potential inside of you, and you've been wasting it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(At Mr Gold's shop. Belle pours a potion on Eric's cloak.)\nBelle: This is a locator spell, so whatever object it's poured on becomes enchanted and returns itself to its rightful owner.\nAriel: Thank you, Belle. I know that you've been busy trying to find a way to break your Mr. Gold out of the Witch's control. You didn't have to do this.\nBelle: No, I... I did. You know. Perhaps a little good news around here will be contagious.\n(The cloak flies away.)\nAriel: Let's go!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Enchanted Forest - Past Year ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(On the docks, near the Jolly Roger.)\nHook: Up close, she's even more beautiful than I remember. Don't worry, my dear. You'll soon be back in my loving arms.\nAriel: You do realize you're talking to a boat?\nHook: You have your love. I have mine.\nSmee: So, how are we gonna get on board, Captain? Black Beard's crew outnumbers us.\nHook: I'll show you.\n(Hook stands up. He stuns a pirate and goes on board.)\nHook: Stand at attention, mates! Now boarding the ship... The rightful captain of the Jolly Roger. Now, if the coward who tried stealing her from me would kindly show his face, I'll give him the punishment he deserves.\nBlack Beard: Gladly. But it's not me who'll be punished. You want your ship back? Then take it.\nHook: With pleasure.\n(Hook and Black Beard fight.)\nBlack Beard: I was afraid you weren't gonna show up. Word on the waterways is Captain Hook had gone soft.\nHook: The only thing soft will be your guts spilling on this deck. I'd never give up the Jolly Roger without a fight.\n(Hook and Black Beard continue the fight.)\nHook: You think you know the ship?\nBlack Beard: Oh, every inch of it... I assure you.\nHook: If that was the case... You'd know not to step there!\nBlack Beard: Aah!\n(Black Beard is trapped.)\nHook: Oh, I've been meaning to fix that.\nBlack Beard: Finish it!\nHook: Fancy a shave, do we? Well, I'll be happy to oblige.\nAriel: Wait! Eric's not on board. You have to get him to tell you where he is.\nHook: You heard the lady. Where is he?\nBlack Beard: So, that's what this was... A rescue mission for some wench? Ha! They were right about you, Hook. You have gone soft.\nHook: I can either make this painful... Or quite painful. Now answer!\nBlack Beard: I have him stashed safe and sound on a deserted island. Only I know where. I was planning to ransom him when the time was right.\nAriel: Whatever it is, I'll pay it.\nBlack Beard: Money's not what I'm after anymore.\nAriel: Then what is it that you want?\nBlack Beard: The satisfaction of proving Captain Hook is no longer a pirate.\nHook: How are you gonna prove that?\nBlack Beard: By giving you a choice. Surrender the Jolly Roger to me, and I'll tell you where I'm holding her prince. Or refuse, and he dies along with me.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Storybrooke ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Hook and Ariel follow Eric's cloak across Storybrooke's street.)\nAriel: We must be getting close. Maybe he's on one of these boats.\n(The cloak dives into the see.)\nAriel: It must be searching. If the spell worked and... It's taken us to Eric, then... He's gone.\nHook: I'm sorry.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(In the street.)\nMary Margaret: Are you sure this is a good idea?\nDavid: You said you wanted to take action, so we're taking action.\nMary Margaret: Well...\nDavid: Mary Margaret... Our grandson would rather spend time with a pirate than us, but not after today.\nMary Margaret: It's dangerous... Not to mention illegal!\nDavid: It couldn't be safer. And as far as legality, I'm the sheriff.\n(David joins Henry in the car.)\nHenry: So, are you sure this is okay?\nDavid: Well, if Killian can teach you how to steal a boat, I can teach you how to drive.\nHenry: Technically, we borrowed it.\nDavid: Well, what do you say we see how you can handle a land vessel? Okay. Steady, steady. There you go. All right. Steady. Steady.\nHenry: I... I got it. I got it.\nDavid: Steady. Steady.\nHenry: Okay.\nDavid: Watch out!\n(Henry crashes into a mail box.)\nMary Margaret: Oh!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(On the docks.)\nAriel: I saved Eric from the sea once before. I just never thought that I would lose him to it in the end.\nHook: A sailor couldn't hope for a better resting place.\nAriel: Thank you.\nHook: I didn't do anything.\nAriel: You found Eric's cloak. I would have never stopped looking for him. At least now I know that our story's over. I just wish I knew how it ended. You're more than a pirate, Hook. You have a true heart. I'll always be grateful that you tried to help me.\n(Ariel leaves.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Enchanted Forest - Past Year ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Hook is about to push Black Beard under the sea but Ariel stops him.)\nAriel: You can't do this. We had an agreement. You promised me that you would help find Eric. Please. I know that you are a good man, and I know that man Is still in there somewhere. It's not too late to do the right thing. Isn't true love more important than a few planks of wood and a sail?\nHook: She might just be a few planks and a sail, but she's mine. She's all I need. Love brings nothing but wasted years and endless torment. I'm doing you a favour. A little something to whet the appetite of our razor-toothed friends below.\n(Hook pushes Black Beard.)\nAriel: No!!\nHook: Enjoy the feast, boys! The Jolly Roger is mine! Any man willing to swear an oath to me shall be given quarter. Those who don't, you're welcome to follow your former captain.\nThe crew: Captain Hook!\nHook: You may release her, Mr. Smee.\nAriel: I was wrong about you, Captain. You're selfish, and you're heartless. And that is what will bring you wasted years and endless torment. I feel sorry for you. You'll never be happy.\nHook: Where do you think you're going?\nAriel: Eric's still out there, and whatever it takes, I will find him.\n(Ariel dives into the ocean.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[ Storybrooke ]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(On the docks.)\nHook: Ariel! Wait!\nAriel: What is it?\nHook: I have a confession. I haven't been entirely truthful with you... With myself. You and I met before. Our paths crossed during the missing year.\nAriel: What?\nHook: Eric had been kidnapped by the pirate Black Beard. You asked me to find him.\nAriel: I... I don't understand. Why didn't you say anything?\nHook: Because I was too ashamed. I sacrificed saving your prince for my ship. I am so sorry, Ariel.\nAriel: You're a coward! And a monster! You let a man die for your ship?! What kind of person does that?\nHook: The kind who's empty, who believes that a ship can fill a void left by a broken heart.\nAriel: And that makes it okay?!\nHook: No, it doesn't. I would give anything to take it back, to make things right.\nAriel: Anything?\nHook: Yes... Anything.\nAriel: How am I supposed to trust a man who no longer believes in love?\nHook: I still do.\nAriel: Then swear to me on it. This woman that broke your heart... Do you still love her?\nHook: Yes.\nAriel: Then swear to me on her name.\nHook: I swear on Emma Swan.\nAriel: Thank you, Captain. That's exactly what I needed to hear.\n(Ariel uses magic to curse Hook's lips.)\nHook: What the hell?\n(Then she turns into Zelena.)\nHook: Zelena? It was you. Where's Ariel?\nZelena: Relax. She was never really here. After she left you on your beloved ship, she actually found where Black Beard had been keeping her prince.\nHook: She found him? How do you know that?\nZelena: My spies are always circling, Captain, through every realm... Always circling. She found him on Hangman's Island, which was outside the force of the curse. They've been living happily ever after ever since. Don't you just love a good twist?\nHook: I don't understand. Why would you pretend to be her?\nZelena: To corrupt your love. As I said earlier, I've known about your dirty little secret for quite some time... Seen the guilt on your face over the decision you made that day. I knew it haunted you. And I knew I could use it.\nHook: Use it for what?\nZelena: When you invoked the name of your love in a selfish plea for redemption, I was able to curse you... More specifically, your kiss. See, the next time your lips touch Emma Swan's, all of her magic will be taken. Everything that makes her special, that makes her powerful, that makes her a threat will be gone.\nHook: I won't do it. I'll tell her. And she'll defeat you.\nZelena: Then I'll send The Dark One to kill her before you can.\nHook: No... You won't... If you could have killed her, you would have. You need her power removed. It's why you didn't kill her when she came to the town. It's why you had a monkey look after her in New York instead of killing her. For some reason... You can't.\nZelena: It no longer matters, because you're going to remove her powers. I may not be able to hurt Emma, but I can hurt those around her... Her parents, her friends... Her child.\nHook: Do not go near them.\nZelena: Oh, yes. You've become quite fond of the boy, haven't you? I will enjoy turning him into a monkey's breakfast.\nHook: I'll stop you.\nZelena: No, you won't. That pointy, little hook of yours can scratch a mere mortal, but me? You're out of your depth, pirate. The choice is yours. Kiss Emma and remove her powers or everyone she loves dies.\n(Zelena disappears.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Hook knocks on the Charming Family's door. Emma opens.)\nHook: Swan? I didn't expect to see you here.\nEmma: What do you mean? Where's Henry? Is everything all right?\nHook: He's fine. He's with his grandparents. I thought they might be back here.\nEmma: We haven't seen them. If you're not with Henry, what have you been doing all day?\nHook: I was enlisted to help Ariel find her lost prince.\nRegina: Really? That fish is in Storybrooke?\nHook: She was, yes. And we found a clue in Gold's shop which led us to discover that Eric had been shipwrecked on Hangman's Island, just off the coast of the Enchanted Forest.\nEmma: Zelena's curse must not have reached that far.\nHook: Ariel's on her way there now. She wanted me to say goodbye to Mary Margaret for her.\nRegina: Oh. At the rate mermaids swim, she's probably already there. In fact, let's find out.\nEmma: I thought you couldn't use mirror magic to look between worlds.\nRegina: I can't. But after seeing the raw power you possess, I think maybe you can.\nHook: There's no need. I'm sure she's fine. Anyway, it's bad form to spy on such a private affair.\nEmma: How do I do it?\nRegina: Well, you've focused. You've let emotions awaken your power. Now you have to look inward.\n(The see Ariel and Eric, happy, on the mirror.)\nEmma: You did this? You brought them together?\nHook: No. It was Ariel. She never stopped believing.\nEmma: Modesty? You're just full of surprises today.\n(Henry, David and Mary Margaret enter.)\nEmma: Where have you guys been?\nHenry: Only having the best day ever. David let me drive his truck.\nRegina: You let him what?! Oh. A... As mayor, I can't let an unlicensed, underage driver on the streets of Storybrooke.\nDavid: As mayor, you might want to throw a little money at road repair.\nRegina: Excuse me?\nDavid: Nothing.\nRegina: This is a terrible mistake.\nEmma: She's right. Someone could have been seriously hurt.\nMary Margaret: Only if you're a mailbox.\nHenry: It was so much fun.\nDavid: What can I say? I've got a reckless, carefree... Fun side.\nMary Margaret: Killian? Where's our friend?\nHook: It turns out her missing... Husband was back home after all.\nEmma: It's true. We just checked in on them on... Skype.\nHook: She sends her regards, but she was too excited to wait.\nMary Margaret: A happy ending. Well, maybe our luck's about to change. Dinner at Granny's?\nHenry: Can I drive?\nEmma & Regina: No!\nHook: Well, I guess I'll leave you guys to it.\nEmma: You're not coming?\nHook: Another time, perhaps.\nEmma: Well, if you change your mind, you know where we'll be. And, Killian... Whatever happened this past year, whatever you're not telling me... I don't care. I'm tired of living in the past.\nHook: I know how you feel.\n(Hook leaves.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The Charming Family and Regina have diner at Granny's.

Floodlights come on and a body can clearly be seen lying in the street, SOCO (Scene of crime officer) and police officers are milling around the scene.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTwo police officer's standing in the rain, a male and a woman. The male is holding a cup of coffee.\nGWEN : Oh, hot. Gwen takes the coffee.\nPC : Gwen, there's not enough. You didn't order. Gwen walks away towards another police officer.\nPC (off camera) : What do I do now ?\nGWEN (calls back) : Well I've only just arrived so tough. Who is it ?\nPC ANDY : I dunno, some bloke. You going to stop over on Friday ?\nGWEN : I dunno, what is it ? Drinks ?\nPC ANDY : A bit of pizza I think.\nGWEN : Might do, yeah. Police Officers move SOCO, \"SOCO leaving scene\" can be heard from the police radio.\nPC ANDY : Ay ay, what's happening here then.\nPOLICE OFFICERS : On you go. Come on now.\nPC ANDY : Move back if you could, thank you. He starts moving people back, moves away from Gwen who is left to watch on her own.\nGWEN : Hey what's going on ? Gwen speaks in general to anyone then walks up to SOCO.\nGWEN : Excuse me sir, what is it, what's happening ?\nSOCO : Buggered if I'd know, it's orders from above.\nGWEN : But the body is still there though, isn't it though. You can't just leave it.\nSOCO : Move back they said. Clear the site. Special access they said.\nGWEN : For who ?\nSOCO : Torchwood. A black SUV pulls into the site. Four people get out, Jack, Suzie, Owen and Toshiko. They walk past the police and stand by the body, rain still pounding down.\nGWEN : Who's Torchwood ?\nSOCO : Special op's or something. He glances at Gwen's coffee.\nSOCO : That hot ?\nGWEN : Huh ? Oh yeah, have it. But they're not allowed in there, they could contaminate the evidence and all sorts. I mean how can they...\nSOCO : Don't ask me. There's no procedure anymore. It's a f*cking disgrace. The SOCO walks away with Gwen's coffee. Gwen stares after him and then looks at the Torchwood team. Jack turns in her direction but does not appear to be looking at her. Gwen tries to see what they are doing. She looks up and sees a multi story car park.\nINT. FLIGHTS OF CONCRETE STAIRS\nGwen runs up the stairs and into the car park a few floors up. She goes to the edge of the car park floor and leans over the balcony, and starts to watch and listen to them. Gwen overlooking body and Torchwood team.\nEXT. ALLEY NEXT TO THE BODY\nTorchwood around the murder victim.\nJACK : There you go, I can taste it, oestrogen. Definitely oestrogen. (He looks up slightly, dripping with rain). You take the pill flush it away, it enters the water cycle. Feminises the fish. Suzie pulls a gauntlet from a crate and puts it on.\nJACK : Goes all the way up into the sky and then falls all the way back down onto me. Contraceptives in the rain. Love this planet. Still least I won't get pregnant. Never doing that again. Jack looks at Suzie.\nJACK : How's it going ?\nSUZIE : Nothing yet, its got to connect. I just gotta feel it.\nOWEN : Then hurry up and feel it. Freezing my arse off here.\nSUZIE : I can't just flip a switch ! It's more like access, it, it grants me access.\nOWEN : Whatever that means.\nSUZIE : It's like, oh, oh, oh, oh. The glove starts to glow, working.\nJACK : Positions...\nOWEN : If I get punched again, I'm punching him right back.\nJACK : Just concentrate. Suzie... Jack nods at her and then Suzie places her hand under the corpse's head. The rain stops around them and the lights get brighter. The corpse breathes out. Gwen looks down, she is shocked.\nBODY : There was, I was, I was, I was... oh my god what's goin' on ?\nTOSHIKO : Listen to me, we've only got 2 minutes so it's important that you listen, ok...\nBODY : Who are you ?\nTOSHIKO : Trust me. You're dead.\nBODY : How am I dead ?\nOWEN : You were stabbed.\nBODY : I'm not dead, I can see you.\nTOSHIKO : We've brought you back, but we haven't got long. I'm sorry but you've got to concentrate. Who did this to you ? What did you see ?\nBODY : But why am I dead ?\nTOSHIKO : Who attacked you ?\nBODY : I don't want to be dead !\nSUZIE : 60 seconds.\nTOSHIKO : You've got to think, just focus on me. What was the last thing you saw ? Jack sighs, clearly frustrated.\nBODY : I didn't see anything. I dunno.\nTOSHIKO : Who killed you ? Did you see them ?\nBODY : I dunno. There was something behind me.\nOWEN : Police said one stab wound in the back.\nTOSHIKO : So you didn't see anything.\nBODY : No. There is a long pause, each Torchwood member looks at the body.\nBODY : What happens now ?\nSUZIE : 30 seconds.\nTOSHIKO : But he didn't see anything.\nSUZIE : Don't waste it.\nTOSHIKO : What else do I say ?\nJACK (crouching down) : What's your name ?\nBODY : John. John Tucker.\nJACK : Ok John. Not long now.\nBODY : Who are you ?\nJACK : Captain Jack Harkness. Tell me what was it like when ya died ? What did ya see ? (Pause) John, tell me what you saw.\nSUZIE : 10 seconds.\nBODY : Nothing... I saw nothing... Oh my god there's nothing. John stops breathing, his head falls back into Suzie's hands, dead once more and the rain resumes falling heavily. Gwen stares at them from above.\nSUZIE : sh1t !\nOWEN : I said it was stupid telling him he was dead.\nTOSHIKO : Well you try it.\nOWEN : Trust me. Like that's gonna work.\nJACK : Told the last corpse he was injured and he wasted the whole two minutes screaming for an ambulance. Maybe there's no right way of doing it. Jack looks up, straight at Gwen and calls out.\nJACK : What do you think ?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGwen standing at the car park wall looking over. Gwen leans back shocked when Jack sees her. She runs across the car back and back onto the street. She bends down breathing shallow, shocked and confused.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nARIEL VIEW OF CARDIFF\nINT. GWEN'S FLAT - LATER THAT NIGHT\nGwen enters pauses in the entrance and then goes upstairs and walks towards the sofa. Rhys, her boyfriend, is sitting watching TV.\nGWEN : Still up ?\nRHYS : In 'ere. They said on the news murder in the city centre. Were you there ?\nGWEN : No. I dunno, nothing to do with me... How come you're still up though ? Gwen sits next to Rhys and kisses him on the forehead. Clearly they are an established couple.\nRHYS : Oh, Banana Boat came round. He was saying he's got plans. He's off again next summer.\nGWEN : How come you're not pissed then ?\nRHYS : Ooo, well we 'ad a cup o' tea. He's read this thing about diabetes. Me and him 'avin tea, that's middle age that is. There's some Chinese in the fridge.\nGWEN : No I'm not hungry. You coming to bed ?\nRHYS : Just finish here. This man's found his sister.\nGWEN : I'll see you in a minute. Gwen walks away.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGWEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\nGwen lying awake in bed unable to sleep.\nARIEL CARDIFF - DAY\nINT. POLICE OFFICE - CARDIFF - DAY\nGwen enters and sees a colleague walking down the stairs carrying files.\nGWEN : Yvonne, can you do me a favour ? Can you a search for me ?\nYVONNE : Join the queue.\nGWEN : It's a Captain Jack Harkness, can you check him out ? Gwen passes Yvonne and starts to walk up the stairs.\nYVONNE : I'm busy. See's there's proper channels, Gwen. What sort of Captain ?\nGWEN : Dunno, just a Captain.\nYVONNE : If I get time.\nGWEN (calls down stairs) : Thanks.\nINT. POLICE MURDER INVESTIGATION ROOM - CARDIFF\nPolice officers are looking at crime scene photos pined to a wall and discussing the facts of the case. Gwen enters carrying a tray of tea and coffee.\nOFFICER : Sarah Palaster, 72. Murdered in her front room. Rani Ghosh, 45. Murdered in Robin Tree Alley and now John Tucker, 19, murdered in Sangavalith Lane. There's absolutely nothing linking these three victims. Apart from the way they died. As far as we can tell, all with the same weapon. A blade, approximately 8 inches long, 3 inches deep.\nYOUNG COP : The two women were stabbed from the front but John Tucker was stabbed from behind. What does that tell us about the killer ?\nOFFICER : That he's a coward.\nEXT. A STREET - DAY\nGwen and Andy exit police car and walk towards a pub.\nGWEN : But those people last night. The people in the car. Who were they ? What's Torchwood ?\nPC ANDY : I dunno, special ops.\nGWEN : Yeah but what does that mean ?\nPC ANDY : Bet you ten quid they're DNA specialists. It's all DNA these days. Like that CSI bollocks. CSI Cardiff, I'd like to see that. They'd be measuring the velocity of a kebab. Gwen and Andy enter the pub. A bar brawl is in progress. Gwen and Andy enter and try to separate the combatants.\nANDY : Thank you very much. Thank you... Gwen is pushed aside and knocked over, she bangs her head on a pillar and appears to be in pain.\nINT. HOSPITAL - CARDIFF - DOCTORS ROOM - LATER THAT DAY\nA doctor is treating Gwen's head injury. Gwen walks out of the doctors room holding her head, she sees a man running up the stairs, she believes him to be Jack. She follows him up the stairs, running. Upon reaching the top of the stairs Gwen finds a plastic-sealed doorway and Jack has disappeared. She hears a door bang open below her and looks over the stairs to see a porter.\nGWEN : 'Scuse me. Sorry. It's all sealed off up there. Who did that ? Gwen indicates the sealed door.\nPORTER : I thought it was you lot.\nGWEN : But what's it for ? What's happened.\nPORTER : I dunno. 9 o'clock this morning it was all sealed off, they never said. Chemicals or something. The porter walks off, Gwen enters through a gap in the plastic of the sealed off door.\nGWEN : Hello ! Gwen walks forward and sees a figure at the end of the corridor.\nGWEN : Sorry I'm just looking for someone... Gwen cautiously approaches, talking to the figure.\nGWEN (to self) : Yeah, right, clever... A weevil remains motionless except to tilt it's head at her.\nGWEN : Anyway I dunno if you saw a man come through here. A tall man, in one of those big sort of military coats. Ok. If you could answer, this is official business. Gwen notices the man appears to be wearing a mask.\nGWEN : You alright ? That's good. That's a good mask sort of thing... Look I'm sorry if I'm interrupting something, but we can stop this now, ok ? It's all very well playing silly buggers but I'm busy, alright. Now I'm looking for a man in a big grey coat. I said we can stop being silly. The weevil opens its mouth and hisses. The porter enters the corridor and walks towards Gwen.\nPORTER : Ah, there you are. I did ask but I saw Doctor Mahieb cos I thought it was him said about the police, but he said no and then I said about the chemicals and he said don't be so stupid, \"what chemicals ?\" So I dunno, could be anything. The porter walks towards Gwen and notices the Weevil.\nPORTER : Who've you got with you there then ? So much for sealing it off. Oh, ha, there's a face, nice one, oh tell ya mate you should try plastic surgery. Not on the NHS mind. The Porter glances from the weevil to Gwen.\nPORTER : You alright ?\nGWEN : Yeah.\nPORTER : Bloody hell that is brilliant. That's like, erm, Hellraiser ! That's first class that is ! The porter stands close to the weevil and indicates the teeth.\nPORTER : Look at that ! It's just like real teeth. The weevil grabs the caretaker's head and bites into his neck, blood spurts from his pierced jugular. Enter Jack, Owen and Suzie. Jack grabs Gwen and runs down the corridor with her.\nJACK : Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go ! INTERCUT WITH : Shots of Owen and Suzie subduing the weevil and putting a black plastic bag over it's head. Jack stops at the end of the corridor. Gwen continues running out of the corridor and down the stairs. She stops running in the hospital entrance hall. Gwen goes into the hospital car park sees the Torchwood SUV. The SUV leaves the car park at speed, honking the horn to move her from their path. Gwen begins to run after it and then gets into a police car and pursues. PC Andy, eating, sees her drives past.\nANDY : Oi !\nEXT. OVERVIEW - CONTINUOUS\nThe police car follows the Torchwood SUV along the motorway.\nGWEN (VO) : Registration, Charlie Foxtrot 06.\nINT.

'Cept he disappeared. Vanished off the records, presumed dead.\nGWEN : When was that ?\nYVONNE : 1941 at the height of blitz. The morning of January the 21st 1941, Captain Jack Harkness failed to report for duty. Never seen again until now. What's going on Gwen, you seeing ghosts ?\nEXT. IN FRONT OF MILLENNIUM CENTRE - DAY\nGwen following the SUV in police car. The SUV pauses, Jack, Suzie, Owen and Tosh exit the vehicle and the SUV departs. Gwen parks in the middle of the square and exits the vehicle and shouts after Torchwood.\nGWEN : You lot. Oi Torchwood ! The Torchwood team ignores her and continues walking. Gwen starts to follow and is approached by a security guard.\nSECURITY : Oi ! You can't leave that there !\nGWEN : Police !\nSECURITY : I can see that love and you're still not leaving it there. Gwen looks over at the Millennium Fountain and notices the Torchwood team have vanished. Gwen walks towards the fountain.\nSECURITY : I'm talking to you ! Excuse me ! Move your bloody car ! Gwen wanders around the fountain trying to see how they could have disappeared.\nINT. POLICE CAR - A SHORT TIME LATER\nGwen is speaking into her radio.\nGWEN : Did you get anything on that registration ?\nOFFICER (over radio) : No such number.\nGWEN : What does that mean ?\nOFFICER (over radio) : It doesn't exist, double checked for Swansea, triple checked. There's nothing, no such vehicle. But Temple's been asking 'bout you Gwen. You in trouble ? PC Andy enters Gwen's vehicle.\nPC ANDY : I have walked ! I have bloody walked ! They share a glance, Gwen appearing apologetic.\nEXT. MILLENNIUM FOUNTAIN - SHORT TIME LATER\nGwen stands next to the Millennium Fountain.\nGWEN : They were here and then they were gone, and look there's nowhere to hide, they just disappeared ! Andy stands near, arms folded.\nPC ANDY : Temple's not just livid he's doing his nut.\nGWEN : There was a man I'm telling you. There was this porter, he was in a porter's uniform and he was killed,or at least he was injured, he must have been injured ! Right in front of me ! This man in a mask sort of lashed out and...\nANDY : I've told you, all hospital staff present and correct.\nGWEN : I saw it.\nPC ANDY : That's sick. Gwen, sweetheart think about it, what sort of story is that ? You're not well, come with me I'll take you home.\nGWEN : They were here...\nPC ANDY : Come on.

GWEN'S FLAT - LATER SAME DAY\nGwen enters the living room / kitchen and sees Rhys cooking.\nRHYS : Look at me, cooking. Hot pot ! Or as ze French call it, 'ot pot. Gwen smiles fondly and kisses Rhys.\nGWEN : I should've phoned. I've gotta work.\nRHYS : You should be off sick.\nGWEN : I know. But they were short and there's a match on tonight. I said I'd take another shift, I'm sorry. Forgive me, go on, forgive me, say you forgive me.\nRHYS (smiles) : Yeah... Gwen kisses Rhys.\nGWEN : I gotta go.\nARIEL CARDIFF\nEXT. MILLENNIUM FOUNTAIN - NIGHT\nGwen is walking round the millennium square fountain, trying to see how Torchwood could have got away earlier. She notices a pizza delivery bike drive past.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCCTV footage of Gwen, on hub computer screen.\nINT. JUBILEE PIZZA - SAME NIGHT\nGwen enters the pizza shop. A young lad works behind the counter.\nGWEN : Scuse me, Gwen Copper, CID. I'm making some enquiries 'round the bay. I need to check some people out on your list if that's ok. I don't supposed you deliver to a Captain Jack Harkness.\nPIZZA LAD : Ah, I dunno.\nGWEN : Well could you 'av a look ? The man behind the counter checks the computer.\nPIZZA LAD : No. He's not a regular anyway.\nGWEN : J. Harkness or just Harkness. The pizza boy checks the computer again.\nPIZZA LAD : No.\nGWEN : Ok, never mind. Thanks anyway. Gwen starts to leave Jubilee Pizza then turns back to the counter\nGWEN : I don't suppose you've got a Torchwood ?\nPIZZA LAD : Oh aye ! We do them all the time. They're good customers.\nEXT. CARDIFF BAY - NIGHT\nGwen walks along the bay carrying pizza boxes.\nINT. TOURIST INFORMATION OFFICE - LATER THE SAME NIGHT\nGwen enters the reception area and looks around. A man enters through a beaded curtain behind the desk and smiles at Gwen.\nGWEN : Oh hiya. Sorry I'm late. Someone ordered pizza.\nIANTO : Who's it for ?\nGWEN : I think it's a Mr Harkness. Gwen flinches as the door she entered through closes behind her. Ianto presses a button behind the desk and a part of the wall opens to reveal a passageway. Gwen looks surprised.\nIANTO : Don't keep 'em waitin'. Gwen goes to the doorway and glances back at Ianto. He inclines his head in encouragement. Gwen walks cautiously down an ill lit brick passageway. A door opens at one end of the corridor, Gwen walks towards it and enters a lift. She goes down several storeys. She exit's the lift and goes through a large cog shaped door ahead of her. Camera pans right, around the Hub. The cog door and some bars slide shut behind Gwen. She glances at them and then notices a cylindrical container in which a hand is held in pale blue bubbling liquid. The Torchwood members working at their stations.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSomeone welding, the mask is removed to reveal Suzie.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nJack on the balcony walk down the stairs and into his office. Gwen walks towards Jack's office door past Toshiko and Owen who are on the computers. Gwen approaches slowly and they start laughing, Owen turns round on his chair to face Gwen.\nOWEN : I can't do this, I'm sorry. I'm rubbish. I give up.\nTOSHIKO (pointing) : He set me off.\nSUZIE : Well that lasted nought point two seconds.\nOWEN : Mmm, she's actually carrying pizza.\nJACK : Come on ! She was gonna say here's your pizza and I was gonna say how much ? And she says oh, whatever, 20 quid and I say ooo... I don't have any money. I was working on a punch line, I'd have got there, but it would have been good.\nGWEN : There's your pizza, I think I better go.\nJACK : I think we've gone past that stage.\nSUZIE : You must have been freezing out there, how long you walking round ? Three hours ?\nGWEN : You could see me ?\nSUZIE : Mhmm.\nJACK : And before we go any further. Who the hell orders pizza under the name of Torchwood ?\nOWEN : Err, yeah, that would be me. Sorry I'm a twat.\nGWEN : That man at the hospital ? That porter ? What happened to him ? That was real wasn't it, he was attacked ?\nJACK : He's dead.\nGWEN : But there's no one gone missing.\nTOSHIKO : I took the body, retrospectively changed the work rota. Planted a false witness who saw him leaving the hospital, giving him an alibi for the next 48 hours so that when his body is pulled out of the docks next Tuesday night, he's only been missing for three days.\nGWEN : He was murdered.\nTOSHIKO : Yeah.\nGWEN : And you covered it up.\nTOSHIKO (shrugs) : It's my job.\nGWEN : And that other man, John Tucker. Last night in the alleyway, I saw you...\nJACK : And what did you see ?\nGWEN : You revived him.\nJACK : No. What did you see ?\nGWEN : You resuscitated him.\nJACK : No. What did you see ?\nGWEN : You brought him back to life.\nJACK : Yeah.\nGWEN : Who are you ?\nJACK : Torchwood.\nGWEN : What's Torchwood ?\nJACK : This is Torchwood, all around you. Jack indicates the Hub.\nGWEN : And what happens to me ?\nJACK : Ohh...\nGWEN : I'm police. Constable Gwen Cooper. You can't do anything.\nJACK : Alright PC Cooper. Do you want to come see ?\nGWEN : See what ?\nJACK : You saw the murder. Come and see the murderer. Jack walks away, expecting Gwen to follow. Gwen pauses and Suzie notices her expression.\nSUZIE : Go with him. Gwen puts the pizza down on a sofa and follows Jack.\nGWEN : What is Torchwood ? Who are you ? What is this place ? Something screeches above Gwen and she ducks.\nGWEN : What was that ?\nTOSHIKO (bored) : Pterodactyl.\nJACK (off screen) : Are you coming ?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. TORCHWOOD CELLS\nJack opens the cell block door and enters followed by Gwen. The line of cells are dark, the paint on the wall flaking off. The cells have one clear wall, facing the corridor, with air holes. They walk to the end of a line of cells and Jack switches on the light to the end cell. Gwen looks in and jumps when she sees the Weevil inside.\nJACK : It's alright. It's safe. It's sedated. It's called a weevil, or at least we call them weevils. We don't know their real name because they're not too good at communicating. But we got a couple of hundred of them in city. Living in the sewers, feeding off the... well it's the sewers you can guess. But every once in a while one of them goes rogue, comes to the surface, attacks. Actually it's been happening more and more and we have no idea why. But it's alien. Look into its eyes. Jack gets a stool for Gwen and helps her sit. He remains standing behind her.\nJACK : There you go. Take your time. It was born on a different world and it's real. Gwen stares into the weevil's eyes.\nINT. TORCHWOOD HUB CENTRAL - SOMETIME LATER\nJack and Gwen stand in the centre surrounded by the rest of the team at their stations. Jack makes introductions.\nJACK : Owen Harper, Gwen Cooper.\nOWEN : Dr. Owen Harper, thank you.\nJACK : Toshiko Sato, computer genius. Suzie Costello she's second in command, and this is Ianto Jones. He cleans up after us and gets us everywhere on time.\nIANTO : I try my best...\nJACK : And he looks good in a suit.\nIANTO : Careful. That's harassment sir.\nGWEN : But why are you telling me their names, I'm not supposed to know am I ? This is classified isn't it ?\nJACK : Way beyond classified...\nGWEN : Then you shouldn't be telling me. What're you going to do to me ?\nJACK : What do you imagine ?\nGWEN : Well I've seen too much. Your names and everything and the weevil... you can dump a man in the water a lie about his death...\nJACK : Ok, Tosh finish that calibration tomorrow morning. Owen first thing get hold of Chandler and Belle because I think they're lying. Ianto, if he needs back up then you better be on stand by. Suzie, I know it's a pain in the ass but I need the costing on the glove research... And as for you, you're coming with me. This way. Jack looks at Gwen and then walks way, again expecting Gwen to follow.\nGWEN : I'm getting tired of following you.\nJACK : No you're not and you never will... He turns to look at her then steps onto a stone platform.\nJACK : Stand on here, come on, with me. Jack holds out his hand to Gwen, helps her step onto the platform and then puts his arm around her.\nTOSHIKO (off screen) : Goodnight !\nOWEN (off screen) : Later !\nJACK : Now, you came in through the front door, lets take the scenic route. Jack presses a button on his wrist cuff and the ceiling 4 stories up opens. The platform starts to move upwards. Gwen grabs Jack's arm to steady herself. Suzie looks up at them as the platform rises.\nEXT. IN FRONT OF MILLENNIUM FOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS\nJack and Gwen stand on the platform, which now appears to be a normal paving slab. They are apparently in clear view of the passing pedestrians.\nGWEN : But... but they can see the lift. Why aren't they, I mean, we are right out in the open they can see everything.\nJACK : Do they look like they can see us ?\nGWEN : No but look at us, we couldn't be anymore public. Jack shouts at a passer by. The man does not notice them.\nJACK : Hello ! Hey you there ! Hello ! It's called a perception filter, he can sort of see us but we don't quite register. Just like something in the corner of your eye. It only works on this exact spot. Step off... Jack moves from the platform and waves at a passing lady who stares at him.\nJACK : Hi ! Nice night. Ooh, and low we are perceived.\nGWEN : How does it work ?\nJACK : No idea. We know how to use it, not how it happens. But if I were to guess I would say it was once a dimensionally transcendental chameleon circuit placed right on this spot which welded it's perception properties to a spacio-temporal rift. Now that sounds kinda ridiculous. Invisible lift has got more of a ring to it don't you think ?\nGWEN : But hold on, if no one can see it when the lifts coming up, there's a bloody big hole in the floor, don't people fall in ?\nJACK : That is so Welsh.\nGWEN : What is ?\nJACK : I show you something fantastic, you find fault. Jack walks away followed by Gwen.\nARIEL VIEW CARDIFF\nINT. A BAR\nGwen and Jack are sitting at the bar. Gwen drinks deeply from her pint glass.\nGWEN : The thing is I just don't understand.\nJACK : No I'll tell you what I don't understand. You're going to rattle on with this \"how can this be true ?\" kinda shtick. What's it going to take for you people. If you want evidence of aliens, how about that great big space ship hovering over London on Christmas day ? What about the battle of Canary Wharf, a Cyberman in every home ?\nGWEN : My boyfriend says it's like some kind of terrorism. Like they put in drugs in the water supply, psychotropic drugs causing mass hallucinations and stuff.\nJACK : Yeah, well your boyfriend's stupid.\nGWEN : Oh you've met him ? Jack laughs and sips his water.\nGWEN : So you catch aliens ?\nJACK : Yep.\nGWEN : You catch aliens for a living.\nJACK : Yes we do.\nGWEN : You're an alien catcher.\nJACK : Yes I am.\nGWEN : Caught any good aliens ?\nJACK : Tones of them.\nGWEN : That's a hell of a job.\nJACK (laughs) : Sure is.\nGWEN : This is so weird. And who are you then ?\nJACK : Captain Jack Harkness.\nGWEN : I did some research and there's only one Captain Jack Harkness on record and he disappeared in 1941.\nJACK : Well that couldn't be me... could it ? We don't just catch aliens; we scavenge the stuff they leave behind, find ways of using it, arming the human race for the future. The 21st century is when it all changes and you gotta be ready.\nGWEN : But who's in charge of you, is it the government or what ?\nJACK : We're separate from the government, outside the police, beyond the United Nations cuz if one power got hold of this stuff, they could use it for their own purposes.\nGWEN : But so could you.\nJACK : All alien technology stays on the base no one's allowed to take anything outside.\nINT. TOSH'S KITCHEN - CONCURRENT\nToshiko enters and takes an alien device from her handbag.\nINT. OWEN'S BATHROOM - CONCURRENT\nOwen getting ready to go out, he removes a bottle from his bathroom cabinet.\nINT. SUZIE'S HOME - CONCURRENT\nSuzie removes the metal glove from her bag.\nINT. BAR - CONSECUTIVE\nGwen and Jack sitting in the bar drinking.\nGWEN : So go on then, how the hell did you end up in Cardiff ?\nJACK : This is Torchwood 3. Torchwood 1 was London, destroyed in the battle. Torchwood 2 is an office in Glasgow, very strange man. Torchwood 3, Cardiff, Torchwood 4 has kinda gone missing but we'll find it one day.\nGWEN : So you just fancied Cardiff ?\nJACK : There's a rift in space and time running right through the city. The weevils didn't come on a spaceship, they kinda just, slipped through. All sorts of things get washed up here, creatures, time shifts, space junk, debris. Flotsam and jetsam.\nGWEN : Sounds like Cardiff...\nJACK : Hey, hey, hey, don't knock it I'm a citizen.\nGWEN : But where are you from ?\nJACK (shrugs) : All sorts of places.\nGWEN : The thing is we could liaise on this, this serial killer. I could be like your liaison with the police.\nJACK : Right I can see the mistake : you think that because we turned up at the scene of crime we're out to catch the killer.\nGWEN : Uhhuh...\nJACK : Sorry, nothing to do with us.\nGWEN : Then what were you doing there ?\nJACK : Testing the glove, we need murder victims, simple as that. The glove only works on the recently deceased. The more violent the trauma the stronger the resurrection. All we needed was fresh meat.\nGWEN : No you were asking that man John Tucker, I saw you. You were asking him about his killer...\nJACK : He'd just been murdered. What else are you gonna ask ?\nGWEN : You could get an ID, you could help.\nJACK (shrugs) : We're busy.\nGWEN : And your work is more important ?\nJACK : Now you got it.\nGWEN : Well that's tough sh1t cos if you let me go then I have a duty, I can tell them what you've got because that glove could help us.\nJACK : If you remember.\nGWEN : What do you mean ?\nJACK : How's your drink ?\nGWEN : Have you poisoned me ?\nJACK : Don't be so dramatic. It's an amnesia pill, my own recipe, with a touch of denial and a dash of Retcon. Wake up tomorrow morning and you'll have forgotten everything about Torchwood, worst still you'll have forgotten me. Which is kinda tragic. Gwen appears shaken. She gets up leaves the bar. Jack follows her onto the street and calls after her.\nJACK : Don't think you can fight it by staying awake, I mixed in a little sedative to.\nGWEN : Then I'll tell someone...\nJACK : Do you really wanna do that ? Do you really want us to come and find them too ?\nGWEN : You b*st*rd !\nJACK : Language ! Nice knowing you Gwen Cooper. Jack winks at her and walks away. Gwen watches his go then runs away.\nEXT. A CAR PARK ENTRANCE / EXIT RAMP\nGwen runs up the ramp away from the car park.\nEXT. A STREET\nJack walks slowly up the street, hands in his pockets.\nINT.

Owen sprays his face with liquid from the bottle he took earlier.\nOWEN : So do you want a drink or what ? The girl's attitude markedly changes. suddenly finding Owen irresistible she kisses him passionately.\nLINDA : Bloody hellfire ! You're coming home with me you are. Right now. The girl pulls Owen's lapels and drags him from the bar.\nINT. GWEN'S STUDY - LATER THE SAME NIGHT\nGwen continues typing details about Torchwood onto her computer.\nINT.

Her boyfriend sees them and jogs over.\nCOLIN : Oi you b*st*rd, come 'ere. Linda what do you think you are doing with him ? What the f*ck do you think you're doing with him ?\nLINDA : I'm taking him home and I'm having him, now piss off.\nCOLIN : What the f*ck do you think you're doing with my girlfriend you b*st*rd.\nOWEN : Hey, I didn't know. She was on her own, she never said.\nCOLIN : You tosser, you f*cking tosser.\nLINDA : Colin, button it. He's mine.\nCOLIN : Do you wanna have a go do you ? Wanna have a go ? Well come on then mate.\nOWEN : Well if it makes it easier... Owen sprays his face with the alien liquid again. The boyfriend's expression changes and he kisses Owen.\nCOLIN : I'm so having you.\nLINDA : I'm having him first.\nOWEN : Taxi !\nINT. GWEN'S STUDY\nGwen begins to fall asleep, her typing flawed and her vision blurring.\nINT.

Rhys kisses Gwen's hair and she wakes, still groggy.\nRHYS : Did you get pissed ?\nGWEN : No. What time is it ?\nRHYS : 7:30. You said you were working last night.\nGWEN : I was.\nRHYS : Then how come you fell asleep in here ?\nGWEN : I haven't... I was, typing. That is work...\nRHYS : Not having a go, just saying. It's not exactly clever going out on a lash when you've just had a bang on the head. Hope you didn't drive in that state... who were you with ? Diane ?\nGWEN : Must have been yeah.\nINT. POLICE STATION ENTRANCE - LATER THAT MORNING\nGwen enters, followed by Yvonne.\nYVONNE : Had any luck ?\nGWEN : With what ?\nYVONNE : Captain Jack Harkness.\nGWEN : How'd ya mean ?

She walks upstairs and down a corridor, she walks past another police man.\nOFFICER : Hi\nGWEN : Hi. Gwen enters an office where plain clothes police are working at desks.\nDI JACOBS : Aye aye, come to see where the real work's done.\nGWEN : Yes sir. That's right sir, how's it going ?\nDI JACOBS : Sod all. Gwen sees a diagram of a knife.\nGWEN : Is that the murder weapon ? The officer nods and stands to join her looking at the picture.\nDI JACOBS : Clever mind. They worked it all out on the computer. Took measurements from the stab wounds; calculated the shape of the blade and stuff, even those prongs. I dunno how they do it. Nasty lookin'beast though. Do you recognise it ?\nGWEN (shakes her head) : No.\nDI JACOBS : We're trying to trace it. Can't be that many of them. Sort of, ornamental. We're checking the CV logs with customs in case it's been imported. Find the knife we might find the killer, well if it rings any bells give us a shout.\nGWEN : Yeah, thanks. Gwen leaves the office and walks through the police station. INTERCUT WITH : images of the drawing of the knife as she walks.\nEXT. A ROOF CAR PARK - LATER\nGwen and PC Andy stand. PC Andy is telling an anecdote, Gwen is not listening, she is thinking about the knife.\nINT. GWEN'S FLAT - LATER THAT DAY\nRhys is preparing dinner, Gwen sits at the table. Gwen is not really listening to Rhys; again thinking of the knife. She appears to be remembering seeing it before. Rhys talks while handing out dinner.\nINT. GWEN'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT\nGwen lies in bed thinking about the knife. The alarm clock reads 2.01. She gets out of bed and goes to her study. She draws a picture of the knife on a piece of paper. She finishes it, looks at it, screws it up and throws it in the bin. She leans back in her chair. She sees the knife again. A magazine of events at the Millennium Centre on her desk attracts her attention. She has written 'remember' on the cover.\nEXT. IN FRONT OF MILLENNIUM CENTRE - NIGHT\nGwen is walking outside the millennium centre, she sees a figure near the fountain, the figure appears as Suzie and Gwen remembers the knife. She then remembers a welding mask, and Suzie removing the mask. Gwen does not yet remember clearly.\nSUZIE : Hello again. You were right, you told Jack we should liaise with the police I was the only one who bothered, so, I was the only who saw the report. Suzie pulls the knife out of her bag.\nSUZIE : You got a good likeness.\nGWEN : I'm arresting you for... How do I know you ?\nSUZIE : I thought you might've seen it and that can trick the amnesia, just one specific image if you're clever. He said you were good. Anyway it's not much good now, I can't really... She gestures with the knife.\nSUZIE : You're going to put up a fight so I've got... She searches her handbag.\nSUZIE : Erm hold on... sorry. She pulls out a gunand drops her bag.\nSUZIE : There that's better. She points the gun at Gwen and cocks it. Gwen looks terrified.\nGWEN : Put it down...\nSUZIE : You had to come back...\nGWEN : Put don't the gun.\nSUZIE : You're the only one who can make the link...well the only one in public. Torchwood's gonna find out by morning, but I'll be gone. I don't know where, far away... What am I going to do ? I loved this job, I really loved it. And now I've got run. Oh, Christ ! How can you do any other job after this ?\nGWEN : Please put down the gun.\nSUZIE : It gets inside you, you do this job for long enough and you end up thinking... how come we get all the, the weevils and bollocks and sh1t. Is that what alien life is ? Filth ? Then maybe there's better stuff out there, brilliant stuff, beautiful stuff. Just... But they don't come here. This planet's so dirty, that's all we get, the sh1t.\nGWEN : I don't know what you're talking about.\nSUZIE : I wish I could forget.\nGWEN : Why did you kill those people ?\nSUZIE : For the glove. Suzie steps forward.\nGWEN : Just stay where you are.\nSUZIE : I needed the bodies, that's how it works, violent death. It was so easy. To bring them back I just positioned myself behind the head so they never see me twice.\nGWEN : You killed 3 people.\nSUZIE : It was the only way. The more I use the glove, the more I control it...\nGWEN : I don't understand what glove ? Where have I seen you before ?\nSUZIE : If I can get enough practise, then think what the glove could do. If I could get it to work all the time, on anything, beyond two minutes, if I could get it to work permanently, it could resurrect. Resurrection on demand for the whole world, isn't that good ? Jack rises up on the invisible lift between them.\nSUZIE : Isn't it though ? Well that's what I've been working for. All day, all night, the rest of them go swanning about while I'm working. You gotta get inside this stuff. Surrender yourself to it, I did with the knife and the glove, and that's why the perception filter isn't going to work on me... Suzie turns and shoots Jack in the forehead, he collapses. Gwen is shocked, he seems to have appeared from nowhere.\nGWEN : What... who is he ? Where did he come from ? What have you done... Suzie points the gun at Gwen and cocks it.\nGWEN : Please don't...\nSUZIE : I can't let you go. She steps over Jack's body and towards Gwen.\nGWEN : Please...\nSUZIE : I've got to... Gwen begins to sob in fear, hands clutching her hair.\nSUZIE : I'm sorry, I've got, I've got to... I've got to... Jack stands up behind Suzie. A bullet wound in this forehead heals as Gwen watches.\nJACK : Put down the gun. Suzie turns to look at Jack.\nJACK : Suzie, it's over, now come with me... Jack offers her his hand to Suzie. Gwen looks on disbelieving. Suzie turns to look at Gwen and then puts the gun under her chin and pulls the trigger, she collapses, instantly dead.\nGWEN : I... remember. I remember. Gwen falls to the floor.\nINT. JACK'S OFFICE THE HUB - LATER THAT NIGHT\nIanto puts the glove and the knife into a secure box tagged \"not for use\" and puts the box in Jack's safe. Owen and Toshiko put the alien devices they had taken onto Jack's desk.\nINT. TORCHWOOD MORGUE\nJack zips up Suzie's body bag, puts it into one of the many freezer units and walks away.\nEXT. ROOF OF MILLENNIUM CENTRE - DAWN\nJack and Gwen are standing on the roof talking.\nGWEN : Owen and Toshiko, you didn't tell them that you were shot in the head and survived.\nJACK : You didn't tell them either. Followed my lead. Keep doing that and you might just get through this.\nGWEN : But she killed you...\nJACK : I can't die.\nGWEN : Ok...\nJACK : But I can't... Something happened to me a while back, long story and far away. But I was killed, and then I was brought back to life and ever since then, I can't die.\nGWEN : But how ?\nJACK : I dunno. One day I'll find a doctor, the right sort of doctor and maybe he can explain it, but until then...\nGWEN : Nothing kills you ?\nJACK : Well, kinda freaks people out, so, best if you don't say anything.\nGWEN : It doesn't matter anyway, you'll only wipe my memory again.\nJACK : Why would I do that ? Torchwood's got a vacancy. Job going spare, do you want it ?\nGWEN : But... what do you need me for ?\nJACK : Because maybe you were right, we could do more to help. What do you think ? Wanna join up ?\nGWEN : ...Yeah. Gwen turns to look at the city. Jack smiles.\nGWEN : I do yes.\nCLOSING ARIEL VIEW OF MILLENNIUM CENTRE\nThe pterodactyl flies over the centre.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

However, Suzie is killed by Gwen, who is unaware of her true identity. After Suzie's death, Jack and Gwen discover that Suzie had been working with a group of time-travellers called the Time Agents, who are trying to prevent the death of Jack. The Time Agents use a device called the \"Time Scoop\" to steal people from the past and bring them to the present to prevent their deaths.

After pinning them on, Addison pats them for good measure.)\n(Burke is speaking with a nurse.) Burke: Are you sure my scrub caps weren't in the laundry delivery?\nNurse: I triple-checked.\nBurke: You're sure?\nNurse: Yeah, I'm sure.\nMVO: Studying might have been a better idea. She flunked out her sophomore year. But the fact is we all have little superstitious things that we do.\n(Derek is getting ready to start operating)\nDerek: All right, everybody. It's a beautiful morning to save lives. Let's have some fun.\nMVO: If it's not believing in magic statues, it's avoiding sidewalk cracks, or always putting out left shoe on first.\n(Bailey is at an operating table, she takes a few breaths before starting)\nBailey: Ok.\nMVO: Knock on wood.\nBailey: Ten blade.\n(Addison and Meredith's surgery)\nMVO: Step on a crack, break your mother's back.\n(A blood vessel bursts and the monitor starts beeping)\n(Burke's OR)\nBurke: Paddles.\n(Cristina hands him the interior heart paddles)\nBurke: Ten joules.\n(The monitor starts beeping)\n(Derek's OR)\nAnesthesiologist: He's having a reaction. I have to take him off.\nDerek: I'm in the middle of his brain.\n(Monitor starts beeping)\n(Bailey's OR)\nBailey: We're losing him.\n(Monitor starts beeping)\n(Derek's OR. A nurse is removing his head gear, the patient has obviously died.)\n(Burke's OR. A nurse is removing his head gear, the patient has obviously died.)\n(Bailey's OR, the patient has obviously died)\nBailey: Time of death...\n(Burke's OR)\nBurke: Time of death...\n(Derek's OR)\nDerek: Time of death...\n(Addison's OR)\nAddison: Call it, Grey.\nMVO: The last thing we want to do is offend the gods.\nMeredith: Time of death 8:17.\n(The interns are in the locker room, changing.)\nGeorge: Four surgeries, four fatalities and the day has barely started. (To Cristina) Can I have a bite of that?\nCristina: No. You're in my apartment, you don't get to be in my food.\nGeorge: Dr. Burke gave me a protein bar, this morning.\nCristina: Burke packs his lunch for him. Did I mention?\nIzzie: I talked to the morgue guy this morning.\nMeredith: The one with the unibrow?\nIzzie: The one with the like teeth thing. And he said that surgical fatalities come in threes and sevens. Says there'll be three more before midnight.\nCristina: Well, ok then. Since \"dead tooth\" morgue guy said so.\nIzzie: He's the morgue guy. He knows things about death.\n(Meredith picks up something from the floor and tries to hand it to George)\nMeredith: You dropped this. (George doesn't take it and walks away) He's still ignoring me.\nCristina: Ignore him back.\nMeredith: Derek says I should apologize until he listens.\nCristina: Derek says?\nMeredith: It's good advice. He's my friend. That's good friend advice.\n(Alex walks up and pulls Izzie aside)\nIzzie: What?\nAlex: Did you sneak out last night?\nIzzie: Yeah. I, um...I couldn't sleep.\n(Bailey enters)\nBailey: Come on.\nMeredith: Where?\nBailey: ER.\nGeorge: All of us?\nBailey: We've all had deaths. Let's all go save a life.\n(They all begin walking through the hall, as they walk by the nurse's station Addison stops them.)\nAddison: Uh, Dr. Bailey. (Hands her a cup) Here you go.\nBailey: What's this?\nAddison: Hot cocoa. It's a little ritual we had in New York. Four surgeries, four deaths, I figure we could all use a little good juju.\nBailey: And cocoa equals juju how?\nAddison: Hey, hey, hey. Don't question the cocoa. Carry on. (They all start to walk away, Meredith is trailing behind.) Meredith. (Hands her a cup) Thank you for your help this morning.\nMeredith: Oh. Thank you, Addison.\nAddison: Yeah. Thank you.\n(Derek observes the exchange between Meredith and Addison. After Meredith leaves he walks up.)\nAddison: Here you go. (She hands him a cup)\nDerek: Juju.\nAddison: Yep.\nDerek: You jujued Meredith.\nAddison: I did. In the spirit of friendship.\nDerek: Hmm.\nAddison: What? Are we not being friends with Meredith anymore?\nDerek: No, no, we are. Meredith and I are friends.\nAddison: And you and I are married. So then, by proxy, Meredith and I are friends.\nDerek: That's very big of you.\nAddison: Yeah.\nDerek: You don't have to do that. It's not like I'm gonna be friends with let's say, uh...Mark.\nAddison: Yeah, well, neither am I. Now finish your juju before somebody else dies.\nDerek: Hmm.\n(Meredith enters a room where she throws away the cup of juju.)\n(Burke is walking through the hallway talking on his cell phone.)\nBurke: There are ten of them. Music notes. Colorful patterns. They were sent out last night.\n(Burke walks up to the OR board where Richard is standing)\nRichard: Sorry to hear about your valve replacement, this morning.\nBurke: The laundry misplaced my scrub caps.\nRichard: You know, there's some foolish talk going around about fatality clusters in threes and sevens.\nBurke (On phone): Look, are you sure they weren't sent to another hospital?\nRichard: (To Nurse who is erasing the OR board) How many electives have they canceled today?\nNurse: This is our third.\nRichard: And what have the surgeons' been giving as their reasons?\nBurke (On phone): Because I prefer my own caps.\nRichard: You're not pushing your surgeries because you don't have your personal caps. You understand me?\nBurke (Looking confused): I didn't push any surgeries. (On phone) No, no. The question is: when will you find them?\n(Burke walks away)\nRichard: No one changes that board unless they talk to me. No one.\n(Bailey and her interns are gathered around a silent ER)\nCristina: Great. No blood, no guts, no lives to save. It's dead quiet.\nBailey: Did you really just say that?\nIzzie: Cristina...\nCristina: What?\nGeorge: You said the Q-word.\nIzzie: It's like saying Macbeth in theater.\nCristina: Please. You think because someone says it's quiet that it'll mean...\n(ER doors open)\nWoman: Can somebody help us here? She's coughing up blood.\nBailey: O'Malley! Take that.\n(Everyone's pagers start beeping)\nAlex: Denny Duquette.\nIzzie: I got it.\nAlex: He's my patient.\nBailey: He's both your patients. Answer the call.\nNurse: Two incoming.\n(Ambulance bay)\nBailey: Ok, uh, Yang, first one's yours. Grey, take number two.\nParamedic: Jesse Fannon, 32, unrestrained driver in a rear end collision. There was spider webbing on the front windshield where his head hit. BP's 120 palp. Pulse 75.\nBailey: Well, what do you want to do, Yang?\n(Man is counting on his fingers)\nCristina: Primary and secondary survey. Uh, head CT and X-ray.\nBailey: Ok. Page Shepherd when you get there.\nJesse: Wait! I'm counting the siren whoops. We can't go until it reaches 33.\nParamedic: He also seems to have a touch of OCD.\n(Other ambulance)\nParamedic: Nikki Ratlin, 30, erratic BP in the field. Complaining of chest and leg pain.\nMeredith: What happened?\nNikki: I got struck by lightning.\nCristina: Can anyone spell coincidence?\n(ER)\nNikki: My horoscope said, \"Stay close to home today.\" Aries couldn't have been any clearer. Ok, I guess it could have said, \"Don't leave the house today unless you want to get struck by lightning.\" Ouch.\nBailey: See, Ms. Ratlin, you have no sign of wounds from lightning.\nNikki: It was a sign. Clearly getting struck by lightning is a sign. I sign that I shouldn't have left my house.\nMeredith: Nikki, normally people struck by lightning have a wound where the bolt entered and exited the body.\nNikki: Well...well, I wasn't struck struck. The tree was struck and it fell on me.\nMeredith: A tree fell on you?\nNikki: A big, like, branch or limb, Whatever. Same difference.\n(Bailey scribbles on the paper that she had been writing on and crumbles it up.)\nBailey: No, actually, medically, it isn't the same difference. And it would be helpful if from now on you told us the whole truth.\nNikki: You want to know the truth? My boyfriend loves that tree. He's totally going to freak out. Ow.\n(George runs up to Richard in the hall)\nGeorge: Chief? There's a Ms. Warner down in Admitting. She's asking for you.\nRichard: Who?\n(Richard and George get in the elevator)\nGeorge: Um, Olive Warner? Fifties. Uh, blonde hair. She said she's known you for about 20 years.\nRichard: Are you talking about Ollie?\nGeorge: Right. Ok. Uh, Ollie Warner. She presented with upper GI bleeding. And she had a TIPSS procedure last month for esophageal varices.\n(Richard and George exit the elevator, he walks up the woman who had been coughing up blood.)\nRichard: I'll take this from here, O'Malley.\nGeorge: Happy to help, sir.\nRichard: No, thank you. I got this myself. (To Woman) Ollie.\nOllie: Hi, Richard. Good to see you.\n(Alex and Izzie are in Denny's room)\nAlex: Sinus tachycardia, low-grade fever, pulse ox 75.\nIzzie: I'm hearing rales in your lungs.\nDenny: Yeah. A freight train rolls through at noon.\nIzzie: How bad is the pain?\nDenny: I don't know. A five or six when I breathe.\nAlex: Which means a seven or eight when you're not trying to impress your doctor.\nDenny: Heard, uh, four people died in surgery this morning. Sid they were expecting three more.\nAlex: You get that from a nurse?\nDenny: Never reveal my sources. Just like to avoid the OR. (Alex and Izzie exchange looks) And I'm not liking that look.\n(Izzie sits on the edge of Denny's bed)\nIzzie: This could be a pulmonary embolism, Denny. A complication from the LVAD surgery. We gonna have to talk to Dr. Burke.\n(Alex clears his throat and Izzie stands up)\n(Meredith and Cristina are in the elevator with their patients)\nMeredith: I got hot chocolated. The She-Shepherd hot chocolated me. It's her juju.\nCristina: I don't like people who say juju.\nNikki: I say juju.\nJesse: Juju, juju, juju. Juju, juju, juju. Juju, juju, juju.\nMeredith: I didn't drink it.\nJesse: Juju, juju, juju.\nNikki: You're not obligated to honor someone else's juju.\nJesse: Juju, juju, juju.\nCristina: Thought you were being friends.\nJesse: Juju, juju, juju.\nMeredith: I am. With him. Do I have to be friends with her too?\nJesse: Juju, juju, juju.\nNikki: Definitely not.\nJesse: Juju, juju, juju.\nCristina: Maybe.\nJesse. Juju, juju, juju.\nMeredith: I'll, uh, call psych for you.\nCristina: That'd be good. Thanks.\nNikki (Screaming): Ow! Ow!\n(Callie is setting Nikki's broken leg.)\nCallie: All right. That's the worst of it.\nNikki: Oh, I never should have gotten out of bed. But I really wanted to surprise my boyfriend before he left for school. He had a huge exam today and I just, you know, I wanted to wish him luck.\n(George enters the room)\nGeorge: Dr. Torres. Hey. Hi. Uh, can I give you a hand?\nCallie: You missed the boat, George.\nGeorge: You mean on this case or...?\nCallie: Or...a hot chick gives you her number, you're supposed to call.\nNikki: Yeah.\nGeorge: I...I was...I mean, I am.\nCallie: Too late.\nNikki: Ouch. Don't give up. I mean, if you really like her.\n(Meredith enters)\nGeorge: Uh...ok.\n(George leaves)\nNikki: Ok, the plot thickens.\nCallie: Nikki, Dr. Grey here is going to take you upstairs for a CT. But before she does, I have to ask: you're bruised all up and down your left side. You sure a tree branch did all this?\nNikki: You think my boyfriend did this? He would never hit a woman. Ever.\nCallie: Mm-hmm. The bruises doesn't look like a tree branch hit you.\nNikki: Fine. Ok, you guys are going to think I'm really weird, but I was sort of up in the tree when the lightning hit. And...I fell.\nCallie: You climbed a tree in a thunderstorm?\nNikki: I really wanted it to be a surprise, you know, for my boyfriend. And...um, I just...I had to see if his psycho dog was in the yard because of, like, the barking and stuff and...I know. It sounds really weird. Does it sound really weird?\nMeredith: Not at all.\nCallie: No.\nNikki: and this thing is, I mean, he wasn't even there.\nMeredith: The dog?\nNikki: No. My boyfriend. He wasn't even home. I really shouldn't have gotten out of bed.\n(Derek walks by Cristina, she stops him)\nCristina: Oh, Dr. Shepherd. I've got a 34-year-old male with a blunt head trauma and severe case of OCD.\nDerek: Oh, really. Did you call for a psych consult?\nCristina: Yes.\nDerek: Let me know when you get a CT.\nCristina: Ok.\nDerek: Thank you.\n(Derek walks away and Burke walks up)\nBurke: Hey.\nCristina: Hey. Hey, uh, sorry about that, uh, valve replacement.\nBurke: Oh, thank you. Laundry lost my caps.\nCristina: The guy didn't die because you weren't wearing one of your caps.\nBurke: I know that. I just prefer to operate wearing my own. It's a comfort thing.\nCristina: Huh, well...I prefer having George out of our apartment. So I guess we both have comfort things.\nBurke: Yeah, what are you saying?\nCristina: Uh, you know, um...I have one of your caps in my locker.\nBurke: Why do you have one of my caps...\nCristina: That's not the point. You know, the point is, um, is that I think I'm going to keep it hostage. So you kick Bambi out and you get your cap back.\nBurke: Oh, well. I don't do well with ultimatums.\nCristina: Maybe you should think of it more as a...trade.\n(Cristina walks away and George exits the elevator)\nGeorge: Dr. Burke. I've got free time. Do you have any cases, do you need help...\nBurke: Actually, I do.\n(They both get into the elevator)\nBurke: Cristina has something of mine and I need you to get it back.\n(Richard enters Ollie's room. A young lady is in the room with Ollie.)\nRichard: Gretchen, would you mind leaving us alone for a minute?\nGretchen: Ok.\nRichard: Thank you.\nOllie: She's my new baby. Six months sober, she's already on the ninth step.\nRichard: You must be proud.\nOllie: Always.\nRichard: You're on a transplant list, Ollie?\nOllie: A couple of years now.\nRichard: The cirrhosis prevents blood from flowing into your liver. So it's backing up into your esophagus. Causing the ruptures. It's serious, Oll.\nOllie: Well, of course it is. I mean, you don't puke blood if it's not serious. The question is: can you treat it?\nRichard: Maybe. Surgically. We'll have to run more tests and...whatever we do, it's a stop-gap. You need a new liver.\nOllie: Yet another reason I should've laid off the sauce. You look scared.\nRichard: I am scared, Ollie.\nOllie: Haven't seen you at a meeting in a while.\nRichard: I know, I know.\nOllie: How've you been?\nRichard: We're talking about you.\nOllie: Now I'm asking about you.\nRichard: Ellis Grey's daughter's working at the hospital. Ellis is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. I try to go see her every chance I get.\nOllie: You're having an affair with the woman who drove you to your alcoholic bottom.\nRichard: Ollie, we're not having an affair. She's sick.\nOllie: You're lying to your wife?\nRichard: I'm not lying.\nOllie: You're lying by omission. You are having an emotional affair. And now you're lying to your sponsor about it.\nRichard: You haven't been my sponsor in years.\nOllie: I still have the right to bust your ass if I see you slipping.\nRichard: I'm not slipping.\nOllie: Not yet. But you're making a pretty big mess. (Richard stands up and sighs) How many years you have now?\nRichard: Just passed 17.\nOllie: I'm proud of you. And I'm scared too.\nRichard: You got me sober, Ollie. You walked me through it. (He takes her hand) And I'm going to walk you through this.\n(George is digging through Cristina's locker)\nGeorge: Ok. That's...\n(Cristina enters the locker room)\nGeorge: She still has...\nCristina: You're a pervy little boy, George. And you're not finding the cap.\nGeorge: I'll do your dishes for a month.\nCristina: I don't do dishes.\nGeorge: I'll do your laundry.\nCristina: I don't do laundry.\nGeorge: Maybe that's why Burke likes having me around.\nCristina: Interesting, interesting. Are you having s*x with him?\nGeorge: No.\nCristina: Then he likes having me around more.\nGeorge: Why's it always have to be a competition? What do you want for the cap?\nCristina: You out of the apartment.\nGeorge: I'm not leaving until Burke says I have to leave.\nCristina: Then you're not getting the cap. Now clean up my crap.\nGeorge: No.\n(Bailey and Meredith are looking at CT scans)\nMeredith: Wow. Is that her spleen?\nBailey: Looks like a grade three laceration. Maybe a four. What was she doing standing under a tree in a thunderstorm?\nMeredith: She wasn't standing under it. She was climbing it.\nBailey: Why?\nMeredith: Uh...I'm getting the feeling she's a little bit of a stalker.\nBailey: Do we need to call the police?\nMeredith: I don't think so. I think she's more a gentle stalker than a \"kill you with a knife\" stalker.\nBailey: Right. Well, let's hope she lives to gently stalk another day.\nMeredith: Hey, you don't believe in that seven fatality thing, do you?\nBailey: I believe this girl needs her spleen removed immediately. Go pick up the labs and get her on the board. Then we'll break the news.\n(Denny is breathing heavily, on a OR table)\nIzzie: It's almost over.\nDenny: You like horses, Izzie?\nIzzie: Everybody likes horses.\nDenny: That's not true. You know, horses are a great judge of character. You don't like horses, means they don't like you.\nIzzie: Huh.\nAlex: I've got an uncle that's a rodeo cowboy.\nDenny: Huh. No kidding.\nBurke: This is a big clot, Denny. I can't get it with the catheter. I'm sorry. We're gonna have to open your chest again.\n(Cristina is taking Jesse to CT)\nJesse: I was counting the clicks. The...turn signal clicks. I couldn't move until it hit 333. The light was green, but I couldn't move. I can't blame them for hitting me.\nRaj: How long have you been feeling these compulsions?\nJesse: A little bit all my life, but it's been out of control the last three years.\nRaj: Onset at 30 is typical.\nJesse: Ruined a marriage. I can't hold a job...\nCristina: Ok, Mr. Fannon, do you...\nJesse: Is it clean? I need to know if it's clean.\nCristina: It's very clean.\nRaj: Any relatives with OCD?\nJesse: My mother. Killed herself at 38. Ruined her life. Now it's ruining mine.\n(Cristina clears her throat)\nJesse: Clean, clean, clean?\nCristina: Uh, we clean it between each patient.\nRaj: I think he needs you to say \"clean, clean, clean.\"\nCristina: It's clean, clean, clean.\nJesse: Thank you. I know it's annoying. I can't help it.\n(Cristina walks past the window and sees George watching from the other side)\nJesse: Uh, find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck. Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck.\nCristina: Ok, Mr. Fannon, do you...\nJesse: Find a penny...\nRaj: Repetitive rhymes, prayers. It's classic. He needs to say it a specific number of times. Probably a multiple of three.\nCristina: Let's get him in before he decides to start again.\nRaj: Is everything all right with, uh...that?\n(Raj nods to the window where George has his face pressed against it)\nJesse: Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck.\nCristina: Just, uh, don't look at him.\n(Meredith is walking through the halls, highlighting a book. She walks up to Derek, at the same time Addison exits a nearby elevator.)\nMeredith: Hey.\nDerek: Hi.\nMeredith: Hey...\nAddison: Oh, hey.\nMeredith: Hi.\nDerek: Hi.\nMeredith: I, uh...have to...\nDerek: Yeah.\nAddison: Yeah.\n(Meredith walks away)\nDerek: I do too.\n(Derek walks away)\nAddison: Yeah, I got...something too, so...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Richard is in Ollie's room, talking to Ollie and Gretchen.)\nRichard: I wish I had good news. The TIPSS procedure you had last month failed.\nGretchen: What does that mean?\nOllie: It means you're lucky you got sober young.\nRichard: Ollie, it means I'm going to have to put in a portacaval shunt. It's complicated. It has only a 50% survival rate.\nOllie: What's my other choice? (Richard just looks at her) Ok, then. Um...you'll be the one to do it?\nRichard: I've performed this surgery nine times. Had four patients survive.\nOllie: It's perfect then. I'll be your five out of ten.\n(Bailey and Meredith enter Nikki's room)\nNikki: I'm not having surgery today.\nBailey: You have a ruptured spleen.\nNikki: And I'm sure that the spleen is very important. But I'm not having surgery today. You can operate after midnight but not one minute before.\nBailey: Miss Ratlin, if I thought it would be safe I'd be more than happy to wait until after midnight. However, I have a husband and a baby at home who won't be happy. You know who else won't be happy? You. Your spleen is bleeding. Spleen trumps horoscope.\nNikki: But it was more than just my horoscope. I went out to my car this morning. Flat tire. That's a sign, but I just changed the tire. Then there's a wreck on the freeway. Do I turn around and go home like it's telling me to? No, I detour an hour out of my way so that I can get to Kevin's house. And when I get to Kevin's house, I get struck by lightning!\nMeredith: But you weren't struck by lightning.\nNikki: I'll die, ok? If you operate on my today I will die because I know I will. Please, just...just call my boyfriend and tell him that I'm having an operation at midnight. Because he will want to be here.\nMeredith: Ok.\nNikki: Please.\n(Bailey and Meredith start walking out of the room.)\nMeredith: Should I call psych?\nBailey: You can give it a shot. In the meanwhile, get her down to ICU. Poor girl's going to kill herself trying not to die.\n(Alex is drawing Denny's blood)\nAlex: Izzie paints a pretty picture because she likes you, you know?\nDenny: Ok.\nAlex: I'm just saying she likes you. Which is going to be hard on her.\nDenny: You mean...when I die? Come on. I'm asking you...man-to-man.\nAlex: With a clot in your pulmonary artery, it'll cut off the oxygen to your lungs and you'll die of hypoxia. If the hypoxia doesn't kill you, the strain on your heart will.\nDenny: And the surgery?\nAlex: It's not a routine procedure. You're at serious risk for bleeding because of the anticoagulants already in your system. What I'm saying is Izzie likes you. And she's not going to be the one to pull away.\n(Meredith and Cristina are at the lunch table in the outdoor cafeteria.)\nMeredith: How's your guy?\nCristina: Brain's bleeding. Needs surgery. Want to know why? Because he couldn't move his car until he stopped counting.\nMeredith: My girl? Ruptured spleen? Won't have surgery because of her horoscope.\nCristina: Oh, well, we should introduce them. They make a nice crazy couple.\n(George walks up and sits down)\nCristina: Uh, you know what? I'm sitting with Meredith. Have some self-respect.\nGeorge: Dr. Burke's orders trump any personal issues I might have.\nMeredith: Is the craziness rubbing off on him?\nCristina: He's trying to...stalk Burke's lucky cap from me.\nMeredith: Burke has hat juju?\nCristina: Apparently.\nMeredith: And you're using it against him?\nCristina: Well, they're forcing me to. Because of the clarinet playing and the running and all the breakfast food.\n(Izzie walks up and sits down)\nIzzie: You guys, this whole death cluster thing is just ridiculous, right? I mean, just cause four died today doesn't necessarily mean there'll be three more before midnight.\nCristina: It doesn't, Tinkerbell? For reals?\nMeredith: Are you worried about Denny?\nIzzie: Yeah. Of course I am. He's my patient. I mean, but if you're asking me if I'm \"worried\" about Denny, no. I'm sleeping with Alex, so...it's just...Hey, did Burke say anything to you...about Denny's surgery? Did he...?\nCristina: No. It's your case.\nIzzie: Yeah. I know. I'm just asking that, you know, as your boyfriend, if...\nCristina: I don't know why you'd care. You're sleeping with Alex, right?\nIzzie: Yeah.\nCristina: Yeah.\nIzzie: Right. No, whatever. I'm just saying. There's no such thing as a death cluster. It's just stupid. Right?\nMeredith: I have to go convince my patient to let us operate.\nCristina: Mm-hmm.\n(Cristina and Derek are talking with Jesse)\nJesse: You're removing part of my skullcap? Do you really have to do that?\nDerek: It's the only way I can get to the affected part of the brain.\nJesse: And the operating room, it's clean, clean, clean?\nDerek: Yes. It's clean, clean, clean. I'm gonna go get ready.\n(Derek leaves, Jesse starts clicking the light on and off)\nCristina: Can you stop that, please?\nJesse: No. Sorry. I wish I could.\n(Cristina moves to reveal George standing behind her.)\nJesse (to George): She's judging me.\nGeorge: No, she's not.\nCristina: Yes, she is. I've been living with this for three years. And it's always the people who are most like me who judge me the most. You're type A, right? Straight A student? Top of your class?\nCristina: Yes, I was.\nJesse: So, you've managed to turn your compulsions into something productive. But we're cut from the same cloth. That's why you can't stand me.\nCristina: Oh. Time to go.\nJesse: But I'm not done.\nCristina: Uh, yes you are, sir.\nGeorge: How many do you have to do?\nJesse: 96.\nGeorge: Let him finish.\nCristina: Fine. I'll see you in the OR.\n(Ollie, Gretchen and a group of people are in her room. Richard walks by the window. )\nOllie: Oh, there's Richard.\n(Gretchen exits the room)\nGretchen: Hey. Ollie says you should come in. She says you need a meeting.\nRichard: Not now. Not here.\nGretchen: Yeah. Except she said to tell you not to protect your anonymity over your sobriety.\n(Richard follows Gretchen into the room, he closes the door behind him)\nAll: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Amen.\nRichard: Amen.\n(Denny is in the hallway prepped for surgery. Izzie walks up to him.)\nIzzie: Hey. How you feeling?\nDenny: Do me a favor? My will is inside my nightstand. Just make sure it gets in the right hands, ok?\nIzzie: Why are you talking about your will?\nDenny: We have to be realistic, Dr. Stevens.\nIzzie: Dr. Stevens?\nDenny: We got to be realistic. And if you can't, well, I can.\nIzzie (to Doctors): No, wait, um...can you wait just one minute? Denny, Denny, listen to me. You're not going to die. You can't go into surgery thinking your going to die.\n(Cristina enters the women's bathroom, George follows her.)\nCristina: You want me to pee in front of you, is that what you want?\nGeorge: You have it on you.\nCristina: Oh, really? You want to go there?\nGeorge: I wanna go there.\nCristina: So, what are you going to do, Bambi? You gonna what, take it from me?\nGeorge: Burke said to do whatever I have to do and I'm going to do whatever.\n(George starts grabbing Cristina)\nCristina: George, it's not there. You're not getting it. Oh! No. No, you're not going to...No.\n(Callie exits a bathroom stall, looking confused.)\nCristina: No. Oh! You've got my breast. That's my breast. That's my breast. My breast.\n(Callie starts washing her hands. They realize that someone is in the bathroom and stop fighting.)\nGeorge: Hey, Dr. Torres.\nCallie: Dr. O'Malley, You're aware this is the women's restroom?\nGeorge: Yes, ma'am.\nCallie: Good.\n(Callie leaves)\nCristina: Dude. You called her ma'am. She's never going to sleep with you now.\n(George is in the hall and bumps into Izzie.)\nGeorge: Oh, hey. Have you seen Burke?\nIzzie: He's on the phone with the laundry. They still can't find his scrub caps.\nGeorge: That's what I got to tell him. Cristina won't give hers back. Unless I'm ready to hit a woman. And even though it's Cristina, I'm not ready to cross that line.\nIzzie: Wait! Wait, a moment. Cristina has one of Burke's scrub caps?\nGeorge: She's holding it hostage. Why do you think I am stalking her? You...\n(Izzie runs off. She walks up behind Cristina, grabs her arm and pulls her into an office.)\nCristina: Uh, ow. You're touching me.\nIzzie: George says you have Burke's scrub cap.\nCristina: So?\nIzzie: Give it to him.\nCristina: No.\nIzzie: Give it to him, Cristina.\nCristina: What is with you?\nIzzie: He needs it to operate.\nCristina: No, he doesn't.\nIzzie: That isn't your decision to make. Not when he's going in on Denny. Now, are you gonna give it to him or am I gonna physically take it from you?\nCristina: Are you threatening me?\nIzzie: I swear to God, Cristina, I like you, I really do. But I grew up in a trailer park and I am not about kicking your pampered little Beverly Hills ass. And I do mean physically kicking your ass.\n(Cristina and Izzie walk up to Burke.)\nCristina: You don't have to follow me.\n(Izzie gives her a look and walks away. Cristina hands the scrub cap to Burke.)\nBurke: Well, thank you. How long have you had this? It's one of my favorites.\nCristina: You know, you don't need it. I keep that cap in my locker because every morning I look at it and I'm reminded of what I'm here for and what I want to be. A great surgeon. A surgeon who is decisive, and who executes, and who doesn't need a piece of clothing to give him an edge in surgery. You don't need it.\nBurke: I know. You're right.\nCristina: I know I'm right.\n(Cristina walks away. Burke puts the scrub cap on and starts to head toward surgery. He passes George on the way.)\nBurke: Nicely done, O'Malley. Let's go scrub in.\n(Meredith is examining Nikki.)\nNikki: How am I doing?\nMeredith: Nikki, is it possible you're misreading the signs? I mean, isn't two surgeons telling you that you need surgery a sign that you need surgery?\nNikki: Did you call my boyfriend?\nMeredith: I did.\nNikki: What'd he say?\nMeredith: He said he hasn't been your boyfriend in a while.\nNikki: Did you tell him I got struck by lightning?\n(Scrub outside Denny's surgery. Alex is there and Izzie enters.)\nIzzie: What did you say to him?\nAlex: Who?\nIzzie: You know who. What the hell? Why does Denny think he's dying?\nAlex: Well, maybe because there's a good chance he is.\nIzzie: Just so we're clear. We're over, Alex. This is over.\nAlex: What? You're breaking up with me over a corpse?\nIzzie: No! No. I am breaking up with you because on your very best day...that corpse is twice the man you will ever be. You're not good enough for me, Alex. You're not good enough for anyone.\n(Burke enters and realizes something is going on.)\nBurke: You two, you're not scrubbing in. Whatever's going on with you, I don't need it in my OR.\nAlex: Fine. I'll watch from the gallery.\nBurke: No, no, you won't. You will take your energy as far away from my OR as you can get.\n(Alex leaves)\nBurke: Both of you.\n(Izzie leaves and George and Burke start scrubbing in.)\n(Jesse is in the OR getting ready for surgery.)\nJesse: Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck. Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck. Find a penny, pick it up...\nCristina: We're going to give you your anesthetic now.\nJesse: all day long you'll have good luck. Find a penny, pick it up...\nCristina: I'm sorry but we have to start.\nJesse: Find a penny, pick it up...\n(Seattle scenes)\n(Derek is starting Jesse's surgery.)\nDerek: It's a beautiful afternoon to save lives, people. Lets have some fun.\n(Denny's OR, Burke and George get ready to start the surgery.)\n(Ollie's OR, Richard and Bailey get ready to start the surgery.)\nRichard: The incision begins along the left subcostal margin, across the right rectus, and extending well into the flank.\n(Meredith enters)\nMeredith: Dr. Bailey? It's Nikki Ratlin.\nRichard: I'll be all right, Bailey. Go.\n(Bailey and Meredith enter Nikki's room)\nBailey: She, uh...yeah, she's bleeding out. We need to get her to the OR now.\nNikki: I don't want an operation.\nMeredith: Nikki, your boyfriend called. He said he doesn't want you to die.\nNikki: Kevin called?\nMeredith: Yes. Will you let us operate?\n(She flatlines)\nMeredith: Nikki?\nBailey: Oh, code blue. Come on.\n(Bailey pressed the code button and code team rushes in.)\nBailey: Ok. Charge to 200.\nDoctor: 200.\nBailey: Clear.\n(Izzie is standing in front of the OR board, breathing deeply.)\n(Richard is operating on Ollie.)\nRichard: You have the back row of sutures in place. Give me some...clear field.\nDoctor: Pressure's dropping.\nRichard: Hang another unit. I need the field clear.\n(Nikki's room)\nBailey: Clear. Charge 300!\nDoctor: Charge.\nBailey: Clear.\n(Derek and Cristina are operating on Jesse.)\nDerek: Gel foam. That clip should've done it. I don't know. There's something I'm missing.\n(Burke is operating on Denny)\nDoctor: He's losing pressure, Dr. Burke.\nBurke: I'm working as fast as I can.\nGeorge: We're losing him.\n(Stairs near the OR board.)\nFemale Intern: I heard they're dying left and right.\nMale Intern: See? Told you there'd be seven.\nIzzie: Who? Who died?\nFemale Intern: Don't know. I bet it was that spleen chick. You hear she wouldn't let them operate.\nMale Intern: Ah, my money's on the chief's shunt.\nAlex: I have twenty says Burke's guy went down. Dude's a walking time bomb.\nMale Intern: Bet.\n(Meredith and Bailey walk up. Meredith erases Nikki from the OR board.)\nBailey: That makes five.\nIzzie: You lost her?\nMeredith: Yeah. I heard there's a number six.\nIzzie: Do you know who else?\nMeredith: No. I'm going to inform the family.\n(Richard walks out to the waiting room where Gretchen and a group of people are waiting.)\nRichard: She made it through.\n(Gretchen hugs him)\nGretchen: Thank you. Thank you so much.\nMan: Thank you.\nRichard: You're welcome. You're welcome.\n(Derek and Cristina leave the OR, Jesse didn't make it.)\nMVO: Superstition lies in the space between what we can control...\n(Izzie is standing in a room, tears streaking her face.)\nMVO: and what we can't.\nDenny: So, I wasn't one of the seven?\nIzzie: It's past midnight. There were only six.\nDenny: Then why are you crying?\nIzzie: I'm not crying.\nDenny: You are too.\nIzzie: Oh, damn it. I cannot fall for a patient.\nDenny: Oh. Ok. Good luck with that.\n(Izzie smiles then kisses Denny.)\nMVO: Find a penny, pick it up, and all day long you'll have good luck.\n(George enters the locker room, where all the interns are getting ready to go home. He scoffs when he sees Meredith.)\nAlex: O'Malley, you are a sad excuse for a man.\nGeorge: Excuse me?\nAlex: I know you heard me. You're like a whiny little girl.\nMeredith: Alex.\nAlex: You know why he's not speaking to you? Because he's not over you. Man, you got laid, it went badly. A man would move on. But you? You mope around this place like a dog that likes to get kicked. You make me sick, and if it wouldn't get me thrown out of the program, I'd smash your pathetic little face right into that locker.\nMVO: No one wants to pass up a chance for good luck. But does saying it 33 times really help?\n(Cristina is leaving the hospital.)\nMVO: Is anyone really listening?\n(Burke runs to catch up with her.)\nBurke: Hey. So if you feel that strongly about O'Malley, I'll ask him to leave tonight.\nCristina: No, no, don't.\nBurke: I thought you wanted him out.\nCristina: I do. But...not tonight.\n(Burke pulls the scrub cap out of his pocket.)\nBurke: Scrub cap.\nCristina: Oh. Thank you.\nBurke: You're welcome.\nMVO: And if no one's listening, why do we bother doing those strange things at all?\n(Callie is walking in the ER and runs into George.)\nGeorge: Hi. I didn't call. I should have called. I just...\n(Callie walks away. George takes out his phone and calls her.)\nGeorge: Hi. This is George O'Malley calling. You gave me your phone number. I know I should have called sooner, but I'm calling now. And I just want to know...maybe you want to go out with me sometime? Because...I...love to watch you set bones. And I...oh, I...rarely spend...that much time in a women's restroom. And I really like you. (Callie smiles at him)So...is that a yes?\nMVO: We rely on superstitions because we're smart enough to know we don't have all the answers.\n(Addison walks up to Meredith with two cups of coffee)\nAddison: Hey.\nMeredith: Hey.\nAddison: I'm sorry to hear about your patient.\nMeredith: Thank you, Addison.\nMVO: And that life works in mysterious ways.\n(She gives one cup to Meredith and then walks to where Derek is standing and hands him the other cup.)\nAddison: Here you go, babe.\nDerek: Thank you.\nAddison: Hmm. Ready?\n(He hands the cup back.)\nDerek: Yeah. Here you go. Thank you.\n(Derek and Meredith share a glance and then Derek walks away.)\nMVO: Don't diss the juju...from wherever it comes.\n(Meredith takes a sip of the coffee and throws the rest away.)\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": "  The text is a summary of the song \"The Luckiest\" by Ben Folds. The song is about a man who is trying to win back the love of a woman he once had a relationship with. The man is trying to do this by following a series of superstitious rituals, such as saying \"Find a penny, pick it up, and all day long you'll have good luck\" 33 times. The man is also trying to win back the woman's love by doing things that he knows she likes, such as watching her set bones and spending a lot of time in the women's restroom. The man is also trying to win back the woman's love by saying things that he knows will make her smile, such as saying \"I love to watch you set bones.\" The text is a summary of the song because it uses the same lyrics and the same general idea of a man trying to win back the love of a woman by following superstitious rituals.</s>【我为群众办实事】“我为群众办实事”实践活动—— 市妇联开展“巾帼心向党 奋斗新征程” 主题宣讲活动"

Then we see Meeker at the bridge.\nMEEKER: Going to manual.\nSILVEY: What for?\nMEEKER: Why not? If we're going to be slammed around, I'd sooner do it myself.\nSILVEY: It's still telling you what to do.\nMEEKER: Yes, but at least I'm doing it.\nSILVEY: Come on, Meeker.\nSAFRAN: You're off course.\nMEEKER: Yes, sorry, skipper.\nSAFRAN: Put it back on automatic, please.\nMeeker tries various controls and it's obvious there's a problem.\nMEEKER: Eh? I can't!\nSAFRAN: Titan shuttle captain. New course for Titan, please.\nHe climbs up toward Meeker.\nSAFRAN: All right, Meeker, that is enough.\nMEEKER: What?\nSAFRAN: Off watch. Please.\nSafran takes the pilot's seat.\nMEEKER: Look, I qualified for exploration eight years ago, and what am I? Glorified garage attendant on some planetary filling station.\nSILVEY: Your turn'll come. You'll be glad enough of refuel bases then.\nMEEKER: All I'm saying is that I want a real\nSAFRAN: Not now, Meeker.\nCOMPUTER: Unidentified organism. Changing course to avoid.\nThe shuttle is caught in some kind of weird webby thing with lightning.\nSAFRAN: What was all that about? There's nothing there. Titan shuttle captain. Report please.\nSilvey turns to the others.\nNUCLEUS (OOV.): Contact has been made.\nSAFRAN: Contact?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the TARDIS Leela carries the hatstand and sets it down. The Doctor enters.\nLEELA: We've never been in here before.\nDOCTOR: You've never been in here before.\nLEELA: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Number two control room has been closed for redecoration. I don't like the colour.\nLEELA: White isn't a colour.\nDOCTOR: That's the trouble with computers. Always think in black and white. No aquamarines, no blues, no imagination.\nLEELA: Have we stopped?\nDOCTOR: No, we haven't stopped.\nThe scanner opens.\nLEELA: Have we materialised?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nLEELA: Where?\nDOCTOR: Solar system, between Jupiter and Saturn. About five thousand AD. Five thousand AD? We're still in the time of your ancestors.\nLEELA: Ancestors?\nDOCTOR: Yes. That was the year of the great breakout.\nLEELA: The great what?\nDOCTOR: Mmm. When your forefathers went leapfrogging across the solar system on their way to the stars. Asteroid belt's probably teeming with them now. New frontiersmen, pioneers waiting to spread across the galaxy like a tidal wave. Or a disease.\nLEELA: Why disease? I thought you liked humanity?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I do, I do. Some of my best friends are humans. When they get together in great numbers, other lifeforms sometimes suffer.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe shuttle approaches Titan. We see the landing area as the shuttle comes in.\nCut to a close-up of gloved hands operating the controls of the shuttle. We see the shuttle coming down from its nosecone.\nThen we see the shuttle land on the pad and the pad begins to sink into the ground.\nThe hands switch off the controls.\nThe pad rotates, with the shuttle on board.\nThe pad begins to move carrying the shuttle with it.\nThe space-suited crew walk through the bridge (we can see through the shuttle cockpit window beyond).\nCOMPUTER: Docking. Docking. Contact. All locked.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAs the crew head through the door, they each take a blaster. They holster the blasters and go through the inner door.\nMAN (OOV.): Hey, are we glad to see you. Welcome to Titan. You're welcome to it. We're in the mess. Come on down.\nThe crew head toward the doors.\nThe first door is the wrong one, and the leader gestures to another when they hear laughter from behind it.\nThe door slides open.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMAN: Come on in. Join the party. Our last supper on Titan. Well, come on. Get your gear off and relax. You're going to be here for\nThe crew pull their blasters and aim at the three in the mess.\nMAN: Hey, what kind of a joke is ...\nThe crew fire at the men who fall to the floor dead. Safran lifts his visor.\nHis face is covered in green scales.\nSAFRAN: There is one other. The station supervisor. We must find him, destroy him.\nSAFRAN: Then we can make this the ideal place in which to breed and multiply.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLOWE: Shuttle relief crew. Shuttle relief crew. Come in, please. Shuttle relief crew, this is Supervisor Lowe. Please report. Relief crew, this is the supervisor. Where are you?\nHe activates a remote camera monitor to see what is happening in the mess.\nHe pans his camera around.\nLOWE: My God, what's happened? Hello? Hello?\nLOWE: What is it? What's gone wrong?\nSAFRAN: Wrong? There is nothing wrong. This is most suitable for our purpose. What, what purpose? Safran. Safran, is that you? What has happened?\nSAFRAN: Who is this Safran?\nLowe looks horrified.\nLOWE: Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! This is Titan Base. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!\nMeeker and Silvey approach through the halls and reach the supervisor's door as Lowe ducks into the IMURJINSEE EGSIT.\nThey burn through the lock and enter the room.\nMEEKER: The supervisor has escaped.\nSAFRAN: Leave him. Let him suffocate.\nSafran punches the distress signal to silence it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBack in the TARDIS Leela is practicing her handwriting on chalkboard.\nDOCTOR: As soon as I've reset these coordinates, we'll go somewhere really interesting.\nLOWE (OOV.): Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! This is Titan Base. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!\nLEELA: What was that?\nDOCTOR: Distress call. From Titan. That message took half an hour to get here.\nLEELA: Is Titan really interesting?\nDOCTOR: What does that matter? What's important is that someone needs help!\nWe briefly see the webby thing in space again. Then the Doctor is setting controls.\nDOCTOR: Quadrant six two. W H I one two one two nine nine zero E X four one. What's the matter?\nLEELA: I'm troubled.\nDOCTOR: About what?\nLEELA: I can feel something.\nDOCTOR: Hey.\nSAFRAN (OOV.): Titan. This is Titan Base. All vessels, repeat, all vessels disregard mayday. I say again, disregard mayday. All under control.\nDOCTOR: There we are.\nSAFRAN (OOV.): Our apologies. Our apologies.\nLEELA: That's it!\nDOCTOR: That's what?\nLEELA: That's something evil.\nSAFRAN (OOV.): Titan Base out.\nDOCTOR: What?\nLEELA: It was not a human speaking.\nDOCTOR: It wasn't?\nThe TARDIS gets caught in the webby stuff.\nThere is an explosion on the console as the Doctor leans over, and he briefly glows purple.\nLEELA: What was that?\nDOCTOR: Static. Nothing important.\nLEELA: There was a sort of glow all around you.\nDOCTOR: There was? Oh. Well, a kind of Saint Elmo's fire. It happens at sea.\nLEELA: Saint Elmo's?\nDOCTOR: Yes, it causes a sort of halo effect round the masts of ships.\nLEELA: Halo?\nDOCTOR: Why do you keep repeating everything I say? You're not a parrot, are you?\nLEELA: Parrot?\nDOCTOR: Yes. A parrot's a bird that repeats things. Move over.\nLEELA: (deep) Move over.\nDOCTOR: That's it.\nAnother explosion.\nLEELA: I thought you said there was nothing wrong.\nDOCTOR: Well, there isn't anything wrong. Well, there isn't anything important wrong, but I've got to check it, haven't I?\nLEELA: I can still feel it.\nDOCTOR: Come on, old thing. Come on.\nSomething zaps the Doctor's eyes.\nHe takes a step back and his vision blurs.\nNUCLEUS (OOV.): Contact has been made.\nHe falls to the floor.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBack on the base.\nSAFRAN: Incubation will start here.\nNUCLEUS (OOV.): Contact has been made. The nucleus has found a host. Prepare for his coming.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe TARDIS materializes.\nInside, Leela gets zapped in the eyes too, but it doesn't affect her.\nLEELA: Doctor, wake up. We've landed. We've materialised.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe crew approach the TARDIS down the corridor.\nSAFRAN: There is one other with the host. She has been rejected. We must destroy her and dispose of her body with the rest. Take up your positions.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe Doctor wakes up.\nDOCTOR: Hello, Lally.\nLEELA: Are you all right?\nDOCTOR: Rightly perfect, thank you yet, Lally.\nLEELA: What did you say?\nDOCTOR: I said, I'm perfectly all right, thank you, Lally.\nLEELA: My name is Leela.\nDOCTOR: Hmm? I know your name. Leela.\nLEELA: What happened?\nDOCTOR: Must have had a bot of a shik.\nLEELA: What?\nDOCTOR: A bot of a shik.\nLEELA: Doctor, what is it? What's the matter?\nDOCTOR: There's a voice or something in my head.\nLEELA: The evil thing.\nDOCTOR: Nonsense. Just a nasty turn. Come on, we're on Titan. Let's take a look.\nHe opens the doors and walks into one of them.\nDOCTOR: That was odd.\nLEELA: Doctor, don't go out.\nDOCTOR: What?\nLEELA: It's out there. Evil!\nLowe has returned to his quarters and grabs a blaster.\nDOCTOR: We must go. We've had a mayday.\nLEELA: No. I can feel it is wrong.\nDOCTOR: What, intuition?\nLEELA: I don't care what you call it, Doctor. I knew. I knew before that. Before you were affected.\nDOCTOR: What are you talking about, affected?\nLEELA: Well, before you were knocked out.\nDOCTOR: Leela, listen to me. I'm perfectly all right. Move over.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOut in the corridor Lowe comes up behind the crew outside the TARDIS.\nLOWE: Drop your weapons. I'm arresting you. All of you!\nThey turn to fire, but Lowe fires first and Silvey drops to the floor. Lowe dashes back down the corridor and goes in to a cryogenics room.\nSAFRAN: Close the door. Turn off the oxygen supply.\nThe Doctor opens the outer doors, peeks out and slams them again.\nA moment passes and slowly he opens the door again, looking down. Cautiously he exits, Leela behind.\nDOCTOR: Nobody around. Not a soul.\nHe blows a bird call.\nDOCTOR: Anyone home?\nLEELA: Doctor, look.\nThey kneel down by Silvey's body.\nDOCTOR: Disregard mayday. He said disregard mayday. Why?\nLEELA: It is still warm.\nDOCTOR: Don't be gruesome.\nLEELA: I am a hunter.\nDOCTOR: You're a savage.\nLEELA: Perhaps. I'm not ashamed of what I am and I tell you, Doctor, I can smell danger.\nDOCTOR: What did you say?\nLEELA: I said, I can smell danger.\nDOCTOR: Evil again?\nLEELA: Everywhere. In this place.\nDOCTOR: We'd better find it before it finds us.\nLEELA: Right.\nDOCTOR: Stay here.\nLEELA: I'm no coward.\nThey both go off in different directions, but the Doctor backs up again.\nDOCTOR: Now listen, whatever happens...\nHe turns to see Leela has gone, then he sets off again.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSAFRAN: Set temperature and humidity rate for optimum breeding conditions.\nMEEKER: Set temperature and humidity rate for optimum breeding conditions.\nThe Doctor comes upon them.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me, you don't know me. Let me introduce myself.\nSAFRAN: There is no need. We are preparing the hives now.\nDOCTOR: People call me the D. Hives?\nSAFRAN: For the nucleus which you carry within you.\nDOCTOR: Are you all right? I answered your mayday.\nThey turn to look at him.\nSAFRAN: You answered the call?\nDOCTOR: That's right, that's right. Has someone been hurt?\nSAFRAN: It is of no consequence. The physical envelope is of no importance.\nMEEKER: Of no importance.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean, of no importance?

The relief crew. They're insane. They've already killed these poor devils.\nLEELA: But why? Are they your enemies?\nLOWE: No. I know them. At least, I thought I did. But they've changed.\nLEELA: How changed?\nLOWE: Their eyes, their manner, their whole behaviour is different. One of them said something.\nLEELA: What?\nLOWE: Their purpose. This place will be suitable for our purpose. For our purpose, whatever that is.\nLEELA: The Doctor will know. He'll be here soon.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR (IN CORRIDOR): Leela? Leela, where are you?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLEELA: That's him. That's the Doctor.\nLOWE: No, wait. It could be a trap, if they've caught him.\nLEELA: What are we going to do?\nLOWE: Hide.\nDOCTOR (OOV.): Don't worry, Leela, it's only me. Listen to me, Leela. There's nothing wrong with this place. It's most suitable. It's a good place. A good place.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDOCTOR: Come on, Leela. I'm waiting. Please leave me. Please. I can't do it. I can't do it.\nMEEKER: Think of the purpose. She is a reject. She must die.\nDOCTOR: I can't.\nMEEKER: Think of the purpose!\nDOCTOR: I can't.\nMEEKER: The purpose is all important!\nInside the mess Lowe makes a noise.\nDOCTOR: The reject is here.\nMEEKER: Stay.

It's a locked cylinder. It needs a code.\nScottie: Which you don't know?\nDanny: No. I've gone over every conversation, every word.\nScottie: Danny, you've got to figure it out, you're the only one who can.\nScottie: Did you know that I suffer from depression?! Did you know that in the past I drank?!\nClaire: I didn't know Alex well personally. There are not many students who start their degree at 15.\nDanny: He was murdered.\nClaire: So I take it you want to speak to his professor?\nDanny: Marcus Shore.\nJournalist: Why did they murder him?\nDanny: I don't know.\nScottie: Whatever Alex discovered, whatever it was, whatever it is, no-one wants in the open. We're not up against one intelligence agency, we're up against them all.\nDanny: I need information.\nScottie: What does it mean? It means we are quite alone.\nRich: Get in the car. It's for you. Not here!\n( Mobile phone rings )\nDistorted voice: You're looking for answers. But are you ready for them? Get in the hotel. Room 116.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDistorted voice: The bathroom. Get in. Clothes on.\nDistorted voice: Now you're clean, we can talk a little freer. Get changed. Outside.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDanny: Where are we going?\nDistorted voice: Do you want to know who Alex was or not?\nDistorted voice: The doors are locked, Danny. No way out. No way back. I want to take you on a journey... into Alex's past.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDistorted voice: Remember this place? Are you sure you know what really happened in there? Walk.\n( Distant laughter )\nDistorted voice: A reservation. For two.\n( Phone beeps )\nWaitress: There you go. Menu.\nDoppelganger: Here I am. Alex's past.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDoppelganger: Well... this is weird. Never done anything like this before.\nDanny: Like this? What is this?\nDoppelganger: Being paid to tell someone how I... their boyfriend. They said you wouldn't believe me.\nDanny: Who are they?\nDoppelganger: Who are they? They are the people pulling my strings. I have no control over what I'm about to do. Like this... No control. Alex... ate breakfast here... almost every morning.\nDanny: You can even tell me what he liked to order?\nDoppelganger: What? Oh, to be convincing, you mean?\nDanny: You watched him?\nDoppelganger: Serving.\nDanny: A waiter?\nDoppelganger: Me? No. Please. I was pretending. The service... it's very expensive because the people, we... don't know that we are... escorts.\nDanny: How is that possible?\nDoppelganger: We pretend. We pretend to meet them by chance, we pretend to be won over by their charms... we pretend to... for pleasure... which takes some serious pretending.\nDanny: Who pays you?\nDoppelganger: Our clients aren't the people we... We report back. So and so... likes it like this. So and so... likes a little of this. ( He sniffs )\nDanny: Blackmail?\nDoppelganger: But that's not my business.\nDanny: You just do the f*cking.\nDoppelganger: I just do the f*cking.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n( Alex gasps )\nDoppelganger (O.C.): They told me to meet him... in the way you met him.\nDoppelganger: I'm sorry...\nDoppelganger (O.C.): An accident. They told me to be like you. They told me to act like you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDoppelganger: In the end, Alex wasn't so tricky. He just needed to believe... he was being good... all the way up until he was being... a little bit bad. How do you seduce a good man?\nDoppelganger (O.C.): My approach was simple. I told him a sad story.\nDoppelganger: I tell him it's the will and last testament of my mother. And my mother, she never loved me, bitch. In her will, the bitch leaves just three things to me. Just three paintings. That's all. And Alex, listening like a puppy dog. And I tell him, heartbroken... they are the three paintings I painted for her. I'm an artist, I say... No, not yet an artist, aspiring to be.\nDanny: Pretending to be.\nDoppelganger: That's a true story. I am an artist.\nDanny: What?\nDoppelganger: What do you think? I grew up wanting to be an escort? Enough, Danny. Enough with not believing. What do you need? I'll give it to you? Hmm? You need those little details? A birthmark on the inside of his thigh? Something whispered? Something moaned? He had a thirst, I can tell you that. Like a man crawling out of the desert. Yeah? Throat dry. Lips dry. Gulping up all those missed years.\nDanny: Where?\nDoppelganger: My place.\nDanny: Your place?\nDoppelganger: My fake place.\nDanny: Why did he come round?\nDoppelganger: To see my paintings, of course.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDanny: What did you do?\nDoppelganger (O.C.): You hate yourself for asking.\nDoppelganger: So...\nDoppelganger (O.C.): But you had to know.\nDoppelganger: I'll be right back, OK? Give me a second.\nDoppelganger (O.C.): You had to ask... what did we do?\nDoppelganger: We played a game. How long can we talk without mentioning the only thing we were both thinking about? The first game lasted an hour. The second game... lasted a little longer...\n( Alex pants )\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDoppelganger: I rang him afterwards, but he didn't answer. The client wanted more. But Alex wasn't interested.\nDanny: Why wouldn't you tell me that he kept coming back?\nDoppelganger: Because I can see you're good at sniffing a lie. So, I told you the truth.\nDanny: Why did they hire you?\nDoppelganger: I don't know, I don't care. It's just a job.\nDanny: He's dead. Your job. He was murdered. You think you're not involved? Because you seem like a loose end to me.\nDoppelganger: I was told to pay for our dinner.\nDanny: Hey? How else are you going to let them know what a great job you did?\nDoppelganger: I can see strings on you too.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDanny: What are you thinking?\nAlex: Say it again.\nDanny: What are you thinking?\nAlex: Nothing.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScottie: You were Alex's first experience of love. If he enjoyed a second, would you seem less important? Could the thrill of the new replace the comfort of the old? Watergate wasn't just about bugging the opposition. They used prostitutes to collect information on rival candidates to shame them, manipulate them, destroy them. s*x has always been a means of control. In the end, your relationship became a threat to their relationship with him. He changed you, you changed him, priorities altered, loyalties altered. I noticed it in our friendship. The two of you were besotted. The rest of the world ceased to exist, but Alex was one of their most important minds. Did you imagine they'd just allow him to drift away?\nDanny: I didn't think about it.\nScottie: It's all THEY would've thought about. What binds this brilliant young man to us? The Queen? Our history? His parents?\nDanny: I accept that I didn't know anything about his...work. His job. The truth is, I didn't really know him as a person either. I didn't know him.\nScottie: Of all the attacks they've used, including your health, the one that has proved most effective is smut. For you, of all people.\nDanny: He made a mistake, that's not it. But why didn't he tell me? Some of it? Any of it?\nScottie: Because you wanted him to be perfect. He saw that more clearly than you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDanny: It was his funeral last week. Do you know how I found out? I heard about it on the news. He was buried at a private ceremony for... close friends and family.\nScottie: I can't count how many men I've comforted when their partners were dying and the family wouldn't allow them into the hospital, or the church where they're buried. I'm tired of it... tired of hearing about it. He wasn't close to his parents, he was close to you. Hold your own funeral, say your own goodbye.\nDanny: That's what I should be doing. Saying goodbye.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDanny: What am I doing all this other stuff for? Because Alex discovered some government secret? So what? Cos they lied about a war? They spy on us? Who..? What's it got to do with me?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDanny: And you know, I don't know any code. I don't.\nDanny (O.C.): So, I don't know...\nDanny: Maybe, whatever those secrets are, maybe they weren't meant for me.\nScottie: Then, that's that.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n( Distant seagulls )\nDanny: Do you believe in soul mates?\nAlex: No. Not only do I not believe in them... it's not even a nice idea.\nDanny: Not a nice idea?\nAlex: That there's only just one other person out there for you. What are the odds this person would be in the same country? Or the same city? That their paths would even cross? It would mean almost everyone in the world is with the wrong person. If it's a way of saying, \"we're good together\", why not just say... \"we're good together\"? But if you mean it literally...\nDanny: You think there are better people out there for you?\nAlex: There might be. For both of us. But since we don't know them, it's just a theoretical.\nDanny: Yes. It's... a sentimental idea. The maths doesn't add up. But... we're by the fire, we're under a night sky. Couldn't you just have said \"yes\"?\nAlex: Is that what your soul mate would've done?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDanny: Can it be opened?\nSilversmith: If you know the code.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAlex: This is us.\nDanny: Oh, I've done a lot of things with a lot of different people and... that's part of the reason I'm sure... that we're something special. But, for you, it... I don't want you to stay with me just because I'm the first. So, you should see other people. You should.\nAlex: I don't want to.\nDanny: I only meant...\nAlex: I don't need to.\nAlex: .. that there's only just one other person out there for you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n( Dog barks )\n( Doorbell rings )\nDanny: Scottie? Scottie?! Scottie?\n( Faint murmuring )\nDanny: Scottie?! Scottie?\nScottie: I was just remembering.\nDanny: Huh?\nScottie: A place. I was remembering... a place.\nDanny: Right, we need to get you to the hospital.\nScottie: Will you just listen to me, for once, Danny?!\nDanny: You were remembering... a place.\nScottie: A place where no-one cares. Pathetic.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDanny: Thank you.\nScottie: My parents used to chide me. \"You were such a happy child.\"\nDanny: How long?\nScottie: Like this? Three weeks. Worse and worse each day. Now as bad as it's ever been. It can't be coincidence, can it? 30 years I've been OK and, now, like this?\nDanny: Why might someone who's managed depression for 30 years suddenly suffer a relapse? For no reason?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDanny: This is what we're going to do. We'll get new pills. Real pills from a different doctor. You can keep them on you at all... Unless they switch them before they give them to you. I'll get them illegally. I know someone. He can get anything.\nScottie: On your shell. Until they find a crack. A frailty. A vulnerability. No matter how small. And then they pick away.\nScottie: How do you kill an alcoholic? With alcohol. How do you kill a drug addict? With drugs. How do you kill a depressive?\nDanny: Where'd you get them?\nDealer: People tell the doctor whatever story, collect a prescription, sell it to me. They're good. It's all good. Always good from me. Do you want something else?\nDanny: No. Nothing else.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScottie: Thank you. Have you examined the contents?\nDanny: We're going to need help.\nScottie: With help comes risk. The more people you involve... Look what they've done to us. That was before they knew we had this.\nDanny: I can do this alone.\nScottie: There are rumours. About how the... Kremlin guarantees the loyalty of its most important citizens. Under the pretext of celebrating an election to the State Duma, the individual is treated to the finest meal Moscow has to offer. At some point during that night... this prized individual blacks out... waking in a hotel suite, on a bed, beside a terrified naked child. Before he can say anything, the FSB storm the room, arrest him, and take him to an interrogation cell in Moscow's Butyrka prison, where the individual swears he is not a paedophile. \"My drink must have been spiked!\" \"I, I've been framed by my enemies!\" He doesn't know. He can't explain. \"But it is a mistake!\" And, to his surprise... the FSB officer agrees that it is a mistake, but it is a mistake they will hold on record forever, a mistake no-one will ever see, unless... the individual makes a mistake of a political kind. And, with that, the man's choice is clear - privilege or disgrace. Destruction or survival. The FSB officer believes he's won. The individual believes he's lost. But those systems of oppression... as ruthless as they appear, as unbeatable as they seem, never hold, never last, never survive, for we will not live in fear. I would like to finish this particular adventure with you, Daniel Edward Holt. If you'll have me.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScottie (O.C.): We're being watched. We will be followed. So we separate. Shake them off. And meet up at a place... where no-one can follow us without revealing themselves.\nDanny: The place where no-one cares?\nScottie: I've always taken comfort from the idea that people don't care. That they have better things to think about, that there are more important matters to worry about. I like it when people walk past me and couldn't care less what I'm wearing, or whose hand I'm holding. The place where no-one cares. When I was young, I spent a lot of time searching for it, and I promised myself, if I ever found it, if it ever existed, that's where I'd make my home.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDanny: What do you think?\nScottie: Ambition. But no conviction. You skip from short stories to lyrics, from poems to sketches, hoping the world will tell you who you are. You must tell the world.\nClaire: There you are.\nScottie: Well done.\nDanny: You weren't followed?\nClaire: Well, I hope not.\nScottie: So, will Marcus help us?\nClaire: He didn't say. Keep back, and then that gives you your 'B' for 'Baritone'. Oh, I see - no, four, of course.\nScottie: Yes.\nClaire: And that's got...\nDanny: Where did you two meet?\nScottie: Cambridge.\nClaire: We shared a flat. I was the first person he shared the secret of his sexuality with.\nScottie: At that time, it was illegal. And there were rumours.\nClaire: So, then, I...agreed to play the part of...his lover. And we walked around arm in arm, and we... had picnics in the scholar's garden and... it was supposed to last about two months or so.\nScottie: It lasted two years.\nDanny: Are you gay?\nClaire: No.\nDanny: Did you see other people?\nClaire: No.\nScottie: I tried to become the man I was pretending to be. You know, I prayed for the right kind of desire? A sham romance, you might say.\nClaire: No.\nScottie: No, no. We're friends. We have been ever since. We can't be sad about that. I refuse to be sad about that.\nMarcus: It's all very touching.\nClaire: Marcus... This is Danny, Alex's partner. And Scottie.\nMarcus: Where is it?\nDanny: Cheers.\nMarcus: You didn't know, did you? How smart he was?\nDanny: I knew.\nMarcus: But not really.\nDanny: Not in the way you did, no.\nMarcus: His partner... without any appreciation of his intellect. Beyond some generalised idea that he was good with numbers. Love without knowledge. Popular culture might depict that as a romantic notion, I suppose.\nDanny: He never spoke about his work.\nMarcus: What did you talk about?\nDanny: Everything else.\nMarcus: I see. No, I don't. I don't see at all.\nDanny: Well, what did you two talk about? Outside of work?\nMarcus: We didn't. Look, try to understand, I was sure, absolutely certain that he was going to change the world in some way. Not my world. THE world. Can you imagine the enormity of that feeling? Being in the company of someone like that?\nDanny: We knew different people.\nMarcus: Hmm. The man I knew was exceptional. The man you knew was not.\nDanny: The...\nMarcus: Unless you're going to tell me how many sugars he took in his tea, or how he liked to be f*cked. Are these the details that define us?\nDanny: I think that... being admired is lonely.\nMarcus: You're right, I'm sure. But that was the price he had to pay. The ordinary world wasn't for him. And his flirtation with it... was always going to end badly.\nDanny: Professor? I miss him, too.\nMarcus: He did it. The 9/11 attackers sent e-mails using pre-arranged code words. \"The Faculty Of Urban Planning\" was the World Trade Center. The, uh, The Pentagon was \"The Faculty Of Fine Arts\". Mohammed Atta's final message to the other terrorists referred to their semesters beginning in three weeks at the faculties of Urban Planning and Fine Arts.\nTwo e-mails. In this one, \"zoo\" means zoo. In this one, it means airport. How do you tell them apart? When... people... who go to the zoo also visit... museums. They watch animated movies. Buy children's clothes. And donate... to animal charities. Convert our entire online history into numbers, and a visit to the zoo... looks... like this. A coded message looks... like this. The 9/11 terrorists used innocent words, but they didn't use them like the rest of us. We like to think of ourselves as individuals. But we're not. We're a pattern. We are... married, gay... straight, professional, rich, poor. Our online DNA, revealing... our true nature... even... when we lie. I told him he would change the world. I just didn't tell him how dangerous it would be. Alex decided to apply his concept to speech. Words don't occur in isolation. They're part of a series of actions. Your intake of breath, facial gestures, pupil dilation, hand movements. Alex theorised they formed patterns, and these patterns would be different if we were telling the truth or telling a lie.\nClaire: A lie detector?\nScottie: Important lies are told by important people.\nMarcus: They'd never consent to a test of any kind. Alex didn't need their consent. They've already provided all the information. The most important people in the world are also the most documented. Study every word they've ever spoken. Mundane, profound - it doesn't matter. Analyse every variable possible. Translate that information into numbers, and identify the patterns. A fingerprint... for our truths and our lies.\nClaire: We'd be able to analyse every statement.\nMarcus: Every political claim. Er, every case for war. Every court case verdict.\nScottie: The end of lies.\nMarcus: If the four of us survive a week, I'd be very surprised.\nMarcus: You're a thoroughly nice guy, aren't you, Danny? So was Alex. For all his intellect, an innocent, really. When he told me he was going to work for GCHQ, I knew it was a mistake. He didn't belong in that world. And I could feel him wanting me to tell him so.\nDanny: Why didn't you say something?\nMarcus: We didn't have that kind of a relationship. I take it you have some kind of plan?\nScottie: We must prove it works.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDanny: You don't have a plan, do you?\nScottie: No. He needed to believe I did. And we need him. You see? Proof - the orderly functioning of society depends on our ability to lie. Given the choice of no lies, or lies, every organization, every person of power, without exception, will choose lies.\nDanny: Maybe Alex imagined a better way of doing things.\nScottie: I wonder when he began work on this project.\nDanny: Why does that matter?\nScottie: Maybe he was ashamed of the lies he'd told you. Ashamed that your relationship was built on lies. Maybe on some level, he thought he was making amends.\nDanny: To who?\nScottie: To you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScottie: Danny!\nDanny: I'm to blame.\nScottie: I'm sorry.\nDanny: I'm to blame.\nScottie: I never said \"to blame\".\nDanny: He did it for me?\nScottie: It's possible.\nDanny: I never asked for it.\nScottie: He knew you'd find out that he'd lied about much of his life. He must have worried that you'd end up hating him. He must have worried about that moment every day. Would you still love him if you knew? Could you still love him if you knew? Would you re-examine your love story - Alex's only love story... and decide, in the end, it was nothing but a lie?\nDanny: He was never sure.\nScottie: How could he be?\nDanny: I wish I could've told him. That none of it mattered. The lies, the mistakes. That I loved him, just the same. That I, I love him. Still. Now. Knowing it all. I wish he could've heard me say it.\nScottie: Yes.\nDanny: He'll never know.\nScottie: No.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDanny: This is going to sound a, a bit... But...it occurred to me I'd never said it out loud before. I love you. Very much.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDetective Taylor: You're not going to be charged.\nDanny: Is that it?\nDetective Taylor: You're free to go.\nDanny: You brought me here like this to tell me that? Will anyone be charged?\nDetective Taylor: Danny... for you... this is over.\nDanny: This isn't over. This isn't over.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n( Applause )\n( Phone rings )\nDanny: Scottie?\nScottie: Danny.

        "logit_0": "  The text is a conversation between two characters, Danny and Scottie, in which they discuss the relationship between Danny and his friend Alex. Alex was a brilliant mathematician who worked for the government intelligence agency GCHQ. He was also a secretive person who kept many secrets from Danny. One day, Alex told Danny that he was going to work for GCHQ, and Danny was shocked. He felt that Alex was not suited for the job and that he was lying to him. Danny and Alex had a close relationship, but it was built on lies. Alex felt ashamed of the lies he had told Danny and wanted to make amends. He decided to create a project that would prove that lying was necessary for the functioning of society. The project was successful, but Alex was killed in the process. Danny was devastated by Alex's death and blamed himself for not being able to save him. He also felt guilty for not being able to tell Alex how much he loved him. In the end, Danny was not charged with any crimes and was allowed to go free. However, he was left with a sense of guilt and regret.</s>package com.example.android.miwok;"

Fake psycho Derek... whatever the hell his name is... he's locked up. You know that.\nPEYTON : Yeah, that's what they said last time... or what he said. I don't know. Maybe if I just see it with my own eyes that he's actually behind bars...\nBROOKE : Maybe. Come on.\n(They start walking and Peyton has a vision of Derek again)\nPEYTON : Hey... You know what, I'm gonna have to catch up with you, okay?\nBROOKE : Okay.\nINSIDE PRISON\nPeyton comes to see Derek in his cell\nDEREK : Hi, baby. I knew you'd come. Well, they said that you wouldn't, but... I knew that you would.\nPEYTON : I want to know why. Why me? Why did you pick me?\nDEREK : You love me.\nPEYTON : No. I don't. I hate you. Don't you get that? You're just a deranged, pathetic psycho, and I never, ever want to see you again, okay?\nDEREK : Then why'd you come? Have I been in your head? You asked me to come into your life, Peyton. You got undressed in front of your webcam because you knew it would make me want you. You posted those pictures online.\nPEYTON : You are wrong.\nDEREK : Am I? Is that why you're dressed like that today? Are you a tease, Peyton? Dressing sexy... wearing that perfume, making me... ache for you, and then saying no?\nPEYTON : Stop.\nDEREK : Are you a tease, Peyton? Because that would really be disappointing.\nPEYTON : I did not do this. You did this.\n(She leaves)\nDEREK : No, you did this! You did this to me, Peyton! It's all your fault! You did this to me! You did this! Tease!\nDAN'S HOUSE\nDan is looking at his gun and hides it when Nathan walks in\nNATHAN : Thought you'd look a lot worse, considering the walls are closing in.\nDAN : What do you mean?\nNATHAN : The point-shaving, dad.\nDAN : Right. What are you hearing?\nNATHAN : Nothing. You think it's Bear?\nDAN : No, no. If it was Bear, he'd have pointed them right to us. Sounds like the whispers of someone who lost a lot of money but isn't close enough to know the details.\nNATHAN : They're asking questions about Lucas now, and it's not right. He only missed those free throws because of me.\nDAN : Okay. But that's the only time I ever want to hear you say that out loud. Look, first, you won the state championship and every postseason game that Lucas played in, so they're grasping at straws.\nNATHAN : You don't think it's serious?\nDAN : No, it's serious... because if they find proof, your future's in jeopardy. But I don't think they're gonna find any proof.\nNATHAN : So, what do I do?\nDAN : You stay cool. Deny everything. And pray no one uncovers the truth.\nABBY BROWN'S HOUSE\nLucas is watching from his car. When the mother leaves, he goes inside the house and find Abby\nLUCAS : I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to scare you. I didn't mean to scare you. My name's Lucas Scott. We... We go to school together at Tree Hill. Do you know me?\n(Abby shakes her head)\nLUCAS : My uncle was Keith Scott, and I know that you were in the tutor center that day, and I know that Jimmy let you go. So... Listen... I have to know what you saw, Abby. Okay? You got to tell me. Did Jimmy Edwards... kill Keith?\n(Abby shakes her head)\n(Then her mother enters the room)\nABBY'S MOM : What is this? What the hell is this?\nLUCAS : Look, Mrs. Brown, I can exp...\nABBY'S MOM : Get out. Get the hell out of my house, or I'll call the police!\nLUCAS : And tell them what, huh? That your daughter knows the truth about my uncle's death?\nABBY'S MOM : Your uncle was Keith Scott? I'm very sorry for you, but my daughter has been traumatized since then. She hasn't been to school. Her life has become very difficult, and that is why I lied to you last night.\nLUCAS : Listen, Abby told me that Jimmy Edwards didn't kill my uncle Keith.\nABBY'S MOM : Did she? Honey, is your name Abby?\n(Abby shakes her head)\nABBY'S MOM : Am I your mother?\n(Abby shakes her head)\nABBY'S MOM : Are you sure?\n(Abby shakes her head again)\nABBY'S MOM : Now, I'm very sorry for your loss. That day changed all of us... and none of us for the better. But I'd like you to leave. And Lucas, don't come back. Abby has been through enough.\nINSIDE LUCAS'S BEDROOM\nHaley is waiting, Lucas enters\nLUCAS : Hey.\nHALEY : Hey.\nLUCAS : Jeez, you look worse than I do.\nHALEY : Yeah. Um, listen, uh, the thing is that, uh... Nathan said this whole gambling thing's just gonna go away, and I don't real know, uh, how much I believe that, and I just wanted to know what you thought ... if you think that he's right or... or do you think he's right?\nLUCAS : No. It's not going away.\nHALEY : 'Cause he said that they're just focusing on you, and then they're not gonna find anything, and nothing's gonna happen.\nLUCAS : Yeah, but, see, that's the problem. You know, yeah, I mean, I missed a couple free throws, but I'm a sub. I played half a season, 15 minutes a night. No gambler's gonna build a point-shaving scheme around a reserve.\nHALEY : Okay, so, what is gonna happen, then?\nLUCAS : Well, I think that after they're done looking at me, that they're gonna start taking a look at Nathan. I hate to say it, Hales, but when they do... it's gonna end up really bad.\nHALEY : Okay. Okay, um... How bad is... is really bad?\nLUCAS : Well, Nathan's not gonna go to jail. But he's not gonna go to Duke, either.\nTHE APARTMENT\nPeyton is sleeping but she is awake by Derek's voice\nDEREK (voiceover): It's all your fault!\n(She turns her head and sees a vision of Derek right beside her)\nDEREK : Tease.\n(Brooke enters the room)\nBROOKE : Peyton? Hey, what's wrong?\nPEYTON : I went to see him.\nBROOKE : Who? Oh, no. Derek?\nPEYTON : Ian. His name is Ian.\nBROOKE : I know.\nPEYTON : You do?\n(Brooke take a field from a drawer)\nBROOKE : Been hiding these from you. There's been a lot of articles about the attack.\nPEYTON : I thought you were clipping coupons.\nBROOKE : I know, honey, but I hate coupons.\n(They ear the front door opening)\nPEYTON : Did you leave the front door unlocked?\nBROOKE : No.\n(They look scared and Haley enters the room)\nHALEY : I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have a key. I... I didn't know if you were sleeping. Sorry.\nBROOKE : It's okay. You locked the door, right?\nHALEY : Yes, I did.\nPEYTON : I used to love my room, and he took it from me. Psycho Derek. It's like I... I really thought if we just fought back, like, if we attacked our attacker, that he would go away, but he hasn't.\nHALEY : It's really gonna take some time, Peyton. You guys went through something really traumatic.\nPEYTON : Yeah, but what if you have finals and you can't sleep and you don't have time?\nBROOKE : Well, then, hopefully, you have a friend who's gonna tell you that life kicks you around sometimes. It... It scares you, and it beats you up. But... there's a day when you realize that you're not just a survivor. You're a warrior. You're tougher than anything it throws your way. And you are, Peyton. You are. And so are you, Hales.\nHALEY : Thank you. And so are you, Brooke.\nBROOKE : Thanks.\nBROOKE (to Peyton) : Come here.\nOUTSIDE WHITEY'S HOUSE\nLucas knocks at the door\nWHITEY : I was hoping for a booty call.\nLUCAS : Sorry, coach.\nWHITEY : What's so important it can't wait till a decent hour?\nLUCAS : It's the investigation. It was me. I missed those free throws in the semifinals on purpose, and I just wanted you to hear it from me before I hold a press conference tomorrow. I'm sorry, coach.\nWHITEY : You know, I only took a chance on you because Keith asked me to.\nLUCAS : I know.\nWHITEY : He would be ashamed of you right now... just like I am.\n(Whitey shuts the door)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRIVERCOURT\nNathan is playing alone when Whitey arrives\nWHITEY : Keeping in shape?\nNATHAN : Yes, sir.\nWHITEY : Duke's gonna be pretty rough, especially if you're not in shape.\nNATHAN : Yes, sir.\nWHITEY : So, there's, uh... some reporters asking questions about, uh... gambling... point-shaving... that kind of thing. You know anything about that?\nNATHAN : No, sir.\nWHITEY : Well, your brother's name's not going to be worth a damn when this whole thing comes down.\nNATHAN : What do you mean? Lucas didn't do anything wrong.\nWHITEY : Not what he says.\nNATHAN : What?\nINSIDE LUCAS' HOUSE\nLucas is watching a picture of Keith when Nathan enters the house\nNATHAN : What the hell is wrong with you?\nLUCAS : You're welcome.\nNATHAN : Screw that, Luke. We said we weren't gonna say anything. We agreed.\nLUCAS : So what?\nNATHAN : So what did you do?\nLUCAS : I went and saved your stupid ass so you could play college basketball and have everything you've ever dreamed about.\nNATHAN : You know what? That's a bunch of crap. We could have beat this thing, man.\nLUCAS : Sounds like you're feeling a little guilty to me.\nNATHAN : Yeah, of course I'm feeling guilty, but you shouldn't have said anything to Whitey, man. That was a stupid thing to do.\nLUCAS : You know what? I don't care. I'm not going to college to play basketball anyway. It doesn't matter.\nNATHAN : It doesn't matter that for the rest of time, people are gonna talk? They're gonna say you disgraced the game, Luke. That doesn't matter to you?\nLUCAS : Let them say what they want to say about me. It's what they say about Jimmy Edwards. That matters to me. And what they say about Keith. But this? At least I know the truth about this.\nNATHAN : Peyton thinks I'm a martyr. I can't stop this, Luke. I just... I'm this close, man, and I got the baby. I can't. You shouldn't have said anything.\nTHE APARTMENT\nBrooke opens the curtains to awake Peyton\nPEYTON : What's going on?\nBROOKE : It's a new day. Move your scrawny butt. I checked the shower, and psycho Ian's not in there, so you need to be, because, no offense, you're kind of rank.\nPEYTON : Thanks a lot.\nBROOKE : Well, I just call them likeI smell them. Choppity-Choppity.\nPEYTON : What are you doing?\nBROOKE : I told you. We're warriors. We kicked that idiot's psychotic ass, so a new day dawns, P. Sawyer.\nPEYTON : Yeah, but when I went to go see him... Brooke, he said I led him on... that I led him on with, like, my podcasts and my webcam and the way that I dress.\nBROOKE : Peyton. So you're saying that every girl who wears a little bit of lipstick and a short skirt is asking to be assaulted and raped?\nPEYTON : No, of course not, but... I did give him full access to my life, and now he knows all this stuff about me. And he uses it, you know? He uses it to get in.\nBROOKE : Okay. Then it's time we start learning a little bit about him. Get up and fight, warrior. And take a shower.\nGUN ROOM\nCLERK : Just the ammo today, sir?\nDAN : Yeah, just the ammo.\nCLERK : The only reason I ask is, we just got this baby in today. .45 automatic, and if you've got your handgun permit, you can be shooting her today.\n(Dan hold the gun and start aiming, then a little girl sees him, she get scared and drops the doll she was holding)\nCLERK : How'd that feel?\nTHE APARTMENT\nBrooke and Peyton are looking on the computer\nBROOKE : Jeez. Who knew there were so many Ian Banks?\nPEYTON : Maybe we should add \"stalker\" to the search.\nBROOKE : Really.\nPEYTON : So, where's your head at with Chase these days?\nBROOKE : I don't know. I think about him a lot. You know how it is. Start wondering if he ever thinks about me, and if he does, is it the same? Did he leave 'cause of the videotape, or was he just looking for an out? You know... same old self-doubt. Oh, wow. This is him. He's not from St. Flora. He's from Texas.\nPEYTON : What?\nBROOKE : Oh, my god. His girlfriend looks just like you, if you...\nPEYTON : If I what?\nBROOKE : If you were dead.\nABBY BROWN'S HOUSE\nAbby comes to see her mom\nABBY : I want to tell someone, mom.\nABBY'S MOM : Abby.\nABBY : I'm tired of lying about what I saw, and I'm tired of hiding out and pretending I'm crazy. I want to go back to school, mom.\nABBY'S MOM : Honey, you can't. As soon as I make enough money, we'll go someplace different. We will, but for now, we have to do it this way.\nABBY : Why?\nABBY'S MOM : Because I say so. That's why.\nABBY : So what, then? We just hide from our lives?\nABBY'S MOM : At least we have lives.\nABBY : Not really, mom. And you might be afraid of this, but I'm not.\nABBY'S MOM : Abby. Abby. Abby!\n(Abby starts leaving and opens the front door. Dan is there)\nABBY'S MOM : You need to get out of here.\nDAN : I want to talk to you.\nABBY'S MOM : I said get out!\nDAN : Calm down! Just shut up! Will you shut up?! Just... Okay, look. I need you to sit down. Just... Just go sit down.\n(They go to the couch)\nDAN : Sit down. You're Abby Brown. Look, I don't know what you think you might have seen.\nABBY'S MOM :She didn't see anything.\nDAN : Shut up! Just... You made a mistake.\nABBY : No. I saw you. I saw everything. ABBY'S MOM :Abby. She's not well.\nABBY : I know what you did. And so do you.\nDAN : My brother Keith was always better than me. He had a better heart. People liked him more. No, they loved him. Karen loved him. But... Karen was mine. She was supposed to be mine. ABBY'S MOM :She was just a girl who went to school that day. She's just a girl.\nABBY : I hope you burn in hell.\nDAN : So do I.\n(Dan put the little girl's doll on the table and leaves)\nINSIDE PRISON\nPeyton and Brooke come visiting Derek/Ian\nIAN : Well, if it isn't tease one and tease two. Did you come back for another kiss?\nBROOKE : Not really, Derek. Or should I call you \"Ian\"? Yeah, we know your real name. Actually, we know a lot of things about you. We spoke to all your teachers at the Alton Academy and the girls you used to date.\nIAN : You don't know anything about me.\nPEYTON : Really? Susanna Gold ring a bell? You know, a lot of teenage boys have performance anxiety.\nIAN : I know a lot of teenage girls who are teases, too.\nBROOKE : Is that really the best that you've got? 'Cause we have a lot more than some podcasts and a few webcam photos, Ian Banks.\nIAN : Whatever.\nBROOKE : Boyfriend of Maggie Watterson. Or should I say former boyfriend?\nIAN : You shut your mouth, you whore.\nPEYTON : Hey, what happened to Maggie, Ian?\nIAN : I don't know what you're talking about.\nBROOKE : Really? 'Cause the accident... you were driving. It was prom night.\nIAN : No, it wasn't my fault!\nPEYTON : What happened, Ian? Ian?\nIAN : We were just messing around... driving fast. My father never let me drive that car. He loved that car.\nPEYTON : The road was slippery. You lost control.\nIAN : I tried to wake her up. There was just... blood. There was just so much blood. Her parents said it was my fault. They... They all said it.\nPEYTON : I can't be Maggie, Ian. I'm not Maggie.\nIAN : We were gonna be together forever. She loved me. She... She trusted me.\nBROOKE : She forgives you.\nPEYTON : She forgives you... I forgive you, too.\nIAN : I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\n(Ian starts crying)\nPEYTON : I'm not gonna be seeing you anymore. You're not gonna see us, either... ever. Ever. Goodbye, Ian. I hope you find peace.\nSCOTT'S HOUSE\nHaley and Nathan are in bed.\nNATHAN : We talked about not saying anything. Lucas... he was supposed to do nothing.\nHALEY : He's really just trying to help out.\nNATHAN : It's just so Lucas, you know? Trying to be the hero. I'm not gonna feel guilty about it. Nobody asked him to do this.\nHALEY : That's not exactly true. He's doing this for me because I asked him to. And if you're not gonna feel guilty about it, then I sure as hell will, because he is my best friend and he's your brother and he's doing this for all of us. For you and me and our son, and, um... it just really sucks.\nNATHAN : Damn it. I'm sorry, Hales. I'm sorry I put us through this. I'm sorry I made you ask Lucas to take the blame. I'm sorry I've been so weak about all this.\nHALEY : You are about to make every dream you've had come true. Everybody understands that.\nNATHAN : No, it's not worth it. I mean, what the hell was I thinking? We're gonna be parents soon. What would we want our son to do? What would make us proud? And what am I gonna say to him someday when he asks about this? That I was Dan? That I put what I wanted in front of everything else?\nHALEY : Nathan... you're gonna lose it all... your scholarship, the game that you love.\nNATHAN : I won't lose it all. I'll still have you, and we'll still have our son... and we'll have that feeling that in the face of all this, we didn't lose our way. We still know right from wrong.\nHALEY : I'm just... scared for you. I love you for this, but... but it's just not... it's not my dream that's dying. It's yours.\nNATHAN : It's gonna be hard. I know that, but... the people I admire are the people that carve a life for themselves after their dream dies. My father could never get past it, Hales. He could never let go of what he wanted when he was 17... and look what it did to him.\nLUCAS' BEDROOM\nLucas is dreaming of him a the rivercourt, seeing Abby\nABBY (voiceover) : Open your eyes, Lucas. Open your eyes.\n(He wakes up and Abby is there, in his room)\nLUCAS : Abby?\nABBY : I need to talk to you. I know what my mom said, and I'm sorry she lied, but I need to tell\nyou some things.\nLUCAS : You were hiding in the hallway.\n(We start seeing some flashbacks from the shooting episode)\nABBY : I got scared, and I ran, but I was worried about the others and Jimmy, too. I saw it in his eyes when he let me go. He was just scared, too.\nLUCAS : You came back. And what happened after that? Huh? Abby? Come on, you got to tell me.\nPlease.\nABBY : Your uncle Keith... he tried to help Jimmy.\n(KEITH : Please. )\nABBY : But he couldn't. And Jimmy...\nLUCAS : Jimmy what? Jimmy what?\n(KEITH : No!)\nLUCAS : Was my uncle Keith still alive when Jimmy shot himself?\n(Abby nods)\nLUCAS : Who shot him, Abby?\nABBY : I thought once he realized someone knew the truth, he'd come forward, so I stalked him with messages and threats. I thought he'd turn himself in. I thought I'd be safe. But he found me.\nLUCAS : Who?! Who killed... Who killed my uncle?\nABBY : Your father. It was your father... Dan Scott. He killed Keith. He was there... and he picked up the gun... and you know I'm right, don't you? You know it in your heart.\nLUCAS : You have to come forward. You got to tell somebody, Abby.\n(She starts leaving)\nLUCAS : Abby, you have to tell somebody!\nABBY : I did. I told you. I'm sorry.\n(She leaves)\nTREE HILL HIGH\nThe reporters are there for the press conference. Nathan comes to see Whitey, in private\nNATHAN : Coach.\nWHITEY : I don't know how you can look your brother in the eye, Nathan. This is a damn disgrace.\nNATHAN : Coach, I lied to you on the River Court yesterday and during the playoffs. It wasn't Lucas.\nWHITEY : I know.\nNATHAN : I'm sorry.\nWHITEY : So am I... more than you'll ever know.\n(Whitey leaves)\nHaley joins Nathan, they walk together outside to the press conference. Lucas is in the audience\nNATHAN : When I was 2 years old, I made my first basket. When I was 6, basketball went from being a game to a sport. Since then, I've played 7,072 official minutes... probably 20,000 or 30,000 unofficial. But for 32 minutes this season, over the course of two games, I did not compete to the best of my ability. I regret this. And I regret that the fear of losing the opportunity to continue playing the game that I've always loved prevented me from standing up and taking full responsibility for this sooner. I apologize to my coach and to my teammates and to all the kids who look up to me... especially to the kids. And while I never lost a game on purpose, the truth is still the truth. And you can spin it and shade it and bend it, but there's still right and wrong, and I was wrong. And the truth is, I've forsaken a game that's always been incredibly good to me and teammates that have been like brothers... and a brother that was a teammate. To my coach... my wife... my father, and my family, I apologize for the burden I know this will bring. I know that the integrity of the game cannot be compromised. I regret that my own integrity was not as steadfast. I'm deeply remorseful for the choices I've made, but I will accept whatever consequences there might be. I love this game. I'm sorry I betrayed it.\nTHE APARTMENT\nPeyton enters the room. The walls are paint in red and there are Peyton's music albums on the shelves.\nPEYTON : Brooke...\nBROOKE : You loved your room, Peyton. And, maybe, like you said, that's been taken from you, but we're gonna take it back. We're gonna take everything back.\nLUCAS' HOUSE\nDan enters Lucas' empty bedroom. Then Karen sees him.\nKAREN : Dan?\nDAN : I've done some horrible things. Unforgivable things. Lucas didn't need a father. He had one. He had a person who helped him erase the shame of my cowardice. Everything I've touched, I've diminished... Deb's life, Nathan's talent. Keith.\nKAREN : You're... you're not without redemption. I've... I've seen it. I see it.\nDAN : That's not true. That's not true. I just want to... I want to go back, you know? I just want to go back. I... I want to take that little kid that I used to be and just grab him and shake him and say, \"You stop. Stop! Just stop!\" I want to wake up from this nightmare. I... I want to breathe again. I want to... I want to breathe again, Karen. Can you help me breathe? Can you help me quiet these voices in my head that tell me I've lost you? Because I know that I have. If only I would have stayed with you. Lucas comes home and find Karen and Dan kissing.\nLUCAS (voiceover) : Truth is still absolute. Believe that... even when that truth s hard and cold and more painful than you've ever imagined. And even when truth... is more cruel than any lie.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Went pretty badly, as I understand it, in the confines of a motor coach belonging to Wynn Duffy.\nBoyd: Baby?\n[grunts]\nWhat disappoints you, Raylan Givens? The fact that you weren't the one who got to shoot me? Where is she goin'?\nBoyd: Well, you wheel me outta here, I'll take you straight to her. [chuckles] That's funny.\nBoyd: Sooner or later, one way or the other, I'm gonna get out of here, and when I do, I'm gonna go get that money.\nZachariah: Now, this Grubes guy we're going to see ... you sure he knows his way around?\nAva: He knows the trails blindfolded. Boyd knows Grubes.\nZachariah: Ah.\nAva: If he's alive ...\nZachariah: If he's alive, the marshals got him, and if he ain't, the more, the better. Grubes?\n[yelling] Ava: Nooo!\nCarl: How we gonna get you out past the nurses' stand without anybody noticing?\nBoyd: [sighs] It shouldn't be too hard with all the chaos.\nCarl: What chaos?\n[gunshot]\nArt: You got 48 hours, Raylan.\nRaylan: 48 hours, bullshit.\nWho you got coming after me? Everybody?\nArt: Everybody's out looking for Boyd.\nI'll be the one coming after you.\n[car door chiming]\n[chiming stops]\nBoyd: Evening, sir. Where you headed tonight?\nHagan: Headed home.\nBoyd: You got any kin waiting on you?\nHagan: No, sir, I don't.\nBoyd: That won't be necessary.\nHagan: Well...

Slurry pond fouled the spring. No water on the other side of the mountain. No water ... nothing to hunt. Well, I reckon it was hard to move on.\nCope: Was. They'll take the mountaintop year's end, I heard. I'd have had to move on regardless. Wouldn't mind if you sat a spell.\nRaylan: I got urgent matters. My advice ... keep moving on. There's a fugitive at large hereabouts. Give my best to Cousin Mary if you see her.\nCope: Unh-unh. She passed.\nRaylan: Condolences. Stand up. Tell 'em to come out, guns pointed at the ground.\nCope: [whistles]\nRaylan: [sighs] If that ain't all of 'em, you're the first one who gets shot.\nCope: That's all of 'em.\nRaylan: Lay your guns down. Every second I spend on your bullshit, the man I'm hunting gets further away. Now, tell 'em to do it before I lose my temper. Now, walk down that hill, and keep walking ... about an hour. He'll catch up with you soon if he don't do something stupid.\nAva: No sign.\n[panting]\n[clinking]\nI bet they ran off after Grubes died. And I bet they starved to death.\nZachariah: We got no guide, and you're worried about the horses?\nAva: That's one bad omen on top of another.\nZachariah: I ain't superstitious.\nAva: Well, it doesn't take a damn ouija board to see that our plan is as dead as the man that used to live in that house.\nYou'd notice if you weren't playing in the dirt!\nZachariah: I'm digging a grave.\nAva: For us? Huh?\nUncle Zachariah, we gotta get out of here. Oh, is that the way it is? Leave the dead to bury their own? That's something you learned from Boyd, huh?\nAva: You don't know me. You ... You want to be all high and mighty? Let's see how that saves your ass.\nZachariah: I know you don't want to hear me preach, but I'm gonna tell you right now, there's six months' worth of food in that cabin, plenty of water, and a lot of firewood for the cold. Wait a minute. If that's your idea of a plan... Oh no, little girl. I like your idea... we just roam around these goddamn mountains not knowing what the hell we're doing, lost, hauling 300, 400, 500 pounds of money? Oh, you're real smart, girl.\nAva: I can't keep this up.\nZachariah: Yes, you can, and you will. 'Cause that's who we are, born in these godforsaken hollers in this goddamn broken-down world. We're survivors.\nAva: Okay, you want to stay? We can stay. But we're gonna fight.\nZachariah: Won't have to fight. After two weeks, they'll think we're somewhere over in Virginia. They'll just move that search on over there.\nAva: I'm talking about Boyd. He knows this place. He will come.\nZachariah: Boyd is dead. And if he ain't dead, he's in jail. We'll be safe here for a while. Grab that shovel and help me get this man in the ground.\nCope: I don't see any badge.\nAre you still a federal? This guy you're chasing... he personal business?\nRaylan: You met him. You put me in a box with him. He's now a federal fugitive.\nCope: So you should've let me kill him at the time, then, huh?\nRaylan: Thought has crossed my mind.\nCope: So I'm right. Gotta be you, the one that does him. Had a coyote like that. Ate near 10 of my chickens... one every night. Dogs couldn't catch her, avoided the traps like she'd set 'em herself. You know, what I decided to do was ...\nRaylan: I don't care what you did. I need you to shut your mouth and get up that hill.\nCope: You know, after we tangled, Cousin Mary told us all about you. Turns out, I remember your daddy. He's a son of a bitch.\nRaylan: You'll get no argument there.\nCope: You know what he did?\nRaylan: Historically or on a specific day?\nCope: He used us. Used our blood ties to your Mama to have us move his drugs up and down our mountain ... the way you're moving me right now. The way I see it, that makes you a son of a bitch, too.\nRaylan: Guilty as char...\nCope: [grunts]\nRaylan: I let you go, you gonna get your people, come back after me?\nCope: Got any good reason why I shouldn't?\nRaylan: With what purpose in mind?\nCope: You saw 'em. They got nothing. They'll kill you for your boots.\nRaylan: Give me that. In a couple days, you're gonna come to Arlo Givens' place, he's in the book. I'm signing it over to you.\nCope: Y-You're giving me your house?\nRaylan: He did you people dirt. This is payback.\nBeen using that place as a bullshit excuse.\nI don't need the money from selling it. I need to find Boyd and get to Florida.\nCope: [grunts] What's this?\nRaylan: A note... bequeathing the property to you... ...case I don't make it down.\n[music]\n[title music]\n♪ On this lonely road, trying to make it home ♪ ♪ doing it by my lonesome, pissed off, who wants some? ♪ ♪ I'm fighting for my soul, god, get at your boy ♪ ♪ you try to bogard, fall back, I go hard ♪ ♪ on this lonely road, trying to make it home ♪ ♪ doing it by my lonesome, pissed off, who wants some? ♪ ♪ I see them long, hard times to come ♪\nMarkham: I always scoffed at people talking to... loved ones who'd moved on. Seemed impractical to me. Can't hear you. They're gone. And I'm a practical man. Except when it comes to you, it seems. Revenge, Katherine. What did you in? Damn it, I told you I would get Duffy! Why didn't you trust me? For once, why couldn't you just do what you were told to do? I'll always love you, Katherine, but you need to know. I may be talking to a ghost, but I am still a practical man. I'd love to gut Wynn Duffy from nose to tail, but I have got to go and get my goddamn money. Wynn Duffy. Hey, you've got a damn good lawyer, Wynn, And I ought to know, because I'm a damn good lawyer.\nWynn: I'll pass along the adulation. Are these the personal items from my motor coach?\nVasquez: Yeah, I had to call in a lot of favors to get you transferred to federal custody. And now ... well, it seems now I got to let you go. Billie Jean King.\nWynn: A pioneer.\nVasquez: We took the liberty to freeze your bank accounts...\nWynn: It's prescription. I have... sensitive gums.\nVasquez: ...pending the results of the investigation. You're fully cleared, [i]should be able to get most of your assets off ice. Oh, look at this. You are an eagle scout.\nWynn: It belonged to a dear friend.\nVasquez: Mm. 'Course, KSP's gonna want to keep your winnebago a bit longer, but if you want that, you can stick around for another week or two.\nWynn: That they can have.\nVasquez: Bad memories?\nWynn: Raylan Givens, Boyd Crowder, and Avery Markham are soon to converge, Mr. Vasquez. Like the aligning of the planets if those planets carried guns and hated my guts. I don't ever plan on returning to Kentucky. May I?\nVasquez: I just have one last question.\nYou know, for me. Off the record.\nWynn: Sounds sexy.\nVasquez: You know, I have a-a stack of files this tall. Sits on my desk. It's got all kinds of witness interrogation and, um, surveillance records and info from snitches about who killed Simon Poole 14 years ago. And it all adds up to... jack sh1t. So I just want to know, between you and me, who really did it? Who killed my boss?\nWynn: Between you and me, Mr. Vasquez, I really and truly don't know.\nWoman: Air unit East to Evarts.\nPossible fugitive sighting. Please confirm. Over.\nMan: Copy. Which fugitive? Over.\nWoman: Uh, Boyd Crowder ... possibly in police uniform. Considered armed. Stolen police vehicle recovered. Possible hostage situation.\nZachariah: God damn.\n[Ava chuckles nervously]\nOh, god... Of course. Of course!\n[laughing]\nZachariah: What the hell you laughing about?\nAva: It's a joke. Don't you get it? We're dead!\nZachariah: No, we got to do something.\nAva: We're gonna run. Hell yeah! Let's run!\nYou know your way around this goddamn mountain, little girl? 'Cause I sure as hell don't.\nAva: Forget about the mountain. We got to go back down! We got to ... we got to ... I don't know ... find one of them abandoned houses and ... and hide out.\nZachariah: Federals kicking in every goddamn door, dogs running around, sniffing around, they'd find us in no time.\nAva: You got a better idea? Else we're dead.\nZachariah: Yeah, I got an idea. We're gonna sit right here, we're gonna wait. And when he shows up, we're gonna kill him. The end.\nAva: That's not gonna be our end. 'Cause staying here is suicide.\nBoyd: I'm gonna need you for a little while longer. I'd rather take your time than take your truck.\nHagan: You can have her.\nBoyd: Yeah, well, I don't want her. I'm just looking to get from point \"A\" to point \"B.\" Look, Mr. Crowder, I done helped you out. I gave you my son's clothes.\nBoyd: You know my name. You know what I done. God damn right I know your name. And which time you talking about? Well, I do have a rather long résumé.\nHagan: Yes, sir. They put out your greatest hits, it'd be a double album.\nBoyd: sh1t. Double live, man, from Japan.\nHagan: Hell yeah. All killer, no filler.\nBoyd: [laughs]\nHagan: Konnichiwa, bitches. sh1t.\nYou nearest thing we got to Billy the Kid around here.\nBoyd: Well, I don't know about all that.\nHagan: sh1t, son, you're smart. Articulate, strong. The way you look, the way you talk, ain't nobody expect nothing from you. Then you unleash, and they cannot deny. [clicks tongue] It ain't too much to call you a hero. Well, if you insist.\nHagan: Go on. Be proud to give the outlaw Boyd Crowder my truck.\n[keys jingle]\nBoyd: Thing is, they're looking for me. They ain't looking for you.\nSo I'm gonna need you to drive.\nDerrick: Man, this sucks.\nLoretta: I ain't paying you to whine.\nDerrick: Yeah? And I didn't come for the money. Well [chuckles]... not just the money.\nLoretta: Look, I got people maybe out to kill me, Derrick. You came just to get back together, you're a damn fool.\nDerrick: Loretta... [clank] ...why you got to be talking ...\n[man groans]\nGot him.\nLoretta: Hold up. I can't see.\nDerrick: Here, let me look. [door opens]\nBoon: Hey, Loretta. I been looking everywhere for you.\nYou know, one way in and out of this place ...\nI snap one of your traps, and you both take your eyes off the door? You're a smart girl, but I got a thing or two to teach you yet. I reckon I could see you both better if you stepped out this way.\nYes, you, son. Come on, now. Giddyup.\n[clicks tongue]\nNow, how about you put down them toys? I'm not here to start a ruckus. Who the hell are you?\nDerrick: Just her boyfriend.\nBoon: Oh, yeah? You want to save your girlfriend?\nLoretta: He ain't my boyfriend.\nBoon: Loretta, girl, a boy doesn't become a man until he can make his own decisions.\nYou want to raise up that gun, try and shoot me?\nOr you afraid I'm too fast?\n[gun cocks]\nI am, by the way.\n[gun clicks]\nGood news ... Jenny here, you got to leave her firing chamber empty, avoid an accidental discharge. Bad news ... her chamber's full of promise now. How about we try that again, huh? You not having to clear that holster, boy, that fast approaches a fair...\n[gunshot] [thud]\nDerrick: [groaning and panting]\nBoon: Aw, sh1t. He's still kicking.\nDerrick: [coughs]\nBoon: That's the risk you run going for a head shot, Loretta.\nDerrick: [crying]\nBoon: Well, I figure... you never know when one of these pussies are wearing kevlar, right?\nAlways go for the brain. Best bet.\nDerrick: [panting]\n[coughing]\n[groaning]\nBoon: Don't worry. I'll forgive you.\nVasquez: Where is she? Where's Art?\nWho's running this sh1t show? Where is everybody?\nNelson: Gee, I don't know. The manhunts? Plural?\nVasquez: And they left you to what? Do your nails?\nNelson: Well, if it's any of your business, Vasquez, I'm coordinating.\nVasquez: Oh, well, that's fantastic. Maybe you can coordinate an explanation for this bullshit bulletin.\nNelson: Chief called it in. Looks pretty serious.\nVasquez: You were saying?\nNelson: Having a bad day, David?\nVasquez: Yeah.\nNelson: Hey, Tim, maybe you can help out ...\nTim: Dude, I just came in.\nNelson: He's asking about the bulletin.\nTim: [sighs] Well... when a marshal's life is in danger, we put out a bulletin saying so. Hoping a fellow L.E.O. will bring him into protective custody.\nVasquez: You think I don't know that Givens has gone rogue and that you're closing ranks to avoid a P.R. nightmare? You and everybody in this office is gonna be writing thank-you notes to Art Mullen from the federal penitentiary.\nTim: Your attitude is not helpful.\nVasquez: Open your ears!\nTim: So negative. We're not talking about a write-up. Everybody in here is an accessory to ... to a $10 million heist! Aiding and abetting a fugitive!\nVasquez: Never mind. There's no point.\n[dialing]\nVasquez: Get me S.A.C., uh, Les Levay at the FBI.\nArt: Mullen.\nTim: Oh, hey, Art. What's up?\nArt: Hold on. You're breaking up.\nSee if I can get a signal. Uh, say that again.\nTim: Oh, hey, Art. What's up?\nArt: Oh, you know, scouring the countryside for a dumbass. You?\nTim: Well, I just had Vasquez pissing in my ear about the bulletin. So, it looks like we can't keep the whole \"Raylan Givens gone rogue\" thing in-house.\nArt: Well, he sniffed that out sooner than I'd thought.\nI think he just trashed Nelson's desk, too.\nArt: Well, how'd you leave it?\nTim: Well, he's on the phone now.\nVasquez: Yeah, I'm gonna need a bolo issued for Raylan Givens.\nTim: Fact, I just heard him tell the FBI ballsack to issue a bolo.\nArt: Well, sh1t!\nTim: Wait one.\nVasquez: The plan is as soon as I get him, I'm gonna indict him.\nTim: I just heard him say he wants Raylan indicted.\nArt: Double sh1t.\nBob: Raylan, if you get this, just letting you know I heard the FBI bolo for you on the scanner. I know you're in trouble, and I'm ... I'm on my way.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[garage door squeaking]\n[gasps]\nRaylan, d-d-did you steal my Crown Vic? D... sh1t!\n[sighs]\n[music]\n[grunts]\nAll right, where are you? Aw, there you are. I'm coming for you, Raylan.\n[music]\nRaylan: You ain't Boyd.\nZachariah: Neither are you.\nAppreciate you not shooting me.\nRaylan: Likewise.\nZachariah: Seen the crown of your hat through the window. Boyd don't wear no hat.\nRaylan: Where's Ava?\nAva: [panting] If you get this, call this number. [panting] You better make it fast, though. I'm running out of time.\n[panting]\nWynn: I need a vehicle, a gun, and two passports.\nI want the vehicle to have a compartment, well-hidden, and I mean top-shelf hidden, not some 20-year-old Astro with a false bottom.\nLorna: How much space you need?\nWynn: Enough room for two or three very large duffel bags.\nLorna: Your guy coming, too?\nWynn: No, Mikey's not gonna make it. You know what'd be great? One of those dog-grooming vans. Mobile dog groomers use them.\nLorna: We can paint one up like that, sure.\nWynn: No. A used one.\nLorna: It's not easy. [sighs]\nWynn: By tomorrow. Triple what you paid last time.\nWynn: Fine.\nLorna: Up front.\nWynn: [sighs] Keep the change.\nLorna: Anything else?\nWynn: Yeah, actually... a topographical map of Harlan County would be great.\nRaylan: Do you not see how we want the same thing?\nZachariah: That may be true. But if Boyd ain't been here yet, why you going off looking for Ava? Why don't you just stay here, and we'll take that son of a bitch together?\nRaylan: We don't know for sure if he's coming. He's only coming if he thinks she's here!\nZachariah: And he does think she's here!\nRaylan: But if he don't, if he somehow gets wind of her... before I get to him. I hear what you're saying, but I'm sticking here for the fight.\nRaylan: Well, I'm taking the fight to him. Now, where is she?\nZachariah: I don't know. Maybe she slipped through cranks gap by now. She might be halfway to Jonesville ... maybe Ewing. I don't know. Who she knows in Virginia? Did you set her up? I don't know nobody in Virginia. I don't know where she is, and she didn't tell me. So I can't spill my guts in case you plan on roughing me up again.\nRaylan: You're a waste of space. You're of no help.\nZachariah: Let me tell you something, you son of a bitch! You ain't no better than Boyd! God damn you! The way the two you just scrambled that poor girl's brains! Pull her this way and that way. You used her, god damn you! Ain't no wonder why she burnt the two of you and lit out on her own.\nRaylan: I'm trying to protect her.\nZachariah: Yeah, that may be part of the story, but I bet that ain't the whole goddamn story.\nRaylan: Yeah, you're goddamn right. Where's the money?\nZachariah: [scoffs]\nRaylan: Where is it? It ain't here. It had to weigh a ton. No way she drug it up and over. She went down.\nZachariah: She's gone.\nRaylan: Not as long as I'm looking.\nAva: [panting]\n[grunts]\nOh, god.\nBob: Ava Crowder...\nAva: Aah!\nBob: Step away from the car.\nAva: [panting]\nBob: Step away from my Crown Vic.\nTake that backpack off. Slow.\nAva: [breathing heavily]\nBob: And, hey, don't reach in.\nNo, put it on the ground! On the ground! Ava, don't test me. All right, now get down on your knees. On your knees. [sighs] Sorry if that ... that sounds untoward. Holy sh1t! Holy sh1t. Where ... Where's Raylan?\nAva: I don't know.\nBob: Did you kill him?\nAva: What? No!\nBob: Ava, you're a fugitive from the law. I know you shot your fiancé and I know that Raylan took my Crown Vic. And I tracked it up here. Now, for the last time ...\nAva: The answer to the question is \"no!\" I ain't even seen him.\nBob: I hope for your sake, and for the sake of the Commonwealth of Kentucky that you are telling the truth. Now... lace your fingers behind your head. Behind your head! Okay. Let's get up slowly. Come on. There you go. Walk this way with me. And I'm quick with this gun, case you're getting squirrely. You got that?\nAva: Bob, you know there's a lot more money where that came from, don't you? I mean ...\nBob: I'm gonna take mercy on you.\nI'm not gonna \"attempting to bribe an officer of the law\" to your long list of offenses.\nAnd before you try to seduce me, just know it's been tried before. All right, now, get yourself in the Gremlin there. Open the door. Open the door. All right. Sit yourself down. And when Raylan comes back with my keys, we're gonna make the change, and it's nice in there. I got an air freshener smells like a mocha latte.\n[engine shuts off]\nAva: You hear that?\nBob: Uh, no, I di... Yes, I did.\nAva: It's Boyd.\nBob: Ava, that could be anybody, okay?\nI want you to calm down, all right? Just calm down. Just sit down for a sec.\nAva: Listen to me. Please. He's gonna kill us!\nHagan: Cold out here. Can feel it.\nBoyd: Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.\n[exhales slowly]\nHagan: I appreciate the lie, Mr. Crowder.\nBut we both know what you was thinking. Loose end and all.\nBoyd: You know my mind? Now, maybe I was gonna take your keys, let you walk.\nHagan: [scoffs] So you could shoot me in the back? You're gonna have to look me in the eye, you pull that trigger.\nNah, I knew the minute you stepped in my cab\nI was gonna be staring down the black hole of your gun ... cut me down like the plague you are.\nBoyd: Well, I got to say, you did do a pretty good job ... all that smoke you were blowing up my ass.\nHagan: Ain't no smoke. But I will say this. Stories of outlaw legends, they ain't passed down by the families of the murdered. Well, I don't give a sh1t about \"the Ballad of Boyd Crowder.\" I'll be dead and gone when that song gets sung.\n[exhales slowly]\nHagan: Old boy by the name of Hut McKean mean anything to you?\nBoyd: Let me guess ... I killed him, my men killed him, my dope killed him, or my daddy killed him?\nNext thing that comes out of your mouth is, \"how do you sleep at night, Boyd Crowder?\"\nWell, do you know how?\n'Cause I know who I am. Do you? You're a slave, disenfranchised ... don't even know it. You drive your shitty truck to your shitty house, live out your shitty life. You think you're better than me 'cause you play by the rules? Whose rules? My life is my own.\nHagan: You ain't even heard a word I said.\nBoyd: I don't give a sh1t about what you said. I'm an outlaw.\n[gunshots]\nBob: Stay here. Don't make any noise.\nAva: No! No, no!\nBob! Bob! You can't leave me here like this!\n[sighs]\n[gunshots]\n[gasps]\n[grunting]\n[grunts]\n[breathing heavily]\n[music]\nRaylan: [panting]\n[gunshot]\nBoyd: Ah. Aah.\nGod damn, Raylan!\nHow you know I wasn't some boy scout looking for his tent?!\nRaylan: Your teeth glow in the dark.\nBoyd: You shot unprovoked.\nHow am I supposed to take that?\nRaylan: As me aiming to kill you.\nBoyd: [breathing heavily]\nWell, it's only getting colder.\nSo what say the next time the moon peeks out from behind those clouds, we show it down?\nRaylan: Now you're talking.\nBoyd: Only problem is, Raylan, I don't know where you are.\nRaylan: I don't know where I'm either.\nBoyd: Why you want to kill me so bad, Raylan?\nYou don't even know why. \"Boyd Crowder must die!\"\nThat's just the lie you tell yourself, wanting to win.\nRaylan: You are the world-conquering emperor of lies, the biggest reserved for yourself.\nBoyd: Just say it, Raylan. \"I want to win!\"\nRaylan: [chuckles] How about, \"I want the money\"?\nsh1t. You want to kill her, Boyd.\nYou want to kill the woman who stole your money, shot you, and left you for dead.\nBoyd: You don't know what's in my heart.\nRaylan: What heart?\nBoyd: You don't know what's in your own heart. You've given up everything you are so that you could murder me.\nRaylan: I cross the line with my eyes wide open.\nBoyd: [grunts] Well, whose eyes you gonna see when you kill me, Raylan? Your daddy's?\nRaylan: Not anymore.\nBoyd: Your baby girl's?\nImagine the look on her face the day she realizes,\n\"my daddy spent his whole life trying to walk the line and failed.\"\nRaylan: She'll live her life the way everybody does ... on her own.\nBoyd: Are you sure you don't want me to kill you, Raylan, keep you a hero? That makes for a hell of a bedtime story.\n[grunts]\nRaylan: This is the only story here tonight.\n[shout in distance] Help!\nBoyd: You don't think that's Bob, do you?\nRaylan: Why would that be Bob?\nBoyd: Well, I shot him a couple times down at the trail head.\nI think he might still be alive. You ought to go run down there and see if you can't help him.\nRaylan: Bob can take care of himself.\nBoyd: Well, hell, Raylan.\nThen I have already won.\n[siren wailing]\n[tires screech]\nCrosley: Stop! [gunshot]\nAva: Aah!\n[breathing shakily]\nCrosley: Get down on the ground.\nAva: All right, all right, all right!\nCrosley: Get on the ground!\nBirch: Holy sh1t! There's a shitload of money in here.\nAva: You take me in, you're gonna have to hand that over.\nYou let me go, you can have it.\nCrosley: [chuckles] I do not know what Mr. Markham has got planned for you...\nAva: Wait. ...but I don't want him to do it to me.\nAva: Markham? You're taking me to see Markham?\nCrosley: Get up.\n[grunts]\nGet up, you pussy.\n[car door closes]\n[car alarm chirps]\nMarkham: What the hell is this?\nBoon: Yeah, he tried to pull on me.\nMarkham: You just gonna let him lay there and bleed?\nBoon: Was I supposed to take him to the hospital?\nMarkham: Hope he wasn't someone dear to you.\nLoretta: Just someone I paid to watch my back.\nMarkham: Money not well spent, I'd say.\nLoretta: Well, slim pickings, way you're running roughshod over this county.\nMarkham: Trying to flatter me, girl?\nLoretta: Just wondering what you want from me is all.\nReason I had Boon come looking for you is Ava Crowder stole my money.\nStole it from the man who stole it from me.\nThat man being your new business partner Boyd.\nLoretta: This is the first I'm hearing of it.\nMarkham: I was thinking the two of you being so close, you might have some idea where Ava ran off to.\nEven entered my mind that maybe you two ladies conspired together.\nLoretta: Like I said, first I'm hearing about it.\nMarkham: I believe you. Couple of deputies I became friends with called me on the way over. They picked up Ava Crowder. Bringing her to me directly.\nLoretta: Suppose you won't be needing me anymore, then.\nMarkham: If that's the case, I'll just kill you right now. But I'm gonna give you 30 seconds to change my mind. Tell me why I shouldn't kill you, Loretta McCready.\nLoretta: You can kill me. Go right ahead. Buy all this land I've acquired at auction like you have with others. But bear in mind the time that may take and the unexpected costs it may incur. What I can offer you at this juncture is a partnership. Immediate access not only to my land, but also my growing expertise. Sure, you've got boys like Boon over here know plenty about watching over land, but none of them were raised around these buds like I was. Add to that my ties to Harlan County. Say weed don't get legalized like we think. Well... I can tell you who among those criminal elements you can trust. A partnership with me will tell those same folks that they can trust you.\nMarkham: First time I saw you, I liked you. Didn't much care for what you did at the Pizza Portal, but I saw something in you reminded me of Katherine little bit. More than that, reminded me of Mags Bennett. I could use a Harlan girl in my fold. Besides, I think old Boon here is sweet on you.\nRaylan: Bob? Oh, jeez...\nBob: Raylan. Raylan. [muttering]\n[grunts]\nRaylan: Jesus Christ, Bob. [grunts]\nBob: Just keep applying pressure, Raylan.\nKeep ...\nRaylan: I know, Bob. ... to the point of impact to stanch the flow of blood.\nRaylan: Hey, just keep that pad pressed up against your gut, Bob.\nBob: I am, okay? I just... [stammers] Just ask me anything ... trivia. \"W-What ... What was Indiana Jones' archenemy?\" Just ask me. Ask me.\nRaylan: Bob, just breathe, buddy. Just breathe. Bob. Bob!\nRaylan: sh1t.\n[cellphone beeps, ringing]\nI got an officer shot. At least two in him... gut and shoulder.\nBob: The monkey's dead. Don't eat the ...\nRaylan: Hang in there, Bob.\nBob: They call him Belosh.\nRaylan: A-A-And link up to U.S. Marshals' task force.

I don't think there's another unicorn in all of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight.\nSnails: (heavy Canadian accent) Gaaaangway! Comin' through!\n(Spike grunts)\nSpike: Snips...Snails...w-what's going on?!\nSnails: Why, haven't you heard?\n(Spike yelps, crashes)\nThere's a new unicorn in town!\nSnips: (hyperventilating) Yeah! They say she's got more magical powers than any other unicorn EVER!\nTwilight: Really?\nSpike: Aw, no way. That honor goes to Twilight here!\nTwilight: Where is this unicorn?\nTrixie: (amplified) Come one! Come all! (trilling r's) Come and witness the amazing magic of the Grrreat and Powerrrful Trrrrixie!\n(ponies ooh and ahh)\n(theatrical) Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie performs the most spectacular feats of pony magic ever witnessed by pony eyes!\n(pyrotechnics burst, fanfare plays)\nRarity: (unimpressed) My, my, my! What boasting!\nSpike: Come on, no pony's as magical as Twili- (flustered) Twi- Twi- O-oh! (clears throat)\n(bashful) Hey, Rarity, I, uh... MOUSTACHE!\nTwilight: There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there?\nApplejack: Nothin' at all, 'ceptin' when someone goes around showin' it off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons.\nRarity: Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us.\nRainbow Dash: Especially when ya got me around bein' better than the rest of us. (chuckles) Uh, I mean, (unconvincing) yeah, uh, magic-shmagic! Boo!\nTrixie: Well, well, well. It looks like we have some (neighing) neigh [nay] sayers in the audience! Who is so IGNORANT as to challenge the magical ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie?! Do they not know that they're in the presence of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?!\nRarity: (raspberry) Just WHO does she think she is?\nSpike: Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is-\nTwilight: (whispering) Spike! Shh!\nSpike: What? What's wrong?\nTwilight: Did you see how they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking I'M a showoff!\n(drumroll, fanfare, pyrotechnics)\nRainbow Dash: So, \"Great and Powerful Trixie,\" what makes you think you're so awesome, anyway?\nTrixie: (self-amused chuckle) Why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie has magic strong enough to VANQUISH! THE DREADED!\nURSA MAJOR!\n(fanfare, pyrotechnics)\n(audience ahhs)\nSnips: What?! Snails: No way!\nTrixie: When all hope was lost, the ponies of Hoofington [Huffington] had no one to turn to,\n(robotic growling) but the Great and Powerful Trixie stepped in,\n(mechanical growling) and with her awesome magic\n(static fizzle) vanquished the Ursa Major and sent it back to its cave\ndeep within the Everfree Forest!\nSnips: Aw, sweet!\nSnails: Sa-weet!\nSnips: That settles it.\nSnails: Trixie really is the most talented, most magical, most awesome unicorn in Ponyville.\nSnips: No! In all of Equestria!\nSpike: How d'you know?! You didn't see it! And besides, Twi- (zip) Mmf! Mmf!\n(haughty chuckle)\n(stroking ego) It's true, my enthusiastic little admirer. Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville!\n(crickets chirping)\nWell then, I hereby challenge you, (derisively) Ponyvillians:(boastful) Anything you can do, I can do better. Any takers? Anyone?\nOr is Trixie destined to be the greatest equine that has EVER LIVED?!\n(fanfare, pyrotechnics)\nSpike: (unzips mouth, pleads) Ple-e-ease! She's unbearable! You gotta show her! You just gotta! (sobs)\nTwilight: (whispering) There's no way I'm gonna use my magic now, Spike! Especially since-\nTrixie: Hmm...how about...YOU!\n(Twilight gulps nervously)\nTrixie: Well, how about it? Hmm?\n(condescending) Is there anything YOU can do that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't?!\nTwilight: (meekly) I...I...\n(banjo strumming)\nTrixie: Well, little hayseed?\nApplejack: That's it! I can't stand for no more o'this!\nSpike: You show her, AJ!\nApplejack: Can your magical powers do...THIS?!\n(spirited country music, rope twirling)\n(ponies ooh)\n(spirited country music, rope twirling)\n(spirited country music)\n(chomps, gulps, music ends)\n(ponies cheer raucously)\nApplejack: Top THAT, missy.\nTrixie: (unfazed) Oh ye of little talent.\nWatch and be amazed at the magic of Trixie!\n(Arabian music)\nApplejack: Whoa! (grunts, crashes into ground)\n(Arabian music)\n(ponies cheer)\nTrixie: Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails.\nRainbow Dash: There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that!\nTrixie: Oh?\nRainbow Dash: That's MY job!\n(rock music)\n(windmill grinds)\n(rock music)\n(repeated thumps)\n(rock music)\n(rock music)\n(rising pitch whoosh)\n(rock music)\n(whoosh, whoosh, whoosh)\n(rock music)\n(rising pitch whoosh)\n(rock music)\n(windmill grinds)\n(rock music)\n(whoosh, brakes squeal)\n(rock music)\n(rock music ends)\nThey don't call me \"Rainbow\" and \"Dash\" for nothin'!\n(ponies cheer)\nTrixie: When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser.\n(magical humming)\n(Rainbow Dash screaming)\n(sped up calliope music)\nRainbow Dash: (weakly) I think I'm gonna be...sick...\nTrixie: Seems like any pony with a [Rainbow] \"dash\" of good sense would think twice before tussling with the Great Trixie!\n(thunder, Rainbow Dash shrieks)\n(ponies laugh, Trixie laughs haughtily)\nSpike: What we need is another unicorn to challenge her!\n(hinting) Someone with some magic of her own?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! A unicorn to show THIS unicorn who's boss!\nApplejack: A real unicorn-to-unicorn tussle!\nTwilight: Uh...\nRarity: Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense. Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace.\nTrixie: (mocking) Ooh, what's the matter? (provoking) Afraid you'll get a hair out of place in that rat's nest you call a mane?\nRarity: Oh. It. Is. ON. You may think you're tough with all of your so-called \"powers,\" but there's more to magic than your brutish ways. A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle.\nA unicorn needs to have style.\n(classical music)\n(classical music)\nA unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.\n(classical music, audience oohs)\n(magical humming)\n(classical music)\nSpike: Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her!\n(classical music)\nShe's strong, she's beautiful, she's- (poof)\n(classical music)\n(ponies gasp and recoil)\nRarity: (panicked) QUICK! I NEED A MIRROR! GET ME A MIRROR!\n(squealing) What did she do to my hair?! I know she did something terrible to my hair!\nTwilight: (nervously) N-nothing!\nRainbow Dash: (hastily) It's fine!\nApplejack: (dazed) It's gorgeous!\nSpike: (tactless) It's green. What?\nRarity: (tearing up) No! Green hair! Not green hair! (sobs theatrically) That's an awful, AWFUL color! (sobs)\nPony: Well, I never!\n[supposed to be a green-haired female Carrot Top]\nSpike: Well, Twilight, I guess it's up to you. Come on, show her what you're made of!\nTwilight: (deflecting) What do you mean? I-I'm nothing special...\nSpike: Yes you ARE! You're better than her!\nTwilight: I'm not better than anyone!\nTrixie: Hah! You think you're better than the Great and Powerful Trixie? You think you have MORE magical talent? (provoking) Well, come on. Show Trixie what you've got. Show us all.\nTwilight: Who, me? I'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of Ponyville! No powerful magic here. I, uh, think I hear my laundry calling. Sorry!\nSpike: Twilight?\nTrixie: Ha! Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all of Equestria! (under breath) Was there ever any doubt?\nSnips: Here's the smoothie you asked for! With extra hay! Just how you like it.\nSnails: (slow, dull speech) Mm, hay.\n(slurping)\nTrixie: (annoyed) Yes?\nSnips: Oh! Tell us another story, Great and Powerful Trixie!\nSnails: Yeah, tell us about how you vanquished the Ursa Major!\nTrixie: (derisively) Hmph! TRIXIE is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination.\nBEGONE with you until morning.\nSnails: Oh, of course, Great and Powerful Trixie!\nSnips: Anything you say! We are at your beck and call!\n(sighs haughtily)\nSpike: What're YOU two doin'?\nSnips: Just bringin' the G. and P. T. a-\nSpike: ...The what?\nSnips: The Great and Powerful Trixie!\nSpike: Sheesh.\nSnips: Just bringin' her a smoothie!\nSpike: How can you fall for her lameness?! She's just a showoff.\nSpike: Unlike Twilight, who-\nSnips: The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished an Ursa Major.\nCan your \"Twilight\" claim that?\nSpike: Oh, really? Were you guys actually there?\nSnips: Well, eh...uh...no, but-\nSpike: But nothin'. The proof is in the pudding!\nSnails: (slow-witted laughter) I like pudding.\nSpike: ...Look, unless an Ursa Major comes waltzing up the street for Trixie to vanquish, I am NOT gonna believe a word she says! And neither should you!\nSnips: Hmm! An Ursa walkin' up the street, eh? (a la Brain [Pinky and the Brain]) Snails, you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?\nSnails: (a la Pinky) Why is it they call it a flea market when they don't really sell fleas?\nSnips: Yeah! Uh... (doubletakes) Oh, uh...come on!\nSpike: Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me?\nTwilight: Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike? If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends.\nSpike: It's not the same thing, Twilight! You'd be using your magic to stand up for your friends!\nTwilight: No, Spike! It's exactly the same!\nSpike: Come on, Twilight. Any one of these tricks, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie.\nTwilight: I don't wanna be seen as a bragger like Trixie!\n(door slams shut)\nSpike: (opens door) But you're the BEST!\nTwilight: (exasperated sigh) Please, Spike! I said, \"No!\"\nSpike: (sighs) If that's the way you wanna be, fine. (slams door)\n(door opens)\n(spooky theremin music)\n(owl hoots)\n(spooky theremin music)\nSnips: (apprehensively) Oh, how we gonna find an Ursa Major when I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face?!\nSnails: Hold on!\n(grunts fiercely)\nSnips: Oh! Heh, that's better.\n(low growl)\n(growling)\n(Snails screams)\n(Snails and Snips scream)\n(Snails and Snips scream, Ursa roars)\n(Spike kicking rock)\n(melancholy harp music)\n(Snips screaming)\nSpike: Hey, guys.\n(Snails panting) Where ya goin'?\nSnips: Can't talk now!\nSnails: Got a \"MAJOR\" problem!\nSnips: Yeah! URSA Major, to be exact!\n(roar)\nSpike: ...Huh?\n(paw impacts ground)\n(roar)\nSnips and Snails: TRIXIIIIE!\nSpike: Twilight!\n(loud thuds, trees falling)\n(Snips and Snails banging on door and clamoring for Trixie)\nTrixie: (annoyed) Trixie thought she said the Great and Powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed!\nSnips: (nervous laughter) We-We have a...a tiny problem...\nSnails: (flatly) Actually, it's a big one.\nTrixie: WHAT is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie?!\n(distant roar, thud)\n(repeated thuds)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(fierce roar)\n(Trixie screams)\n(Snips and Snails scream)\n(Ursa snarls, crushes cart)\n(roar)\nSpike: (frantic) Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick!\nTwilight: I've already told you, Spike! I don't wanna show up Trixie!\nSpike: No! You don't understand! It's-\n(roar, thud)\nTwilight: (nervously) ...Uh, is that what I think it is?\nSpike: [Ursa] Majorly...\nSnips: Great and Powerful Trixie! You've got to vanquish the Ursa!\nSnails: (oblivious) Yeah! Vanquish so we can watch!\nSnips: It took a LOT of trouble to get that thing here!\nTrixie: Wait! YOU brought this here?! (gasps) Are you out of your little pony MINDS?!\nSnips: But...you're the Great and Powerful Trixie!\nSnails: Yeah, remember? You defeated an Ursa Major!\n(Ursa roars)\nTrixie: (nervously) U-uh, okay...\n(gulps) Stand back...\n(Arabian music)\n(uncertain) Heh! Piece o'cake!\n(snap)\nSnips: Aw, c'mon, Trixie!\nSnails: (very Canadian) Stop goofin' around and vanquish it, eh?\n(Trixie gasps, gulps)\n(ominous music)\n(thunder)\nSnails: (flatly) Well. That was a dud.\nSnips: Yeah, c'mon! Where's all the cool explosions and smoke and stuff like earlier?! You know!\n(Ursa winces)\n(Ursa growls)\nTrixie: (meekly) Uh-oh.\n(roar)\n(ponies screaming)\n(Ursa roars)\n(Ursa roars, ponies gasp fearfully)\n(roar, crash)\n(ponies panicking)\nTwilight: What's going on?!\nSnips: (proudly) We brought an Ursa to town!\nTwilight: You WHAT?!\nSnails: Don't worry! The Great and Powerful Trixie'll vanquish it!\nTrixie: (defeated) I can't.\nSnips and Snails: What?!\nTrixie: Uh, I can't. I never have.\nNo one can vanquish an Ursa Major. I just made the whole story up to make me look better!\nSnips and Snails: Made it up?!\n(guttural growl)\n(roar)\n(ponies gasp)\n(Twilight gulps)\n(Ursa growls, paws impact ground)\n(Twilight groans, wind blows)\n(lullaby-style music from cattails)\n(Ursa growls, subsides)\n(lullaby-style music from cattails)\nSpike: Nice use of Number !\n(rising volume magical chiming)\n(metal creaking)\n(water flowing)\n(magical chiming)\n(cows mooing in contented surprise)\nDeeper-voiced cow: Call me, don'tcha know?\nSpike: ...That's new.\n(metallic clank)\n(Ursa growling sleepily)\n(Twilight grunting heavily)\n(Ursa slurping)\n(Ursa sucking noisily)\n(loud magical humming)\n(sucking)\n(Twilight grunts exhaustedly)\n(ponies cheering)\nSpike: Unbelievable!\nThat was amazing!\nApplejack: Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not THAT much!\nTwilight: I'm sorry! Please, please don't hate me!\nRainbow Dash, Applejack, Rarity: Hate you?!\nRarity: Why, whatever do you mean, darling?\nTwilight: Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie showing off with her magic tricks, and I just thought-\nRainbow Dash: Whoa, whoa, whoa. MAGIC'S got nothin' to do with it!\nRainbow Dash: Trixie's just a loudmouth.\nRarity: MOST unpleasant.\nApplejack: All hat and no cattle.\nTwilight: So...you don't mind my magic tricks?\nApplejack: Your magic is a part o'who you are, sugarcube, and we like who you are. We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend.\nRainbow Dash: And after whuppin' that Ursa's hindquarters, we're even prouder!\nTwilight: You are?!\nRainbow Dash: Uh-huh!\nApplejack and Rarity: Mm-hmm!\nSpike: Wow, Twilight! How'd you know what to do with that Ursa Major?!\nTwilight: That's what I was doing when you came looking for me! I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.\nSpike: So, it IS possible to vanquish an Ursa Major all by yourself?\nTwilight: That wasn't an Ursa Major. That was a baby. An Ursa MINOR.\nTrixie: THAT was just a baby?!\nTwilight: And it wasn't rampaging. It was just cranky because SOMEone woke it up.\n(Snips and Snails groan bashfully)\nSpike: Well...if that was an Ursa Minor, then... (fearfully) what's an Ursa MAJOR like?!\n(Ursa Minor growls contentedly)\nTwilight: ...You don't wanna know.\nTrixie: (haughtily) Hah! You may have vanquished an Ursa MINOR, but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability\nof the Great and Powerful Trixie!\n(poof, hooves clop into distance)\nRainbow Dash: Why, that little...!\nTwilight: Just let her go.\nMaybe someday she'll learn her lesson. Now...About you two.\nSnips: Uh, (nervous chuckle) we're sorry that we woke up the Ursa Minor...\nSnails: We just wanted to see some AWESOME MAGIC!\nSnips: Yeah! And the way you vanquished that Ursa Minor was...AWESOME!\nSnails: We deserve whatever punishment you give us.\nTwilight: For starters, you can clean up this mess. And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them... (ominously) Number ?\nSpike: Ohhh, Twenty-five, yes! And I think I deserve it, too.\nSnips and Snails: Huh?!\nTwilight: I think you're right.\n(humming)\n(three pops)\nSnips, Snails, Spike: Sweeeet!\nTwilight: (voice-over) \"Dear Princess Celestia,\nI have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship. I was so afraid of being thought of as a show-off that I was hiding a part of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off... especially when you're standing up for your friends.\"\nSpike: So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?\nTwilight: Well...yeah. But it's nothing to brag about. But it's nothing to brag about. So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?\nSpike: (sighs) She didn't go for the moustache.\nTwilight: You know, Spike, that moustache has nothing to do with who you really are. Maybe you should just try being yourself!\nSpike: Or...maybe the moustache wasn't enough! Maybe if I had a moustache AND a beard!\nTwilight: Oh, not THIS again...\nSpike: Okay, imagine me with a nice, long Fu Manchu type beard. Or maybe a goatee. Or, no...

I know Dopey's a tree, but we got to be more productive since he can't.\nHappy: He's producing oxygen. (Laughter)\nGrumpy: Hey. Let's stay focused.\nEmma: Yes. No one wants a nasty surprise.\nGrumpy: You're not getting any dust, sister.\nEmma: Actually, I'm shopping for something else today. Something with... edge.\nHappy: My axe.\nEmma: Oh, Happy, there's something I learned as the Dark One. If your name is on something, hold on to it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Camelot. Six weeks ago. Merlin's tower.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRegina: If we're going to free Merlin, we need witchbane.\nBelle: Yeah, but the labels are all faded.\nEmma: Forget the decloaking potion. It's not a glamour anyway.\nRegina: You sure?\nMary Margaret: If I'm getting this right, the tree could actually be him transfigured, right?\nBelle: We could find out with a sample.\nRegina: Yeah, and when we snap off a twig and it turns into a finger, who's crying then? Come on, someone. Witchbane.\nEmma: You guys sure you don't want me to just wiggle my nose and get him out of that tree?\nMary Margaret: No.\nRegina: Your magic is dark now. It's not worth it. I'll just keep pretending to be the savior destined to free him, and we can do this together.\nDavid: Regina's right, Emma.\nArthur: I heard someone say a woman is right. That's always a safe assumption, isn't it, David?\nKing Arthur: How are you progressing, Madame Savior?\nRegina: Um... progress. Slow but sure.\nBelle: It's, uh... marvelous having Merlin's own books to work with. It's like talking with the master.\nMary Margaret: Oh. What if we could talk to him?\nEmma: What?\nRegina: Yes. (Chuckles) You are... very occasionally... a genius.\nBelle: Yes, if we talked to him, he can tell us how to get him out.\nDavid: A mushroom.\nRegina: Toadstool, actually. Deadly poison. Extremely useful in communicating across barriers, even through spells. Says here it's called the Crimson Crown.\nKing Arthur: Yes, I know this name. It's rumored to grow in Brocéliande, the Forest of Eternal Night. Its existence is the stuff of legend, though. Almost certainly fiction.\nDavid: People say the same thing about us. How far?\nKing Arthur: A half day's ride. But if it is there, it'll be protected by magical forces.\nMary Margaret: You know what, David? Wait until we know more.\nDavid: It's not like I'm needed here. It's a chance.\nMary Margaret: Oh. Aww.\nDavid: I'm taking it.\n(Indistinct conversations)\nKing Arthur: Hold!\nDavid: Your Majesty. Don't try to talk me out of this.\nKing Arthur: I wouldn't dream of it. I just wanted to propose, Prince David, if it's quite all right with you, that I come along and lend aid. Come with me and we can get ourselves outfitted, and then we can quest together as brothers.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Sheriff's station.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRegina: This question mark... That's my handwriting. I must've marked this page in Camelot. I don't know if this is the right answer, but these books came from there. I think we were looking at this for answers.\nGrumpy: We've been violated!\nDavid: What's the problem?\nGrumpy: What do you think it is? Your kid.\nHappy: She took my axe.\nRegina: Uh, dwarfs are your department. I'll stay on this.\nMary Margaret: What do you want us to do about it, Leroy?\nGrumpy: Help us. We know she's your daughter, but you got to do something, 'cause if you won't, we will.\nMary Margaret: Do not hurt her.\nDavid: It's okay. They can't.\nGrumpy: Like that's all that matters? Stop being a scared parent. Be our sheriff again. We need you.\nDavid: I'll see about getting the axe back. Thanks for letting us know.\nGrumpy: Looks like just another insult for us to swallow down. For now.\n(Sighs)\n(Indistinct conversations)\nMary Margaret: Why does she need an axe? That's alarming, right?\nDavid: I don't know. I mean, what could she do with an axe that she couldn't just do with her powers?\n(David kicks a chair)\nMary Margaret: David!\nDavid: Just wish she'd talk to us.\nMary Margaret: I know. Me, too.\nDavid: Worst part is... we can't save her.\nMary Margaret: Yet. We're trying.\nDavid: How? What am I doing?\nMary Margaret: You're leading.\nDavid: Nobody seems to be following.\nMary Margaret: Oh, don't worry about the dwarfs.\nDavid: I'm not. I'm worried about Emma and how this is my fault.\nMary Margaret: She made the choice to save everyone.\nDavid: I should've stopped her. I am her father, and now I'm... I'm paralyzed. There's nothing I can do, for her, for you, for anyone.\nMary Margaret: You are doing something. You are helping our people the best you can.\nDavid: That's kind of the problem.\nMary Margaret: Hey. In any world, you are my hero. Remember?\nDavid: Of course. Go. I've got it.\n(Door opens)\nKing Arthur: Good morning to you, Sheriff.\nDavid: Your Majesty. How can I help you? Any luck finding your blade?\nKing Arthur: No luck finding Excalibur, I'm afraid, but I'm coming to you with something far more urgent. Our reliquary's been robbed.\nDavid: I'm sorry, your what?\nKing Arthur: Magical relics collected by the Knights of the Round Table. They're all very precious. I had no idea it was here until it turned up in this land nearly empty.\nDavid: When you say precious...\nKing Arthur: There was a magic bean inside. This bean can take my people home in an instant. I have to tell you I will find it if I have to search every residence in your city.\nDavid: You don't have to do anything alone.\nKing Arthur: You can help?\nDavid: I'll get you back to Camelot. I promise.\nKing Arthur: Thank you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Emma's house. Basement.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Emma goes to swing the dwarf axe at the Stone of Destiny which is holding Excalibur.)\nDarkness: A dwarf axe. Now, that's a creative path to failure.\nEmma: Dwarf axes cut through everything.\nDarkness: Nothing cuts through magic. Except maybe a kiss. Have you thought about kissing it out?\n(Laughs as the axe breaks on the stone)\nDarkness: You're running out of options, deary. You see, we want you to, uh, snuff out the light. So, we need a hero to pull Excalibur from the stone. Now... and let's face facts that's not gonna be you. So, why don't you stop messing around and go get the hero we need? Oh, and, uh, you and I both know who that is.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Camelot. Six weeks ago. Merlin's tower.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Sighs)\nRobin Hood: It's all right. You'll get it. Perhaps it's time for a spot of tea. Calm nerves lead to clear thoughts.\nRegina: You're here so I can keep an eye on you, mute handmaiden. I don't need you rolling your eyes at me. We need to clear the air. Fine. (Whoosh)\nZelena: Ah! (Laughs) Oh, there you are, my lovely voice. It's so... light and feminine.\nRegina: Enough. Now... let's have a little chat about you trying to escape back to Oz. Zelena... you know you can't take that child away from Robin.\nZelena: Can you blame me? You're going to take it from me. This child could be my only chance for someone to truly love me, and... you got a second chance. Why can't I?\nRegina: Oh, I'm sorry. But you've had a second chance and a second second chance. You can't keep painting yourself as a victim. It's absurd.\nZelena: You can tell me that life is fair all you want. All I can tell you is that from in here, I'm still seeing one sister with all the toys...\n(whoosh)\nRegina: Be quiet and listen for once in your life.\nZelena: (Stomps foot)\nRegina: You forgot who I am. The Evil Queen. I can be a far greater nightmare than you can possibly imagine. But now... my gift to you is a promise. I will make sure your baby is fine and loved and safe. Just as I promise... The same will certainly not hold for you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Camelot. Six weeks ago. The Round Table.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDavid: Wow.\nKing Arthur: I like to be prepared.\nDavid: Is that... Percival chair?\nKing Arthur: Yes. But no need for more apologies. A leader does what needs to be done. I'll find a man worthy to fill that seat.\n(Arthur gestures to the tallest chair at the table.)\nKing Arthur: This is the one that will stand empty forever.\nDavid: I assume that was your chair. Suitable for a king.\nKing Arthur: No. Mine is no different than the others in the same way that the table is round. Many of our order are kings and princes in their own realms. Nonetheless, happy to sit shoulder to shoulder with the rest of their knights. No one of us above the other. Except for this one. This is the Siege Perilous. Reserved for the knight with the purest heart, the one destined to carry out the most sacred quests. Belonged to a man I trusted more than a brother. But he betrayed me. It's been vacant since.\nDavid: Lancelot.\nKing Arthur: You've heard of him.\nDavid: Well, all of you are kind of legends.\nKing Arthur: Really? I shudder to think what our tale must be.\nDavid: Oh, only one of the greatest romances of all time. Your love for Guinevere was ripped away by your best friend, Lancelot. It's a tragic story that clearly had a happy ending. The two of you seem like all that's in the past now.\nKing Arthur: Yes. Lancelot was a good man. The situation was difficult.\nDavid: I understand. Actually, Snow... Mary Margaret and I, we met him.\nKing Arthur: You did? How is he?\nDavid: I'm... very sorry to tell you this, but we... learned that he died. I'm sorry.\nKing Arthur: Lancelot failed to resist temptation, but he was a good knight. He tortured himself for his sins far more than I would've done. I wished him happy. Just not with my wife.\n(Door opens)\nArthur: (Clears throat)\n(Trunk thuds)\nKing Arthur: Careful. This... is our reliquary, containing our sacred magical items our knights have recovered.\nDavid: I've never seen magic like that.\nKing Arthur: It's the Unquenchable Flame. Said to be part of the burning bush itself. This will light our path, and where we're going, we're gonna need it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Camelot camp.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSquire: The reliquary, Your Majesty.\nDavid: So, you're the one who found this broken into? Any theories?\nSquire: Me? Oh, well, um... everyone speaks of the Dark One in this place. Perhaps...\nKing Arthur: Stop being a fool, man.\nDavid: Arthur, to be honest, she did take a dwarf axe.\nKing Arthur: And, as you're about to say, the Dark One doesn't need tools. This lock was pried open. You can see the scratches.\nDavid: You're right.\nKing Arthur: This is your land. What are you thinking?\nDavid: I'm thinking I may not know who did this. But I think I have a good idea of what their next move will be.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Granny's.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nHook: Ah, I know that look. Button on the top turns it on.\nRobin Hood: I know how to use a phone.\nHook: What's that, then?\nRobin Hood: It's a picture from up inside Zelena.\nHook: Whoa, mate.\nRobin Hood: No, n-no. It's of the baby. They... they call it a sonogram.\nHook: Oh. Mixed emotions, I bet.\nRobin Hood: (Sighs) I mean, I know it's painful for Regina. Her evil sister carrying my child. It's painful for me. And yet there's some part of me that can't help but feel happy. It's my child. And I sure don't want Regina to know that. I don't want her to misconstrue my happiness for, well...\nHook: You got yourself a complex situation there, that's for sure.\nRobin Hood: Hmm. Unlike your simple love life.\nHook: Ha. About that. She's not the same. Her new house, there's a door in there that she doesn't want me anywhere near. What do you suppose she's hiding? I was thinking that may...\nGranny: Order up.\nHook: Order? I didn't order anything.\nRobin Hood: What does it say?\nHook: \"Meet me on your ship. Emma.\"\nRobin Hood: You're right. Things are complicated all over.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Jolly Roger (the real Lady Washington) at the docks.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Hook enters the cabin.)\n(Floor creaks)\nHook: That's not funny appearing like that.\nEmma: Sorry.\nHook: What's going on?\nEmma: I know this has all been really confusing and I have not made it any easier. I wanted to apologize for overreacting last time. I know you're just trying to help. So, I thought... We could just talk and have lunch, like old times.\nHook: I'd like nothing more. But this is hardly like old times.\n(Hook sets the bag of food down on the table, which is transformed into a banquet with a checkered table cloth. Emma is now in her pink dress, with her undyed blonde hair in a pony tail.)\nEmma: Better? Come on. You know you can trust me.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Camelot. Six weeks ago. Brocéliande, the Forest of Eternal Night.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDavid: What is it, noon? You weren't kidding about eternal night. I'm glad we have a torch.\nKing Arthur: I'm glad we sent Grif home with the horses. These woods would make him restless.\nDavid: Your squire works hard, Your Majesty.\nKing Arthur: \"And you don't thank him enough.\" I can hear you saying it even when you don't. You're right, though. I don't even have the excuse of ignorance. I was born a common man and I've been in service myself.\nDavid: You weren't born noble?\nKing Arthur: (Chuckles) I'm as peasant as they come.\nDavid: Shepherd.\nKing Arthur: Ah. (Chuckles) I can feel my backbone relaxing already. Let's stop with the \"Your Majesties,\" shall we?\nDavid: Of course.\nKing Arthur: As for my squire, I assure you Guin more than makes up the difference. Showering him and the others with gifts. She really is the kindest woman I've ever met.\nDavid: Sounds like my wife. When she decides you're family, she'd die for you.\nKing Arthur: That's not to say Guin doesn't have her fierce side. With a bow and arrow, I've seen her take out the eye of a dove in flight.\nDavid: Mary Margaret could do that. She wouldn't, but she could.\nKing Arthur: We should have a tourney. Get them to compete.\nDavid: (Chuckling) Right. 'Cause I'm sure they'd love to be pitted against each other to let us feel good about ourselves.\nKing Arthur: Here. Then perhaps there are better ways for me to show off.\nDavid: You're a competitive man for someone with a round table. I thought the idea was you didn't want to sit above anyone.\nKing Arthur: Someone who isn't competitive doesn't need a two-ton table to remind him to be humble.\nDavid: (Chuckles)\nKing Arthur: I know my weaknesses. Lancelot and Guinevere weren't the only ones to blame for what happened to them. I was a difficult man to live with. But I made a conscious decision to fix things.\nDavid: I understand that.\nKing Arthur: This way.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Camelot. Six weeks ago. Brocéliande, the Forest of Eternal Night. Lake.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKing Arthur: Look upon that, brother.\nDavid: So it is real. Crimson Crown. (Spyglass closes)\n(David steps on the bridge, and sinks into the water.)\nDavid: It'll never take both of us. I'll go.\nKing Arthur: I'll wait here. Let the torch be your beacon back.\nDavid: Thank you.\n(Wood creaks)\n(Chuckles softly)\n(Wood cracks)\n(David starts to cross the bridge, and falls. Armor shines in the water.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Gold's shop.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDavid: How's he doing?\nBelle: Not well.\nDavid: I'm sorry.\nBelle: Yeah. But I-I found a healing spell in one of his old notebooks, and I've got everything put together except for one last ingredient. I, uh, I need an object that touched him when he was still a man, before he became the Dark One.\nDavid: You must have something.\nBelle: Well, nothing I can find. Still more to look through, though.\nDavid: You want me to get you some help?\nBelle: No. I'm the only one who knows this place, knows his things, and I need to keep doing something.\nDavid: Well, then we'll make this quick. Has anyone come in to pawn anything today?\nKing Arthur: Especially a magic bean.\nBelle: Uh, a bean? No. No one's come in. Sorry.\nDavid: Ah, it was worth a shot. That's all right. You have something else I need. May I borrow this?\n(David picks up a silver chalice.)\nBelle: Uh, yeah.\nDavid: Good. This is gonna point us right at our culprit.\nKing Arthur: What is it?\nBelle: It's not magic, though. It's just a souvenir from Doc's birthday party. It says \"Doctoberfest\" on it.\nDavid: I'm very well aware. Don't worry. I've got this.\n(Bell jingles)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Camelot camp.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nDavid: Attention, subjects of Camelot! In my hand, you see the Chalice of Vengeance. There's been a theft in your encampment.\n(Murmuring)\nDavid: The chalice will tell me which among you is the thief. So, line up for your chance to drink from the sacred cup.\n(Footsteps running)\n(Crowd gasps, murmurs)\n(Horse neighs)\nSquire: Hyah!\n(King Arthur's squire rides off on his horse, and David grabs his truck to pursue. King Arthur calls shotgun.)\nDavid: Hold on!\nSquire: Hyah! Hyah!\nDavid: Take over! Speed is feet, direction is hand.\n(David climbs into the back of the truck as King Arthur takes the wheel.)\n(Horse neighs)\nDavid: Circle around!\n(Horse neighs)\n(Panting)\n(Gasping)\n(David uses a wooden plank as a joust to knock the squire off the horse.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Camelot. Six weeks ago. Brocéliande, the Forest of Eternal Night. Lake.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(David cuts the mushroom from the island, while the armor underwater starts to move. The armor rises out of the water and attacks David. One armor pulls David underwater, and King Arthur saves him by pulling David up.)\nDavid: Thank you.\nKing Arthur: Think nothing of it. It would appear you did it. Well done.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Jolly Roger (real Lady Washington). Cabin.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nHook: I have questions.\nEmma: You want to know if I'm still the same Emma.\nHook: I imagine that's not a simple answer, so let's start easy. Your new house. What's behind that locked door?\n(Emma just looks at Hook.)\nHook: You know I want to trust you, Emma. Why don't you help me?\nEmma: So trust me. With my powers, I could hide anything from your prying eyes, anyway.\nHook: Well, you've answered my first question, too. You're not the same Emma. She didn't play games.\nEmma: (Clears throat) Yes. I'm different. I'm better.\nHook: As the Dark One.\nEmma: I used to be scarred and judgmental and closed off. Took me forever to see the magic in this place. And now I... I see things clearly. I'm not scared anymore. Honestly, I'm an open book, if you're willing to take that trust step.\nHook: Are you really suggesting that we move forward in a real relationship?\nEmma: Gold and Belle loved each other.\nHook: I don't think you should use the Crocodile as your example.\nEmma: But think about it. He was born a coward. He didn't find true love until he was the Dark One. You told me how the man he was groveled and cried on the deck of this ship. He changed for the better, too.\nHook: You're wrong. I was the villain in that little drama, Swan. He was a good man trying to keep his family together. I took this cutlass and put it to his head and taunted him. I was the only one there who's changed for the better. He became an evil, manipulative killer.\nEmma: Do you remember when we were in the Storybook and I taught you how to swordplay?\nHook: More games. Enough, Swan! All I wanted was your honesty. But I'm done... humoring you. Answer me. And start by why you brought me here. It wasn't because this is what we used to do, because that you isn't here. You need something, Dark One. Tell me what it is.\nEmma: All I need is your trust. I promise.\nHook: I liked you the way you were. I liked your walls. I liked being the one to break them down.\nEmma: The person you found inside is still me. I have a question for you for once. Do you love me? If you tell me you don't love me, I will let you go.\nHook: I loved you. I guess I'm either steering home or swimming home. Tell me which.\nEmma: The ship's yours.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Camelot. Six weeks ago. Brocéliande, the Forest of Eternal Night. Lake.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Both panting)\nKing Arthur: David, what is it?\nDavid: The toadstool. It's gone. Either the phantom knights took it, or it was lost in the bog.\nKing Arthur: We could search for it.\nDavid: No. It's gone.\nKing Arthur: The word \"quest\" means to seek, not to find. It's the seeking that matters.\nDavid: You believe that?\nKing Arthur: Not truly, no. If the finding is what makes a difference in this world, then that's what I want. I'm sorry.\nDavid: (Laughs) My father, he drank his life away. My brother accomplished nothing but evil. There was a time I thought I'd be different. Change the world. But I just... I don't want to only be remembered as the man who kissed a sleeping princess awake 30 years ago.\nKing Arthur: I understand.\nDavid: You do?\nKing Arthur: (Sighs)\nDavid: You're King of Camelot.\nKing Arthur: (Chuckles) Yes, some large rock decided I was a hero. Prophecy fulfilled.\n(Both chuckle)\nKing Arthur: But since then, I've had victories and I've had losses. And I've learned that it's the losses that require us to be brave. So, if anything will make us heroes...\nDavid: It's the never giving up. Even after a loss.\nKing Arthur: Indeed.\nDavid: Well, we might as well get out of here. There's work to be done. And it's not here.\nKing Arthur: Good man. David, if you want to be part of something, do something that matters, I have a place for a man like you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Camelot camp.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSquire: I never saw a bean.\nDavid: Just forget the bean for now. Just tell us why you took these things.\nSquire: I was tired of how I was being treated... How we were all being treated. Breaking our backs for him, for love of Camelot. I wanted to hurt the king.\nKing Arthur: Grif, I had no idea. But, you see, you've hurt everyone. We need that bean to get home.\nSquire: I didn't see a bean, Your Majesty.\nKing Arthur: I'm always betrayed by those closest to me.\nDavid: Look, you know this guy. Is he lying?\nKing Arthur: I don't believe so. And of course, it is possible there was no bean if it was removed during the six weeks we can't recall.\nDavid: Okay, well, we'll find another way to get you home.\nKing Arthur: Working together?\nDavid: Absolutely.\n(Chuckles softly)\nDavid: Let's go tell this guy he's gonna make his home in our cell for a little while.\n(David finds the Crimson Cap toadstool under the tent.)\nDavid: What's this?\nKing Arthur: Must've fallen out when we emptied his bag. If that was in the trunk, it was added after the time we lost.\nDavid: I recognize this.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Ragina's Vault.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRegina: That's the one in the book from Camelot. The one I found this morning. That's what we were looking for back there.\nMary Margaret: But why?\nRegina: It's used to communicate through magical barriers. We must've been trying to communicate with Merlin.\nMary Margaret: I wonder if we did.\nDavid: Let's use it. Let's find out. If we can talk to him now...\nMary Margaret: He can help us save Emma from being the Dark One. David, you did it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Camelot. Six weeks ago. The Round Table.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Applause)\nKing Arthur: I dub thee Sir David of the Enchanted Forest. Now of the Round Table. I know \"Knight of the Round Table\" is pale fire, indeed, next to the title of prince.\nDavid: No. I am beyond honored.\nKing Arthur: Then rise, Sir Knight. Take your place.\n(David moves towards Percival's chair, but King Arthur clears throat and points to the Siege Perilous chair.)\n(Murmuring)\nDavid: Really?\nKing Arthur: I never thought I'd find anyone I trust enough to fill that seat. But it's yours. It will bear your coat of arms. Not bad for a shepherd, eh?\nDavid: (Chuckles) Thank you.\n(Applause)\n(Baby crying. Mary Margaret steps outside the room with Neal, and sees a shadow move.)\nMary Margaret: Someone there? Can't be.\nLancelot: It is.\nMary Margaret: Lancelot. We thought you were dead.\nLancelot: That is a long story. But trust your eyes... it is me. And right now, my struggles don't matter. What does is that there is a terrible villain in Camelot.\nMary Margaret: The Dark One. We know. It's our daughter. We're going to fix it.\nLancelot: No. There's another villain. Arthur.\nMary Margaret: What?\nLancelot: Trust me. Camelot is not what it seems.\n(Applause)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Camelot. Six weeks ago. The Round Table.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKing Arthur: Today was a difficult day.\nQueen Guinevere: You lied to him, to David.\nKing Arthur: And it brought me no pleasure. He's a good man. A noble man, but I must think of my kingdom first.\nQueen Guinevere: Of course you must.\n(Sighs)\nKing Arthur: That is always the burden of a king.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Sheriff's station.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSquire: Your Majesty, thank goodness you're here. I-I don't understand what's going on. I did only what you asked. I took the items, and I kept them safe. I said maybe there was a bean, even though you and I know full well there was never a bean, and I did it exactly as you said. Can you please let me out now?\nKing Arthur: Not just yet, Grif. There may not have been a bean, but we can't have them learning that, now, can we?\nSquire: No. No, of course not, Your Majesty.\nKing Arthur: They trust me now. So I must use that trust to protect my kingdom. These people may seem friendly, but they threaten everything we hold dear. David likes to imagine his quest a noble one. But his daughter is the Dark One. They lied to us in Camelot. They brought her into our castle. They are responsible for tearing us away from our home, a home we must now reclaim.\nSquire: But how will we ever get back without a bean?\nKing Arthur: I'm afraid we cannot get back. That's why we must build a new Camelot here in Storybrooke.\nSquire: Then you can trust me to help. I would do anything for my kingdom.\nKing Arthur: I know you would. As would I. Which is why I need you to drink this.\nSquire: Poison from the Agrabah vipers. But why? I won't tell these people a thing.\nKing Arthur: Not of your own free will, but they have magic on their side. In time, they will make you talk.\nSquire: There must be some other way.\nKing Arthur: I wish there was. Truly, I do. You told me you always dreamed of sitting at the round table one day. Well, now I'm offering you something greater. A chance to die in service of Camelot. Your death will be the cornerstone of a great new kingdom. If you take this.\nSquire: For Camelot.\n(Gagging)\nKing Arthur: For Camelot.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Granny's.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Bell jingles)\nHook: Good, you're still here.\nRobin Hood: You need me?\nHook: Yeah. Remember how I told you about that door in Emma's place? I want to know what's behind it.\nRobin Hood: I take it asking her didn't work.\nHook: She's beyond that. I need a thief.\nRobin Hood: Former thief. Those days are behind me.\nHook: Take it from a former pirate, those days are never behind you. Will you help me?\n(Bell jingles)\nBelle: Granny, have you got my lunch ready?\nGranny: Yeah, but, girl, you're gonna need more than that. Sit down for some real food.\nBelle: I can't. Oh, my god, look.\n(The last petal is on the stem.)\nBelle: Yeah, I have to get back to him. Just forget the soup. I'm sorry.\nGranny: Hang on, is it supposed to do that?\n(The rose petals start floating back into place.)\nBelle: What? He's waking up.\n(Plate shatters)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Gold's shop.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Belle finds Rumple's bed empty.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Emma's house. Basement.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(The darkness looks at Rumple.)\nDarkness: You know, he doesn't look too good... if I do say so myself. Quite a stroke of luck, you finding something that touched him when he was a man.\nEmma: It wasn't luck. I worked hard for this.\nDarkness: That's true. You crushed Hook's heart even more firmly under your, uh, impractical boot heel.\nEmma: Quiet.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present time. Gold's shop.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Belle watches as the rose becomes whole.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSCENE: Storybrooke. Present. Emma's house.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(Rumple breathes deeply and wakes up.)\nMr. Gold: What do you want from me? You are the Dark One now, not me.\nEmma: That's right. You are not dark. You are also not light. You are nothing. Your heart is a blank slate. And that, little man, makes you useful. Because now I can make you into the last thing you ever thought you would be. A hero. And not just any hero. The purest who's ever lived. and then...\n(Emma looks at the Darkness, who nods eagerly. Rumple looks confused at the empty space behind the Stone of Destiny.)\nEmma: and then I have a job for you.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",
        "logit_0": " The text is a summary of the events that led to the creation of the Dark One, the character who is the main antagonist in the television series Once Upon a Time. The text is set in the fictional world of Storybrooke, which is a place where fairy tale characters live. The text begins with the story of King Arthur and his knights, who are searching for the Holy Grail. They come across a mysterious stone that has the power to grant wishes. The stone is called the Stone of Destiny, and it is guarded by a creature called the Darkness. The Darkness is a powerful being who is able to manipulate people's minds and make them do its bidding. The Darkness is also able to take on different forms, and it takes the form of a rose in the story. The Darkness uses the Stone of Destiny to create the Dark One, a powerful being who is able to use magic and is the main antagonist in the series. The Dark One is created by using the Stone of Destiny to make a person's heart black and empty, which makes them susceptible to the Darkness's influence. The Dark One is then given the task of destroying the Holy Grail, which is a sacred object that is said to have the power to grant wishes"

Morgana says nothing. Sir Leon motions for the spare knights to search it and Morgana turns around.\nSir Leon: Lady Morgana. Morgana uses magic to throw each of the knights to the ground. She looks around, pulls off her hood and pulls back a blanket in the cart.\nMorgana: You're all right?\nMorgause: Yes, thank you, Sister. But we must hurry. Night is nearly upon us... Morgause turns her face towards Morgana, revealing a hideous deformity to the right side of her face.\nMorgause: ... And we still have far to go. --- New Opening Credits --- Castle Square Merlin runs through knights and servants and into the Castle. Servants are decorating the castle with vines and Merlin ducks under one of them as he bolts up the Griffin Stairway.\nMerlin: Sorry.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCastle Kitchens Merlin bumps into more servants and nicks some food off a passing plate. The head cook accosts him with a ladle.\nHead Cook: What are you doing in my kitchen?\nMerlin: Uh, the prince's shirt. The cook motions to the line above the stove where the pots are hanging.\nHead Cook: Keep your dirty fingers off my food, d'you understand? Merlin grabs the shirt and a hook on a string drops down in front of his face. He looks up, confused. Sir Gwaine and Sir Percival are peering down at him with eager and mischievous grins. Gwaine puts a finger to his lips and Merlin laughs. Merlin attaches the hook to one of the roasting chickens and pulls on the string. The knights pull it up to them as Merlin exits hastily.\nHead Cook: Oi!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCastle corridors Merlin weaves through bustling servants. A servant with wine pitchers bumps into him and spills it all over Arthur's newly washed shirt. Merlin picks up the stained shirt and stares at it.\nSir Lancelot: You could try a bit of salt.\nMerlin: Arthur is going to kill me.\nSir Lancelot: Let's see... Sir Lancelot looks at the shirt.\nSir Lancelot: ...You've faced far worse, Merlin.\nMerlin: He needs it for tonight.\nSir Lancelot: I'm sure a man of your talents can think of something. Lancelot lifts his eyebrows knowingly. Lancelot keeps walking and Merlin checks to see no one's looking.\nMerlin: *spell*Fordwin wamm! Lancelot stops and turns around. Merlin shows him the clean shirt and Lancelot opens his arms as if to say \"See, that was easy.\" The both continue on their way.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nArthur's chambers Arthur's leaning against his desk and writing, as Merlin enters with his clean white shirt.\nMerlin: You're dressed.\nArthur: Yes, Merlin. I'm not an idiot. Arthur turns around to walk behind his desk. He didn't manage to pull his shirt all the way through his belt in the back and his skin is showing. Merlin sniggers.\nMerlin: Are you sure about that?\nArthur: I beg your pardon?\nMerlin: It's just that...\nArthur: Merlin!\nMerlin: But you...\nArthur: I am trying to write a speech.\nMerlin: D' you want help?\nArthur: No.\nMerlin: You won't want this, then? Merlin holds up a scroll and Arthur looks up from his desk.\nMerlin: ... I spent all night working on it. Arthur takes the scroll and looks over it with exaggerated scepticism.\nMerlin: ... What do you think? Arthur hands it back to Merlin.\nArthur: It needs a polish.\nMerlin: I'll add it to the list. Arthur tosses the speech he was working on.\nArthur: Merlin, there aren't many servants who get the chance to write a prince's speech. Obviously it would be too much for you to say, \"Thank you.\" Merlin stares at Arthur for a moment and walks out with his laundry without deigning reply. Arthur smiles.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nSeas of Meredor Morgana helps Morgause limp out of the cart in the foggy wood.\nMorgause: The Isle of the Blessed. Morgana helps Morgause to the dock.

Gwen enters and watches him with a pitying expression before she approaches him.\nGwen: You've not eaten, Sire. Sire? Uther doesn't seem to hear her, lost in his own misery. Gwen takes the tray of untouched food and meets Gaius on her way out. She looks at the potion in Gaius's hand.\nGwen: It doesn't seem to make any difference.\nGaius: I'm not sure it ever will but at least it gives him peace.\nGwen: It's been a year since Morgana betrayed him.\nGaius: (nods) His heart is broken and his spirit is gone. Are you joining us for the feast tonight?\nGwen: I don't think so.

Sir Bertrand and Sir Wontague are both dead.\nArthur: Keep me informed of any developments. The councilmen exit. Agravaine remains.\nArthur: For months, nothing. Why now?\nAgravaine: We knew she couldn't stay hidden forever. Today, tomorrow, does it matter? We mustn't live in fear, Arthur. Camelot is strong. If Morgana were to act, we'd be ready for her.\nArthur: You're right, of course. I don't know how I'd've got through these last few months without you. Thank you, Uncle.\nAgravaine: I made a promise to your mother. I'll always be there for you.

We must hurry.\nMorgana: I can't do this.\nMorgause: Sister... Remember what I've told you. It is the only way. What you are about to do will affect everyone, even you.

Morgana takes the dagger.\nMorgause: I am not long for this world. There is nothing left for me here now. Morgause weakly climbs onto the altar stone and takes Morgana's hand.\nMorgause: Please, sister, let my parting be my final gift to you. Morgause lies down on the altar.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBanquet Hall Arthur raises his glass in a toast.\nArthur: To the king. Everyone stands to toast.\n[GONG CHIMES]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIsle of the Blessed - Altar\nMorgana: *spell*Eala leofu sweoster, paem gastum befaeste ic pe. Alys pa peoster pe inne onwunap. Morgana poises the dagger to strike, her eyes glow and she plunges it into Morgause's chest. Morgause gasps.\n[METAL STRIKES STONE]\nMorgause: Uh!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBanquet Hall Merlin senses the magic and everything goes into slow-mo. Image becomes fuzzy and voices are distorted.\nGaius: To the King!\nAgravaine: To the King! The knights toast their glasses as Merlin freaks out.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIsle of the Blessed - Altar Morgana is blown off her feet.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBanquet Hall Merlin sees a dead-looking woman in a black, hooded cloak with a staff standing in the middle of the banquet hall.\nThe Cailleach (whisper): Emrys. Emrys. Emrys.\n[JUG CLATTERS]\nMerlin drops his empty serving pitcher and the whole hall goes quiet and stares at him. He swoons. Lancelot rushes to his side. Arthur rolls his eyes. Merlin shivers on the floor.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIsle of the Blessed - Altar The Cailleach strokes Morgana's cheek and Morgana wakes. She sits up and sees the cloaked woman standing in front of the rift.\nMorgana: Who are you?\nThe Cailleach: I am the Cailleach, the gatekeeper to the Spirit World. You have torn the veil between the worlds.\n[SCREAMING]\nThe Cailleach: The Dorocha. They are the voices of the dead, my child, and, like the dead, they are numberless.\nMorgana looks around in fear.\nThe Cailleach: You are right to be afraid, Morgana. Your enemies will rue this day and all the destruction it brings, but you must be aware... Tearing the veil between the worlds has created a new world... and you will not walk through it alone. The one they call Emrys will walk in your shadow. He is your destiny... and he is your doom... Emrys.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMerlin's room Lancelot lays Merlin on the bed.\nSir Lancelot: What happened?\nGaius: I don't know. I've never felt anyone so cold before.\nSir Lancelot: Will he be all right?\nGaius: I'll need Hawthorne to improve the blood flow... and blankets... lots of blankets.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGaius's chambers Gaius is grinding something as Merlin steps out of his chamber wearing a blanket. They sit together.\nMerlin: When she spoke, her voice...it was as though it came from the depths of the Earth, and her eyes...they were so sad. So much pain in them. (He's shivering) Who is she?\nGaius: The Cailleach... the gatekeeper to the Spirit World.\nMerlin: Why is she there?\nGaius: It was on the stroke of midnight of Samhain's eve. The moment when the veil between the worlds is at its thinnest. It cannot be a coincidence.\nMerlin: Why was I the only one to see her?\nGaius: You have great power, Merlin. For someone so gifted, such visions are not uncommon.\nMerlin: But you don't understand. It wasn't a vision. She knew who I was. She called me Emrys. Gaius ponders.\nMerlin: What is it? What does it mean?\nGaius: I'm not sure. But if someone has torn the veil between the worlds, then God help us all.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nArthur's chambers (morning) Merlin brings in a breakfast tray and sets it noisily on the table while Arthur's still in bed.\nArthur: Merlin! Merlin opens the curtains, making a lot of noise.\nArthur: Merlin!\nMerlin: What?\n[KNOCK AT THE DOOR]\nArthur puts a pillow over his face. Someone knocks at the door.\nArthur: (muffled) Merlin!\nMerlin: That's not me. Arthur takes off the pillow and Sir Leon enters.\nSir Leon: Excuse me, Sire. You're needed in the Council Chambers as a matter of urgency.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCouncil Chamber\n[GIRL CRIES]\nThe Council is gathered around her.\nArthur: What's happened to her?\nAgravaine: Her village was attacked.\nArthur: By who?\nAgravaine: It's not entirely clear, Sire.\n[SOBBING CONTINUES]\nArthur: What's your name?\nDrea: Drea.\nArthur steps closer and the girl tenses. Arthur puts a comforting hand on her shoulder and speaks tenderly.\nArthur: Drea. She uncertainly makes eye contact.\nArthur: I'm Arthur. Don't be frightened. Tell me what happened.\nDrea: My mother, my father, my litter sister, they're... She starts weeping again.\nArthur: It's all right. It's all right... Someone attacked them. Drea nods.\nArthur: Who?\nDrea: There was no one... just...shapes.\nArthur: You didn't see their faces?\nDrea: They had no faces. Arthur looks uncertainly at a few councilmen. Merlin turns at the sound of something behind him. He seems to hear some kind of screeching.\nDrea: I... I keep telling you. They were there, but...they weren't there. They moved so quickly... It was as if they weren't real, but...they must've been. I could hear the people screaming. And then...silence. They were all...dead.\n[SHE SOBS]\nArthur: Hey. Thank you.\nArthur turns her to cry on Gaius's shoulder.\nArthur: Where is this village?\nAgravaine: Hawden. to the east of the White Mountains, no more than half a day's hard ride.\nArthur: Ready the men.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nForest The Round Table Knights ride out of Camelot. Merlin is startled by the sound of a woodpecker.\nArthur: Merlin... you need your comfort blanket?\nMerlin: What do you mean?\nArthur: You're making ME edgy. [HORSE WHINNIES] Merlin jumps.\nArthur: That's a horse.\nMerlin: Maybe it sensed something.\nArthur: Yes, that you're a clot pole.\nMerlin: That's my word.\nArthur: Yeah, and it suits you perfectly. The knights look at a deserted village from the top of a hill.\nArthur: It's too quiet.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the village (night) They enter the village on foot, night has fallen. All is silent. A door creaks loudly and they freeze until a goat bleats and wanders out. They split up in pairs to search. [CRUNCHING] They all jump.\nSir Gwaine: Sorry.\nSir Elyan: Here! Gwaine drops the apple and they all run to Elyan. Inside one of the houses, they stare at frosted corpses. They all turn as something whips past behind them.\nArthur: You saw it?\nSir Gwaine: We are literally chasing shadows.\nArthur: Come on. They exit the house and search the village at night, bearing torches.\n[DISTANT WAILS]\nMerlin splits off from Lancelot when he hears a door shut in a barn. [RUSTLING] He walks around cautiously [SQUAWKING], a chicken jumps out at him. He sighs in relief. Something shrieks quietly behind him and he sees a wisp of it as it exits the barn. Merlin chases the shrieking wisp and loses it. [DISTANT SCREECHING] [GROWLING] Screaming is getting louder.\nMerlin: *spell* Leoht! Merlin shines a light from his hand. The light fades.\nMerlin: *spell* Leoht! Leoht The light shines briefly and disappears.\nMerlin: Leoht Nothing happens. Screams echo around him. A wisp shoots straight for him.\nMerlin: *spell* Fleoh nu on moras! Merlin's eyes glow, but nothing happens.\nSir Lancelot: Merlin! Lancelot uses his torch to repel the wisp.\nSir Lancelot: What happened?\nMerlin: (tears in the eyes) My magic...I couldn't use it. The others come running.\nSir Lancelot: There's something out there!\nArthur: You saw it?\nSir Lancelot: When it saw the light, it fled.\nSir Gwaine: It scared the horses.\nMerlin: It's not something you can chase or something you can kill.\nArthur: We need to get out of here.\n[DISTANT WAILING]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCastle Square (night)\n[BELL RINGS]\nPeople are screaming and running into the Castle. Gwen rushes down a hallway with blankets and a torch.\nAgravaine: Gwen! Warn Gaius there are more victims by the western gate. Agravaine continues down another hallway and Gwen rushes on until a window behind her smashes in right behind a knight. The skull wisp rushes in and the knight screams. Gwen takes cover behind a column and brandishes her torch at the skull wisp. The skull wisp leaves and she crouches to check on the knight. He's frozen solid.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMorgue Guards exit with a stretcher and Gaius pulls a cloth over the face of one of many victims.\nMerlin: Gaius.\nGaius: Merlin...You saw them. Merlin nods.\nGaius: Here, help me. Give me some more sheets. Merlin's still acting strangely.\nGaius: Merlin?\nMerlin: My magic is useless against them. I've tried. I have never felt so powerless. Something deep inside... When it came for me, I felt this emptiness. I couldn't breathe... I'm scared.\nGaius: Merlin, it's all right. It's not your fault.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAgravaine's chambers (morning)\nAgravaine: We've suffered fifty dead, maybe more. Mainly in the Lower Town.\nArthur: And there's no way of fighting them?\nAgravaine: No, our only weapons are torches. And the light doesn't kill them, it only repels them.\nArthur: What are they?\nGaius: The Dorocha, Sire. The Spirits of the dead. On Samhain's eve in the time of the Old Religion, the high priestesses would perform a blood sacrifice and release them.\nAgravaine: But who would do such a thing now?\nGaius: Morgana.\nArthur: You see her hand in this?\nGaius: We know she was travelling to the Isle of the Blessed.\nArthur: How do we defeat these creatures?\nGaius: I don't know, Sire. No mortal has ever survived their touch.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nArthur's chambers (night) Merlin lights candles.\n[CREAKING]\nHe drops his basket of candles; one rolls near the curtains. Arthur looks up.\nMerlin: I thought I saw something.\nArthur: What was it, a spider? Merlin sees the curtain move and stares at the candle on the floor. Arthur watches Merlin's hesitation. They both look at the candle on the floor.\nArthur: Just pick it up. Merlin doesn't move, they both stare at the curtain.\nArthur: Do you want me to get one of the maids to do it for you?\nMerlin: It's not a joke.\nArthur: Yeah. Arthur approaches the curtain, uses his sword to whip it open. Nothing's there. Merlin sighs in relief.\nArthur: You see, Merlin, I could never be like you. I could never let myself look so spineless.\nMerlin: Oh, you see I'm different. I could never let myself look heartless.\nArthur: What?\nMerlin: All right. Thoughtless.\nArthur: Never.\nMerlin: Definitely humourless.\nArthur: That's because you're not funny. Arthur hands Merlin the candle.\n[SCREAMING]\nMerlin: You're not scared?\nArthur: Oh, I am, Merlin. Maybe more than you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCamelot (night) The guards light fires in grates all over the city. The Dorocha sweeps past some candles in the Gaius's Chambers and blows out some of them. Gaius snaps up from his work.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the lower town. Knights patrol the streets with torches. Sir Percival lags behind when he sees/hears something. He walks over to some barrels and finds three small children huddling behind them.\nSir Percival: Hey, hey, hey. It's all right. It's all right, you're safe now. Percival hears the Dorocha and checks to see the knights walking in the distance. Percival leaves the torch and runs through the street with the children in his arms. The Dorocha streaks right for them and Elyan jumps in with a torch just in time. Elyan takes one of the kids and they bring them to their parents in a house.\nSir Percival: Thanks.\nSir Elyan: Couldn't let you have all the glory, could I? They grin at each other.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCastle square (morning) The square is packed with refugees carrying their belongings. There is a huge line of people waiting to get some help.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCouncil Chamber\nGaius: They're coming from across the kingdom. They're looking to Camelot for protection.\nArthur: And we will give it to them.\nAgravaine: We cannot house them all.\nArthur: We have to try.\nAgravaine: How? We cannot live like this forever, Arthur. We must find a way to vanquish these creatures.\nArthur: Somewhere in all your books, Gaius, there must be something. All I'm asking for is a way to fight them.\nGaius: I fear the Dorocha cannot be defeated by swords and arrows, Sire. If I am right, and the veil between the worlds is torn, then there's only one path open to us... To travel to the Isle of the Blessed and repair it.\nArthur: And how do I do that?\nGaius: I'm not sure. But for the tear to be created it would have required a blood sacrifice. To seal it... will require another.\nArthur: We ride before nightfall.\nGaius: And who will be the sacrifice?\nArthur: If laying down my life will spare the people of Camelot, then that is what I must do.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nForest Agravaine rides through the woods.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMorgana's cave Agravaine enters without knocking. She puts a dagger to his back.\nAgravaine: My lady?\nMorgana: My lord... I trust you bring me good news. She lowers the dagger and walks further into her home.\nMorgana: Tell me.\nAgravaine: The kingdom is on its knees.\nMorgana: How terrible.\nAgravaine: (chuckles) Indeed.\nMorgana: What of the poor people?\nAgravaine: More fall every night.\nMorgana: Such a shame.\nAgravaine: You should know that Arthur intends to vanquish these creatures.\nMorgana: (scoffs) Impossible.\nAgravaine: He makes ready to go to the Isle of the Blessed as we speak. And if the Dorocha don't kill him on the way, our brave little lamb intends to sacrifice himself to repair the veil. Morgana thinks it over and turns away.\nAgravaine: Something's troubling you... Morgana!\nMorgana: Something the Cailleach said. She spoke of someone called Emrys. Called him my doom.\nAgravaine: Your doom? What did she mean?\nMorgana: I don't know.\nAgravaine: Morgana, we should be celebrating. Arthur will be dead within the week, leaving the throne open for Camelot's rightful heir. Morgana smirks.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nUther's chambers Arthur sits by his father.\nArthur: There are many things I have to thank you for. You've taught me so much. Most of all, you have taught me what it is to be a prince. I hope that this time you'll be proud of me. Arthur cries as Gwen walks in the doorway. Arthur stands up, cups his father's chin and kisses his forehead. Arthur turns to leave and Uther grabs his arm.\nUther: Don't leave me.\nArthur: I have to, Father.\nUther: Please. Arthur squeezes his father's hand, then wipes his tears and leaves. He sees Gwen and goes to her.\nArthur: Promise me you'll look after him when I'm gone.\nGwen: What is it? Arthur doesn't respond.\nGwen: ... You don't have to go.\nArthur: I do.\nGwen: Please, Arthur, take care. You are precious, not just the kingdom.\nArthur: Smile.\nGwen: I can't.\nArthur: D'you remember...the first time I kissed you? She smiles.\nArthur: There. That's the memory I want to take with me. They embrace. Gwen holds him tight.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOutside, the Knights are getting ready to leave. They walk their horses out of the castle in slow-mo.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAgravaine's chambers Arthur hands Agravaine a ring bearing the Pendragon seal.\nArthur: You have to take this. It bears the royal seal. In my absence, responsibility to the kingdom rests with you.\nAgravain: What about your father?\nArthur: Should he die, you are to assume the throne.\nAgravaine: Arthur...\nArthur: You're the only person I trust, Uncle.\nAgravaine: I beg you, for the sake of the kingdom, there must be another way. Agravaine presses the ring back into Arthur's hand.\nArthur: My mind is made up. I'm just grateful you're here. Arthur leaves Agravaine with the ring.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMerlin's room Gaius enters while Merlin is packing.\nGaius: Merlin. What're you doing?\nMerlin: It's my destiny to protect Arthur.\nGaius: How? Your magic is powerless against the Dorocha.\nMerlin: Then I must sacrifice myself in his place.\nGaius: No.\nMerlin: My life has always been marked out by destiny. If this is meant to be...I'm not afraid. I will gladly die, Gaius, knowing that one day...Albion will live. Gaius hugs Merlin.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOutside the castle Lancelot watches Gwen walking to him. He smiles.\nSir Lancelot: Gwen.\nGwen: Will you grant me a favour?\nSir Lancelot: Anything. Gwen looks over at Arthur exiting the city gate with Merlin.\nGwen: Look after him. Bring him home. Lancelot looks disappointed.\nSir Lancelot: I will protect him with my life. You have my promise.\nGwen: Thank you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe forest The knights ride out. After dismounting, they prepare to make camp.\nArthur: Elyan, look after the horses, they need watering. I need someone to volunteer to get wood.\nMerlin: I'll do that. Lancelot watches Merlin go and follows.\nSir Lancelot: You shouldn't be here. You have no powers.\nMerlin: Doesn't matter.\nSir Lancelot: You're not a warrior, Merlin. I don't want to see you hurt. If you leave in the morning, I'll cover with Arthur.\nMerlin: It's your duty to protect Camelot no matter what the cost... Well, it's my duty to protect Arthur. Surely you can understand that.\nSir Lancelot: I can understand that very well.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMorgana's cave Morgana is dreaming. Red and black banners lie strewn on a battlefield with knights' corpses. A raven sitting on a helmet takes flight. Excalibur is stuck in the ground (or in a knight's chest) Emrys walks on the field with a white cane.\nMorgana: Help me, Emrys. Please. Morgana's wrinkled hand reaches up to Old Merlin from her position on the ground.\nMerlin: Is this really what you wanted, Morgana?\nMorgana: Please... Morgana wakes in her bed. At first she seems afraid, then angry.\nMorgana: Emrys.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe knights ride by a field littered with peasants corpses.\nArthur: We need to reach Daelbeth by nightfall. The knights pick up the pace.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRuined fortress (dusk)\nArthur: Pair off. Find any wood you can. Get the fires burning. The knights collect firewood while carrying torches. Gwaine hears a man's scream and drops his firewood. The nights gather together as screams start to surround them. The Dorocha launches at them and Arthur wards it off with a torch.\nArthur: Let's go!\nSir Percival: We haven't got enough!\nArthur: Go! The knights are back at the fire pit with Merlin and Lancelot. Merlin pretends to use the flint.\nMerlin: (whisper)*spell* Bel onbryne. The fire lights instantly. Lancelot looks at him. Merlin makes a cute shrug face. Lancelot grins in amusement. The knights stand around the fire with torches. Percival looks at the fire, then at Arthur.\nSir Percival: It won't get us through the night.\nArthur: It'll keep the area safe for a while. Later, Gwaine throws a log on the fire.\nSir Gwaine: The last one. Maybe we should draw lots, see who gets some more.\nArthur: I'll go.\nSir Lancelot: You'll need help.\nMerlin: I'll go with him.\nArthur: You sure you're the right person?\nMerlin: Well, since when have you known how to collect firewood? The knights chuckle. Lancelot watches as they walk off. Merlin collects firewood while Arthur stands guard with a torch. The Dorocha charges them from behind.\nArthur: Merlin! Arthur drops the torch to tackle Merlin out of the way. They fall off the wall.\nArthur: Let's go! They rush through some passages and close a door behind them. The Dorocha seems to lose them. The knights back at the fire pit shuffle around anxiously.\nSir Lancelot: They should have been back by now.\nSir Elyan: Someone needs to go and look for them.\nSir Percival: We've only one torch between us. Lancelot grabs the torch and starts walking off.\nSir Lancelot: Who's coming? Elyan follows, then the other knights. Gwaine grabs his sword belt and puts it on as he follows. Arthur and Merlin hide behind a corner in one of the fortress rooms. Merlin ties a cloth around Arthur's injured arm. They are shivering.\nArthur: It's cold.\nMerlin: Right.\nArthur: You're not feeling it?\nMerlin: I... Merlin shrugs his shoulders and shakes his head.\nArthur: You know, Merlin, you're braver than I give you credit for.\nMerlin: Really? Was that a compliment?\nArthur: Don't be stupid. Merlin chuckles and then Arthur does, too. Back in the passages, Lancelot leads the knights through the fortress, warding off the Dorocha with the torch. Back in the hiding chamber, Merlin and Arthur listen to the screaming spirits.\nArthur: Of all the things I've faced...I never worried about dying.\nMerlin: I don't think you should now.\nArthur: Sometimes you puzzle me.\nMerlin: You never fathomed me out.\nArthur: No.\nMerlin: I always thought if things had been different, we'd've been good friends.\nArthur: Yeah.\nMerlin: That's if you hadn't been such an arrogant, pompous, dollop head. Arthur chuckles.\nMerlin: We will defeat the Dorocha. We will, Arthur, together.\nArthur: Well, I appreciate that. You know, you're a brave man, Merlin... between battles. Merlin chuckles.\nMerlin: You don't know how many times I've saved your life.\nArthur: If I ever become king, I'm going to have you made court jester! They chuckle. Then they hear the Dorocha. In the passages, Lancelot and the knights continue the search. Back in the hiding chamber, Merlin and Arthur wait.\nArthur: They say the darkest hour is just before the dawn.\nMerlin: Feels pretty dark now.\nArthur: It can't be long.\n[SCREECHING]\nThe Dorocha finds them and sweeps through the door. Arthur starts to rush out from around the corner, but Merlin pulls him back and stands up himself, running straight for the Dorocha.\nArthur: Merlin, no!\n[SCREECHING]\nMerlin jumps at the Dorocha. It catches him in the chest, stops him mid-air and throws him back against the stone wall. Lancelot enters and wards off the Dorocha with the torch, then hands it to Percival and turns to Arthur.\nSir Lancelot: What happened? Arthur and Lancelot go to Merlin. They turn him over, his face is covered with frost.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Dr. Albert's wrong.\nDale : Then somebody better change Baldwin's rules between now and the final.\nRusty : Dr. Albert is not infallible, Dale.\nDale : If you define \"infallible\" as I do in this situation as in \"holds my future in her hands,\" then yes, she is. What you looking at? Dr. Albert? Did she hear you say she wasn't infallible? Please, Lord, grant me invisibility...\nRusty : No. It's the girl from my American lit class. Just don't stare so much.\nDale : That girl right there? I hate to say this, but I liked it better when you weren't on the prowl.\nRusty : That's the Moby Dick girl.\nDale : I'm not real sure I'm comfortable with that statement either.\nRusty : Last week, in my American lit class, Mr. Ellman pointed to me and he's like, \"Mr. Cartwright,\" and I said, \"No, please call me Ishmael.\"\nBoth : Emma cracked up.\nDale : It's such a good story. Every time.\nRusty : She got the joke. I think she gets me. You know how rare that is?\nDale : No, not really. But what I do know is that obsessing, particularly in the carnal realm, distracts the mind from important matters, like solid-state chemistry.\nRusty : My work in solid-state chemistry is not suffering because of Emma.\nDale : Well, mine is. If you like this girl, for heaven's sake, and mine, just ask her out.\nRusty : She laughed at my joke, she didn't give me her phone number. Look how she closes her book first, and then takes her last sip of coffee. Dale ? No !\nDale : She'll meet you for coffee tonight at the espresso farm, don't thank me. Let's start with exo-digs, you take favored, I'll take unfavored. You wanna sit down or you wanna just keep standing here? Come on. ZBZ HOUSE - Living room\nFrannie : What's going on?\nCasey : Caroline, Laurie, and Amy have been invited to Lambda Sig pink rose formal.\nFrannie : It's fantastic.\nAshleigh : We're finally moving out of the social dog house. Under the amazing leadership of Casey Cartwright.\nFrannie : So when do we call the Omega Chis? To build on the momentum? The Lambda Sigs are the second hottest house on campus. Now that they've officially taken us off Greek death row with these invitations, this is the perfect time to push for a full pardon by setting up a mixer with the first hottest house... the Omega Chis. If you thought that was a good idea.\nCasey : Actually, I think it's a... terrible idea.\nZBZ Girl : But the Omega Chis are a rightful social counterpart.\nCasey : Rightful social counterpart B.J.K.\nAshleigh : \"Before Jen K.\"\nCasey : And the shunning Omega Chi gave us after the article was published? Not to mention B.P.H.\nAshleigh : Before... Paris Hilton?\nCasey : Before public humiliation? The back-to-school carnival. Am I the only one who remembers the kissing booth debacle? The way the Omega Chis publicly humiliated us? Why should we reward them for treating us like that? No, ladies. ZBZs will find their way to the top on their own merits. And in the meantime... We can celebrate, and strengthen from within. How about a game night? We can order pizza, bake cookies...\nFrannie : Great, that sounds great. It sounds great. Credits CRU - Dale & Rusty's room\nRusty : 7:00, 8:00.? 7:00 sounds great. No. That's fine. Yeah, all right. I'll see you then. All right, bye. She wants to bring her roommate along on our date.\nDale : That can't be a good sign.\nRusty : If she didn't want to be alone with me, why didn't she just break the date?\nDale : Pity can be a pretty powerful emotion. Or... She likes you so much already, she wants to show you off.\nRusty : All right, maybe I should bring somebody to... To keep her roommate busy. So I can have a little one-on-one time with Emma.\nDale : That's à good idea. Maybe get one of your frat bros to go along.\nRusty : No, I don't wanna have to explain how this whole stupid date thing happened to any of the guys at the fraternity. Especially if it's go up in flames. How about you go with me? You're the one who got me into this.\nDale : Rusty, I know you haven't been able to see me in action. You know, pure girls being somewhat in short supply here at CRU. I'm known in certain circles as quite the ladies' man. I wouldn't wanna show you out there.\nRusty : What circles are those?\nDale : Purity pledge circles. I was voted \"most likely to have the opportunity to become impure, but have the supreme self-control not to\" three years running in high school. I just don't want to risk our friendship over some girl.\nRusty : I'm willing to take the risk.\nDale : All right, then. If that's the way you want it, roomie. But be forewarned. I have no control over this charisma. ZBZ HOUSE - Hallway\nRebecca : That sounds terrible. Poor thing! So I'll call you later. That was Cappie. He's sick.\nCasey : Yeah, I'm suddenly feeling a little nauseous myself.\nRebecca : Not having a boyfriend is nothing to get yourself upset about. You don't need a man to have a fulfilling life. You could be the next mother Teresa or Rosie O'Donnell. Caroline and Mandy have already left for the movies yet?\nCasey : Wait, you're not going to see Cappie?\nRebecca : He's sick.\nCasey : Really? OK. I saw Mandy...\nRebecca : What?\nCasey : It's just... When Cappie and I were together, I always took care of him when he was sick. But... He's probably not even thinking about that right now. Maybe you can just send him a nice warm e-card. I'm sure it'd mean a lot to him. CRU - Garden\nAshleigh : Okay, I'm here. So what's with all the secrecy?\nFrannie : We needed to talk somewhere away from the house. I'm worried about Casey.\nAshleigh : Frannie, I know you've supposedly gone through this whole personality overhaul thing, but I'm kind of weirded out when you start talking about your concern for Casey.\nFrannie : This is not about me. Didn't you notice how everyone was looking at her when she nixed mixing with the Omega Chis? And I know you heard someone call her \"Lizzi.\"\nAshleigh : So? Casey, Lizzi. It's an understandable mistake.\nFrannie : Casey is seriously being blinded to what's good for the house and herself by this Evan-shaped mental block. Which I know I helped to put there. That's why I'm doing everything I can to get everyone back to their rightful places.\nAshleigh : If you feel so strongly about this, why don't you talk to Casey about it?\nFrannie : Because she might be kind of weirded out. Don't let her blow this opportunity, Ash. ZBZ HOUSE - Ashleigh & Casey's room\nCasey : Not wanting to have a mixer with the Omega Chis couldn't possibly have anything to do with my feelings for Evan. I don't have feelings for Evan. It doesn't matter to me if he's arrogant, or rude, or dismissive... I don't even notice.\nAshleigh : Yeah, I can see that. Did you know that Amanda gets PE credits for massaging the varsity boys during swim meets? We should just go...\nCasey : The Omega Chis publicly humiliated the ZBZs at the back-to-school carnival. Right?\nAshleigh : From where I was standing, Case, it looked more like... Evan humiliated you. But I could be so wrong.\nCasey : No, Ash. You're right. It was about Evan and me. But he is an Omega Chi and I am a ZBZ.\nAshleigh : Yes, you are. And you're the best president ever.\nCasey : And there are 50 other girls in this sorority, who didn't get dissed and who want to resume relations with the Omega Chis.\nAshleigh : 50 hot, desirable Omega Chis, including Calvin, who might be waiting for an opportunity to disagree with Evan Chambers.\nCasey : That part would be gratifying.\nAshleigh : I'm social chair. I can extend the invitation.\nCasey : Thanks Ash, but this isn't just about the party. It's about normalizing relations. I need to do it. I can do it.\nAshleigh : Wanna go fondle some swimmers first?\nCasey : You are such a good friend. CRU - Café\nEmma : So how did you meet?\nRusty : Did you guys meet here? You can go first.\nEmma : No, you first.\nDale : Luck of the draw. Housing office saw fit to put us two brainiacs on the engineering dorm.\nRusty : Dale, we don't need...\nDale : Honors floor. I got a 2210 on my sats. Rusty here got about the same.\nTina : I got 2250.\nDale : 780 in math. Tina 790.\nRusty : Dale's very proud of his accomplishments.\nEmma : It's okay. Tina's not easily intimidated.\nRusty : I see that.\nEmma : So how are you liking american lit?\nRusty : Honestly, I am finding Moby Dick a little long and kinda stiff. I can't believe I just said that.\nEmma : I say things I don't mean to say all the time. Why do you think I don't talk in class?\nRusty : Well, I just figured you were so far ahead of the discussion, you were just waiting for the rest of the class to catch up.\nEmma : I wish. Mostly I'm just trying to stay awake. Which I guess brings us back to Moby Dick being...\nRusty : A little long and stiff.\nTina : Is that what I think it is?\nRusty : What, what is?\nDale : His pledge pin? Or his scarlet letter, if you will? He's in a frat.\nRusty : We prefer \"fraternity.\" I'm pledging Kappa Tau Gamma.\nTina : The Greek system should be banned from college campuses.\nDale : You got a 2250 on your sats, and you're down on the Greeks?\nEmma : Well, the Greeks aren't so bad.\nTina : Emma, they're this totally ritualistic, secretive society.\nRusty : I think you may be taking it a little bit too seriously.\nTina : You don't think it's serious when an organization takes monies from general students services fees, but doesn't allow all students to participate in its activities?\nRusty : Well, the same could be said for most clubs on campus and sports teams.\nEmma : I could use some more coffee.\nRusty : I can get that for you.\nDale : You know, I've started an organization you may be interested in, U-Sag.\nTina : U- sag? What does that stand for?\nDale : University students against Greeks. CRU - Street\nRusty : That was a complete disaster.\nDale : Are you kidding? That was great. That Tina's a real spitfire.\nRusty : Dale, this was supposed to be my date with the new girl, and it turned into the Greek inquisition. They didn't even want us to walk them back to their dorms.\nEmma : Hey Rusty !\nDale : If Tina wants to call me, tell her it's okay. I'm serious.\nEmma : I just wanted to apologize for abandoning you tonight. I'm not much good with confrontation.\nRusty : Your roommate likes it enough for both of you.\nEmma : I know. I probably shouldn't have brought her. I didn't really know you, and anyway, I'm really sorry. See you in class?\nRusty : Maybe we can try it again? Just you and me? Friday night?\nEmma : Sure. Why not?\nDale : Did you tell her to call me? OMEGA CHI HOUSE - Hallway\nEvan : Casey ?\nCasey : Hey!\nEvan : Hey!\nCasey : I was looking for Dino.\nEvan : Dino?\nCasey : The Omega Chi president?\nEvan : Yeah, I know. I know who he is. He's not here right now. What did you want to talk to him about?\nCasey : Just some Greek business. If that's okay with you.\nEvan : Why wouldn't it be with me? Just that the OCs and the ZBZs aren't exactly doing business anymore. But if you want me to tell Dino you stopped by, I'll tell him.\nCasey : You know what? Never mind. I don't have to talk to him after all. KT HOUSE - Cappie's room\nRebecca : Cap ?\nCappie : That's my girl ?\nRebecca : Hey ? Thought maybe you could use a massage or maybe a sponge... I thought you had a cold.\nCappie : I do. I also have pink eye.\nRebecca : Bummer. Well, there's some tea. I've gotta go.\nCappie : Wait. What's under the white coat, doc?\nRebecca : It's... nothing that should be seen through... Crust.\nCappie : Is it really that bad? Okay, hold on. Here we go. Better?\nRebecca : A little. What?\nCappie : I didn't think that you'd come.\nRebecca : Why not? Casey took care of you when you were sick, right?\nCappie : Well, yeah, but, I mean, you're not... Tea! What is this, Earl Grey?\nRebecca : It's chamomile. Is there anything else I can do for you?\nCappie : I don't wanna impose. Let's see. Would you mind... Heating that up? Yeah, it's just a little cold. Thanks. And maybe some Chicken noodle soup in a cup, in, like, the mug, you know? It's always better when it's in a mug for when you're sick. With some of the little oyster crackers on top. I'm sorry. It's probably a good thing you wore the coat. ZBZ HOUSE - Living room\nAshleigh : So the social committee is planning a game night, and I'm taking a poll on board games.\nFrannie : More like boring games.\nZBZ Girl : What we should be planning is a great party with the Omega Chis.\nCasey : I couldn't agree more. Which is why I went to the Omega Chi house just now to discuss the possibility of mixing with us.\nFrannie : My God, that's fantastic.\nCasey : But they said no.\nAshleigh : Really?\nFrannie : Did you talk to Dino?\nCasey : We're still poison as far as they're concerned. But who cares, right? We don't need the Omega Chis to be the best sority at CRU. We are the ZBZs. We have the Lambda Sigs. We have game night. Now I'm gonna go change my clothes. And then let's scatter some gories.\nAshleigh : She did what she could. I guess. CRU - Dale & Rusty's room\nRusty : CD, cD jacket. Think I'm set.\nDale : Were you able to include any \"Darwin lied\"?\nRusty : I tried, Dale, but damnation seems like a little bit of a romance killer.\nDale : You know what Emma's gonna like, anyway?\nRusty : I don't, which is why I emailed her a detailed questionnaire with multiple options in each musical category. She hasn't sent it back, though, so I thought I'd give her some choices that she can cross-reference while deciding.\nDale : Man, that's my third email from Tina today. She's really chompin'at the U-Sag bit. I think she's gonna come by our meeting tomorrow.\nRusty : I don't get the attraction. Tina's one of the most abrasive people I've ever met.\nDale : I'm just not intimidated by strong women. And U-Sag is a big tent organization. CRU - Café\nAshleigh : Oh Calvin ! Over here.\nCalvin : Let me just go grab some coffee.\nAshleigh : No! Sit.\nCalvin : Or... not.\nAshleigh : Why don't we have mixers anymore?\nCalvin : \"We\" meaning \"you and I\"?\nAshleigh : \"We\" meaning ZBZ and Omega Chi. You guys totally shut down the idea of having a mixer with us? What's up with that?\nCalvin : I still have no idea what you're talking about.\nAshleigh : Casey said that she got a seriously strong negative reaction from Dino when she invited you guys to mix with us.\nCalvin : Really? That's weird. When it comes to getting back together with the ZBZs, my sense is most of the guys are fine with it, including Dino.\nAshleigh : I need you to do something for me.\nCalvin : Okay, let me just grab...\nAshleigh : No. So this is what I need you to do. CRU - Emma & Tina's door\nRusty : \"Indelible.\" Crap.\nGirl : See you at dinner, Tina.\nRusty : Hey Tina.\nTina : What are you doing with our white board?\nRusty : I just came by to drop off a CD for Emma, and it just fell off. And I thought I would just take it back to my dorm room, slap some adhesive on it, and bring it back.\nTina : It fell?\nRusty : Crazy? Good thing I was here. And I have adhesive in my room, so... I'm gonna go.\nTina : I can't speak for Emma, but I really don't appreciate being part of these little frat pranks. Give me back my white board.\nRusty : This has nothing to do with the fraternity.\nTina : Then give it back. Don't you think it would have been simpler to just erase it?\nRusty : Yes, but... Okay, I used their marker, and it's indelible. Who knew?\nTina : Yeah, they're in the middle of this feud with these guys down the hall. Hey, if you could find one with a corkboard, that'd be great.\nRusty : Hey, can you just give this to Emma for me?\nTina : Any message? Something... Short and limp?\nRusty : Just say it's from Rusty. Here. OMEGA CHI HOUSE - Meeting room\nCalvin : All right. Look, we all know the ZBZs have been looked down upon ever since the article. But it's old news. I think it's time we gave them a second chance. They're the same girls that we partied with last semester, and they're awesome. I just don't think we should keep punishing them for something that could have happened to any of us.\nEvan : I think my little brother is well-intentioned, but, in this particular case, missguided. I mean, come on, guys. The events of the past few months have just shown us who they really are. I mean, they're a house... That... Always puts their own interests first, and ultimately can't be trusted. I mean, no matter how much we might wanna trust them.\nDino : Do you really believe that?\nEvan : Look, if this is about having a mixer, the Tri Pis are always available.\nCalvin : A little too available.\nDino : Why don't we put it to a vote? All those in favor of continuing to shut out the ZBZs? All those opposed. ZBZs have it. ZBZ HOUSE - Ashleigh & Casey's room\nCasey : What, did they just announce a new season of \"America's Next Top Model\"?\nAshleigh : Better! Kyle, the Omega Chi social chair, just came by to invite the Zeta betas to mix with them this weekend.\nCasey : Wow, that's... That's so not what they said before. But great.\nAshleigh : We're gonna have to scramble a little to get the registration forms and keg application into the dean's office in time. But where there's a will, there's a way to get through with the new party restrictions. Right?\nCasey : Right. We're back on with the Omega Chis. I wonder how all of this happened.\nAshleigh : Case, did you ever actually talk to Dino about a mixer?\nCasey : Why would you even ask me that?\nAshleigh : 'cause I talked to Calvin. And from what he was hearing at the house, it didn't sound like you had.\nCasey : Let's go see that... That was really fun. Right? I really meant to. I wanted to. I went over there, and Evan answered the door, and he was all cold and judgey. I knew what I should say, but I couldn't talk. I couldn't give him the satisfaction of knowing I wanted anything from him.\nAshleigh : It's one night. One night that'll make two houses very happy. And all you have to do is sign our half of the registration forms and get through a few hours with Evan. And I have a plan for that. CRU - Dale & Rusty's room\nRusty : Hey, guys. Emma loved the CD. I just got a text from her. \"T-h-x\" with an exclamation point.\nSanjay : A bake sale?\nTed : Car washes?\nDale : Just keep reading. So I guess she wasn't phased by the white board incident.\nRusty : I told you, Dale, she gets me. I just want to give her a couple more song choices before class.\nSanjay : This is truly ambitious.\nRusty : What are you guys doing?\nDale : We're meeting with Tina later that afternoon about U-Sag. I just want the guys here to be up to speed on all our suggestions.\nRusty : That's a lot of suggestions.\nDale : Tina's a real dynamo. And I feel like, you know, it's my job now to harness all her energy.\nSanjay : That sounds dirty.\nTed : You think everything sounds dirty.\nDale : Guys, could we focus?\nTina : Dale? You ready?\nDale : Come in. Hey. Let me introduce you to Sanjay and Ted.\nSanjay : Hi.\nTed : Hi.\nTina : Sanjay, Ted. Ishmael. So are you guys ready to go? I had a bunch of posters made up.\nDale : Posters? But, I mean, we haven't really went over...\nTina : We gotta grow this thing. I've got a hammer, and the rest of you guys could just use your shoes. Come on, guys, let's go! Hurry up!\nRusty : Nice harnessing. Got extra shoes? KT HOUSE - Living room\nRebecca : Anybody know where the charger to Cappie's little video game machine is?\nHeath : Nope.\nRebecca : I don't suppose you have any saltine crackers. Anybody?\nKT Guy : How 'bout some peanuts? They're warm.\nRebecca : Works for me! Okay. I will pay anyone $200 to take this tray up to Cappie's room and watch Reba with him. We're on season five!\nHeath : No one goes into Cappie's room when he's sick.\nKT Guy : It's like going into the Bermuda Triangle. With germs.\nHeath : The only one brave enough to do that was...\nRebecca : Casey. I know.\nKT Guy : I hear she never left his side.\nHeath : Yeah, she was a real angel of mercy. CRU - Classroom\nRusty : Hey...\nEmma : Hey!\nRusty : I also brought you a set of push pins. Because, look, it's got a corkboard on it. And a new set of dry erase pens. 'cause you don't want any more accidents.\nEmma : No, that's for sure. Thanks.\nRusty : And I got you a cup of coffee. Careful. And a full selection of additives.\nEmma : Wow.\nRusty : Last, but not least, here is a few more song samples, an updated hard copy of the cd questionnaire. I figured, since you hadn't responded, you were having trouble downloading the attachment.\nEmma : Rusty, this is amazing. The only bad thing is now I feel like a real jerk for having to postpone our date tonight.\nRusty : Oh.\nEmma : I have a paper due on Monday for my philosophy class. And I... Thought I'd be a lot further along than I am. So now I have to work on it all weekend. I'm really sorry.\nRusty : That's okay. When you're dating a student, you have to expect these kinds of things, right?\nEmma : Right.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOMEGA CHI HOUSE - Party\nAshleigh : There, now you only have to come in contact with Evan once. When you check his ID. And stamp his hand. Or his face.\nCasey : Ash !\nAshleigh : Like you wouldn't love to.\nRebecca : Nice to see the Greek world back on its axis.\nCasey : How's Cappie? Contagious?\nRebecca : Probably. Whatever.\nCasey : Enjoy your soda.\nRebecca : Thanks, Casey.\nCasey : This night not be so bad after all.\nAshleigh : There's Calvin. Are you okay here?\nCasey : Sure, I'm fine. Have fun.\nAshleigh : Thanks.\nCasey : Hey, Evan Let me just stamp your hand and then you can go get started.\nEvan : You're ZBZ party patrol?\nCasey : Your guy hasn't shown up yet.\nEvan : Actually, he has. It's me. OMEGA CHI HOUSE - Party\nFrannie : Oh, my God. Is this a reunion of... More than just our houses? Or just an incredibly awkward coincidence?\nEvan : You're holding up the line, Frannie.\nAshleigh : Do you think people can really change?\nCalvin : Right now, I'm more concerned about having something that combustible so close to the alcohol.\nAshleigh : I think they're gonna be okay. Let's go mingle.\nEvan : If you stamp that hard, it makes the ink wet. If the ink stays wet, it's easier for them to transfer stamps.\nCasey : If you guys had invested in wristbands instead of stamps, we wouldn't have to worry about it. Have fun.\nEvan : You didn't check her ID.\nCasey : She's over 21. I've known her for two years.\nEvan : It doesn't matter. You still have to check her ID.\nCasey : Right. I guess knowing someone for two years doesn't mean that much in the end.\nZBZ Girl : I'm over 21, Casey.\nCasey : Beer is high in carbs and it makes you bloat. I'm doing you a favor.\nEvan : I guess you always gotta make me be the bad guy. So you can play the victim again. Man up, Condon.\nCasey : Whatever role I play, I have to be a mime, since you never stop accusing long enough to let me get a word in.\nEvan : You mean you think you have some... Some reasonable explanation for kissing Cappie after I lavaliered you?\nCasey : How about that I'm human? That I make mistakes? Like you did when you rush-humped Rebecca.\nEvan : Will you ever quit playing that card? I was never in love with Rebecca.\nCasey : You... move! Move! Just move! So?\nAshleigh : Can I get re-stamped?\nEvan : Listen, it wasn't the same level of betrayal, okay? You obviously still had feelings for Cappie.\nCasey : And I still have feelings for Cappie, Evan. Just like I still have feelings for you. Maybe I always will. Unlike the super-human Evan Chambers, I don't seem to have control over how I feel about people. Most of the time however, I do have control over what I do about those feelings. And what I did was choose you. I thought that was the most important thing. Clearly, in your world, it isn't. And then you dumped me without trying to talk, without giving me the second chance I gave you.\nEvan : O'Toole. Perfect. You're gonna have to do this, man, you're it. I need a drink. KT HOUSE - Cappie's room\nCappie : Dr. Logan. You're... A scary scandinavian woman.\nNurse : It's nurse Von Lembke. But you can call me Helga.\nCappie : Why would I wanna do that?\nNurse : Rebecca Logan sent me. She said it's time for you to get well. Shall we start with the nasal irrigation? CRU - Dale & Rusty's room\nRusty : Emma must be really working hard. She's not even answering her phone. I just hope she got that care package I sent her.\nDale : Could you keep your voice down, please?\nRusty : Why?\nDale : 'cause Tina said she was coming over, and I do not want to talk to her. And put your phone on vibrate.\nRusty : Whatever happened to \"Not being intimidated by strong women\", \"Harnessing that dynamo\"?\nDale : She's trying to take over U-Sag. She emails me at least a dozen times a day. She put her email on all the flyers. Now she's even got Ted and Sanjay including a prayer for a greater U-Sag profile on campus in their daily intercessions.\nRusty : Well, Dale, you just can't hide out here. You're eventually going to have to talk to her.\nDale : No, I won't.\nRusty : Are you just gonna will her away?\nDale : I believe in science and creationism. My mind is a powerful instrument.\nTina : Hello? It's Tina. Anybody in there?\nDale : Don't say anything.\nTina : Is that you, Dale? I'm actually here to see Rusty.\nDale : It's a ruse. Don't fall for it. Do not let her in.\nRusty : Don't be ridiculous, Dale.\nTina : What's going on in there?\nRusty : What's going on in there is that Dale wants U-Sag back.\nTina : What are you talking about?\nRusty : You... overstepping your boundaries. As much as I disagree with U-Sag, it's important to Dale. It's his brainchild. You took a simple invitation to join, and you ran wild with it.\nTina : I thought that the goal was to get rid of the Greek system.\nRusty : It is, unfortunately. But... Dale wants to do it his way. And you had no right to come in and pull the rug out from under him. The guy's freaked out. So you just need to back off.\nTina : Yeah, well, I didn't come here to talk about U-Sag anyway. I came here to give you this. It's from Emma. Your care package. I mean, between the cd and the white board and the coffee and the questionnaire, and now this... I mean, you're scaring her. She wants you to back off. OMEGA CHI HOUSE - Party\nEvan : Frannie... What do you want?\nFrannie : To apologize. For screwing things up with you and Casey last semester.\nEvan : I don't even wanna think about me and Casey anymore.\nFrannie : Or maybe I can help. Evan kisses Frannie.\nFrannie : My... Not exactly what I had in mind.\nEvan : Really?\nFrannie : Look, Evan... You're a gorgeous guy, with many, many fine attributes. You're also... Clearly Still working out some issues. I'm not interested in being anyone's warm body.\nEvan : I got it. ZBZ HOUSE - Ashleigh & Casey's room Casey just woke up. OMEGA CHI HOUSE - Living room\nCalvin : Evan.\nEvan : I need my shoes. Where are my shoes?\nCalvin : Right there.\nEvan : Yes, okay.\nCalvin : You look like crap. Where are you going?\nEvan : I'm gonna go tell Casey I'm an idiot, and I want her back.\nCalvin : Good luck with that. OMEGA CHI HOUSE - Hallway\nEvan : Casey. You look amazing.\nCasey : I feel pretty amazing. I'm done, Evan.\nEvan : Done with what?\nCasey : With all this. I'm finished being angry with you. I woke up this morning and I finally realized no matter what I say or do, I can't change the past. Or how you feel about it. And I'm done trying. I'm finally ready to move on.\nEvan : Move on... From us?\nCasey : Yeah.\nEvan : And what if I was less of a jealous idiot?\nCasey : Then I'd think maybe we could be friends... If you think you can do that.\nEvan : Friends?\nCasey : Think about it. See ya around campus... Evan Chambers. CRU - Street\nRusty : Hey, you're up early.\nEmma : I've got coffee, thanks.\nRusty : This one's mine. Look, Emma... I just want to apologize for coming on so strong. I never meant to scare you or seem like a crazy person.\nEmma : That's okay.\nRusty : Yeah, I guess I'm just... Overly enthusiastic. I really liked you. And I really liked being in a relationship when I was in one before. And I guess when it... Seemed like I might have a shot at a new one, I kind of jumped the gun. I'm sorry for the firearms metaphors.\nEmma : Don't worry about it.\nRusty : Yeah, I don't know. It's probably obvious that... I don't have a lot of experience in the romance department. But I'm a fast learner. And maybe if I totally put the brakes on, we can try again.\nEmma : Yeah. No. But I'll see you in class, okay? ZBZ HOUSE - Hallway\nCasey : Frannie.\nFrannie : Casey.\nCasey : We need to talk.\nFrannie : About what?\nCasey : Do you still wanna move back into the house?\nFrannie : Yeah.\nCasey : Then do it. You're officially off probation. We're moving forward. KT HOUSE - Cappie's room\nCappie : Good morning.\nRebecca : What did you do to him?\nNurse : You know the rules, Ms. Logan. What happens in Cappie's room stays in Cappie's room.\nRebecca : Still contagious, right?\nCappie : No, I was just wearing this because, apparently, Helga likes pirates.\nRebecca : You two...\nCappie : Did not. I am currently a one-woman man.\nRebecca : Look, Cappie... I am not now, nor will I ever be Casey Cartwright... Perfect girlfriend, angel of mercy.\nCappie : Well, thank God.\nRebecca : You really are a colossal pain in the ass when you're sick, you know that? I don't know how she stood you.\nCappie : Well, she is an angel. And she discovered my achilles heel. Cough syrup. Knocks me on my butt. She'd give me a dose, climb out the window, and come back by the time I need another one. No one knew. She didn't even think I knew. What?\nRebecca : Only makes me like her more.\nCappie : Really? We talkin' threesome now?\nRebecca : Who said you're invited?\nCappie : You're bad. You naughty little girl. CRU - Dale & Rusty's room\nTina : I had a new idea for a U-Sag flyer, and I just wanted to run it by Dale and see if he would sign off on it.\nRusty : I'll make sure he gets it.\nTina : Hey Rusty. For what it's worth, Emma likes her crazy on the outside, not the inside. You're the first guy she's gone out with all semester that's not covered in tattoos and body piercings.\nRusty : I'm not crazy, okay?\nTina : And I'm not an egomaniacal control freak. Look... you probably won't understand this, and I don't even know why I feel the need to explain it to you, but I like to be in things. And all the ramp-up, getting-to-know-you part makes me feel anxious. So I kind of sort of just jump over it. Which can make me seem a little... pushy. Okay? Well, you better watch out for us, frat boy. Go, U-Sag!\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

You think you've got problems ? (Scoffs). What, did your man dump you ?\nMAGGIE : Sorry, love, are you talking to me ? It's just, you know, I'm a bit busy right now. I'm not really interested in listen... (She stops when she sees his bullet wound in his chest). What is that ?\nOWEN : I got shot.\nMAGGIE : Yeah, right. He looks at her, half smiles and nods. She sticks her finger in his bullet wound. Now, she's freaking.\nMAGGIE : Oh, my God. She climbs down from her perch on the wall and steps back just to put some distance between them.\nMAGGIE : What the hell are you ? Owen climbs down off the wall. Maggie is still backing away from him.\nOWEN : I'm dead.\nMAGGIE : That's not... Look, you can't be dead, you're... you're standing here. You're talking. You're moving. You're... you're not dead. Wha... ? You're... You're dead ?\nOWEN : Yeah, I was brought back... like Jesus really, but without the beard, you know. (Realizes). sh1t, I'm never gonna have a beard. Not that I wanted one you understand, but you know, one day I...\nMAGGIE : Yeah. Okay. Okay. You're dead and that's... that's clearly a bit sh1t and I'm sorry and everything but, if you are dead, then why are you here ? You can't be wanting to jump. You can't die twice.\nOWEN : Sorry, are you an expert ?\nMAGGIE : Sorry, are you an idiot ?\nOWEN : Yeah. I'm a dead idiot.\nMAGGIE : So, come on then, what's it like ? She sticks a cigarette in her mouth and lights it.\nOWEN : What ?\nMAGGIE : Well, being dead. What delights have I got to look forward to ?\nOWEN : Darkness. Nothing.\nMAGGIE : Cheery, thanks. Look, why are you here ? Owen looks at her.\nJACK (PRE-LAP, v.o.) : Dr. Owen Harper, Torchwood Officer 565, I'm relieving you of your position.\nINT. THE HUB - JACK'S OFFICE - NIGHT (EARLIER)\nJack is at his desk as he delivers the bad news to Owen. Ianto is near the doorway.\nOWEN : Bollocks. I'm sorry, Jack, this is bollocks !\nJACK : Hand in your weapon and your security pass.\nOWEN : But why ? I'm fine.\nJACK : Three days ago, you died. We need to examine you. We need to find out what you are. We need to be certain you're okay.\nOWEN : Yeah, well it almost sounds as if you care, well done.\nJACK : Until I'm confident you're fit for duty, Martha Jones will replace you as Torchwood's new medical officer.\nOWEN : She's doing all right out of this, isn't she ?\nJACK (stands up) : She's worked out a series of tests and examinations.\nOWEN : And what if I refuse ?\nJACK : You'll be confined to the cells, the tests will be done, and if the results show that you're a danger to the team, appropriate steps will be taken. Ianto steps in closer. Jack also steps in closer to Owen.\nJACK : I'm asking you, Owen. Please, let us help you. Let us make sure you're safe. Owen doesn't look at him.\nIANTO : I'm gonna need your gun. Owen turns and looks at him. He takes his gun out and reluctantly gives it to Ianto.\nIANTO : And your security pass. (Owen looks at Ianto). Please... Just behind them and through the glass in the wall, Martha is in the workstations. He glances at her, then takes his security pass out and gives it to Ianto.\nOWEN : And how long are Dr. Jones' tests going to take ?\nJACK : As long as they need to.\nOWEN : And what the hell am I supposed to do in the meantime ?\nJACK : We always need someone to make coffee.\nOWEN : Oh, no.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCLOSE-UP : COFFEE MACHINE\nIanto is at his area at the base of the spiral stairs as he fills up the coffee cup. Owen sits in the chair nearby.\nIANTO : Voila. Fresh and strong. (He smells it appreciatively). Mmmm. Owen gets up. Ianto steps aside and hands the cup to Owen.\nOWEN : And, uh... we couldn't just have a jar of instant, no ?\nIANTO : I thought you liked your coffee.\nOWEN : Have you seen what happens when I drink these days ?\nIANTO : Yeah. Thank you, Owen. Ianto takes the cup away from him.\nIANTO : Do you want a go ?\nOWEN : Ooh, please. Owen turns to try his hand at the machine. Owen grabs the handle. The cups rattle as he tries to get it to work, but it doesn't.\nOWEN : Come on. What's wrong with this ?\nIANTO : You, um... Owen grabs both handles and shakes it. The cups and dishes rattle loudly. Some sound as if they break. He turns and sees Jack and Martha on the stairs watching him. He rests his chin on the machine in humiliation.\nIANTO (quietly) : You okay ? OWEN (sighs and turns around) : What do you think ? I bet you're loving this, aren't you ? It's like you've finally won.\nIANTO : I didn't realize we were in competition.\nOWEN : Oh, come on ! Even Tosh had more of a life than you used to. And now you're always out on missions, you're shagging Jack and I'm stuck here making the coffee.\nIANTO : It's not like that. Me and Jack. Ianto goes to the machine and fixes a cup of coffee.\nOWEN : Yeah, yeah... You and Jack. Gwen's getting married. Martha's got her bloke. God, even Tosh had Tommy. This is really sh1t ! Ianto goes about his business.\nIANTO : We've all gone through sh1t. I've seen you dissect alien corpses. I've seen you save so many lives. Are you really going to let this beat you ? He leaves Owen with that.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. THE HUB - AUTOPSY AREA\nOwen is on the treadmill. His image is up on the monitor as Martha tests him. The machine beeps. Owen stops it. He smiles.\nOWEN : So, you're choosing me over the boyfriend ? Owen steps off the treadmill and picks up the barbells. He starts lifting them. Martha goes to the treadmill to check the readings.\nMARTHA : Yeah, that's it. You really don't need to worry, you know, I don't want your job.\nOWEN : Yes, I know. You just find me irresistible.\nMARTHA (rolls her eyes) : Oh, yeah, that's it. Every morning I wake up and think of ways to get you alone like this. (She goes back to the computer). There is no sign of any muscle decay. You're in great shape, as ever.\nOWEN : Hmm, no use coming onto me, Jones. I'm a changed man.\nMARTHA : And... um, no stiffening anywhere ?\nOWEN : Well...\nMARTHA : Just answer the question.\nOWEN : No, no signs of rigor mortis. Owen puts the barbells down.\nOWEN : So, if I keep up the exercise, I won't atrophy ? She appears with the hand-held monitor and scans him.\nMARTHA : Yep. And bonus, definitely looks like you're not going to age either. There's no further sign of cell mutation. You're a hundred percent human. (She turns the monitor off). A hundred percent Owen. Owen nods. The intercom beeps.\nGWEN (from speaker) : Hi, Martha. Meeting in the boardroom. Can you come down ?\nOWEN : You'd better go... Doctor.\nMARTHA : What about you ?\nOWEN : Cappuccino with chocolate sprinkles.\nMARTHA (smiles, confused) : What ?\nOWEN : That's what you drink, isn't it ? Suddenly, it's very awkward. Martha turns and leaves. Owen's smile fades.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. THE HUB - CONFERENCE ROOM\nEveryone except Owen is there.\nJACK : Henry John Parker. He used to be a looker. Now he's 80-odd and even I have my limits. The door opens. Owen walks in with a tray of coffee.\nJACK : Your basic millionaire collector of alien hoo-hah.\nOWEN (quietly) : Didn't we file him in the \"mostly harmless\" category ? He puts a cup down in front of Ianto.\nMARTHA : So, what's the problem ? Owen continues setting coffee cups down on the table.\nTOSHIKO : I detected this at 5:17 this morning. Parker's house. There's an energy spike coming from it. I've never seen anything like it before.\nGWEN : Okay. So, the big question is, what's our Mr. Parker gone and found this time ? Gwen and Ianto quietly switch coffee cups as Owen heads to the back of the room.\nMARTHA : Why ? Do you think he's a threat ?\nGWEN : Well, he hasn't been up until now. (Owen wipes his tray as he listens). He's a bit Howard Hughes. We know he's there, we know he's not a threat. But as the story goes, he hasn't left the house since his wife died. Nobody's seen him since 1986.\nOWEN : We've been monitoring Parker for ages. There's nothing to be scared of is there ? Owen quickly sits down at the table with the others. There's a brief awkwardness with him being there when he's not supposed to.\nIANTO : Unlike, say, Tintin ?\nOWEN : Okay ! I never liked Tintin. What ? He's weird. He's got a funny face and his hair is just, he's horrible.\nIANTO : I always loved Tintin.\nOWEN : Yeah, well you would. And he never had a girlfriend did he, just the dog. Yeah, so I reckon he was actually shagging the dog.\nGWEN (interrupts) : Okay, meanwhile, back at Torchwood. Alien energy pulse. (to Jack) We've got to check this Parker out, okay ? (Jack nods. Gwen gets to her feet). Tosh, can you get me a complete schematic of the house ? Ianto, find out exactly what he's got. Get me an inventory of everything that he's bought over the last ten years. Martha, can you get a hold of his medical history ?\nMARTHA : Sure.\nGWEN : Okay, let's get to it, guys. As everyone gets to their feet, Jack levels a look at Owen. He then gets to his feet to leave as well. Owen is left sitting at the table.\nJACK (o.s.) : Hey, Gwen, any news on Banana Boat ?\nGWEN : Can you believe it ? Best Man, arrested in Lanzarote.\nJACK : What for ?\nGWEN : Ah, dodgy Cds.\nOWEN (PRE-LAP v.o.) : Worldwide, nearly a million people kill themselves each year. The door closes behind them.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT (PRESENT)\nOWEN : That's almost three times the population of Cardiff. Makes you think.\nMAGGIE : What are you ? Some sort of suicide geek ?\nOWEN : No, just a doctor. In fact, I'm not just a doctor. I'm a bloody brilliant doctor.\nMARTHA (PRE-LAP, v.o.) : I know you are.\nINT. THE HUB - AUTOPSY AREA (EARLIER)\nOwen sits on the table while Martha is working on the computer.\nOWEN : So why are you doing my job ? He absently plays with a scalpel, flipping it and catching it. Martha turns to look at him.\nMARTHA : Because Gwen asked me to.\nOWEN : That's not what I mean.\nMARTHA : Because you died. And because you need help. That's not a bad thing. Well, it's a bad thing that you died obviously, but it's not bad that you need help. If you know what I mean.\nOWEN : You're kinda cute when you babble.\nMARTHA : And you're kinda cute when you're not chucking a scalpel about.\nOWEN : But I'm making the sodding coffee ! (He stands up. Martha goes back to typing on the computer). I mean, come on, won't your bloke be missing you ? How about Jack ! Has he seen Jack ? They always get jealous when they meet Jack.\nMARTHA (irritated) : Owen, I don't want your job. I just want to do mine.\nOWEN : Okay, I'm dead, but I am one hundred percent human. I'm fine.\nMARTHA : You've sliced your hand open. Owen drops the scalpel as he opens his hand. It clatters on the floor. He is sufficiently freaked. TIME CUT TO : Owen sits on the table as Martha tends to his hand.\nMARTHA : The wound's not going to heal, so, you're going to have to re-stitch it every week or so. At least you don't need anesthetic.\nOWEN : Yeah, can't feel anything. I can't feel the needle or thread. I can't feel your hands on mine. Yet, I can touch things. I can hold 'em, I know they're there. But I just... can't feel anything. I'm numb.\nMARTHA : Do you see why Jack's worried ? Bruises won't heal. Bones won't mend. You're... fragile. Owen takes a breath.\nOWEN : Yeah, well, I'd better get used to doing things myself. He takes the needle and thread from her to stitch up his own hand.\nMAGGIE (PRE-LAP, v.o.) : So she offers to help you and you push her away ? Charming.\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT (PRESENT)\nMaggie takes another cigarette out of the box.\nOWEN : Yeah, hole in the chest. Sorry if I don't follow social niceties any more. Owen climbs up on the wall to take his seat next to her.\nMAGGIE : You mean you did before ? She lights the cigarette.\nOWEN : God, you're a pain in the arse, aren't you ? Is that why your man dumped you ? (She looks at him). Ooh, I hit a nerve ? What, did you get your heart broken ?\nMAGGIE : No, actually. He died.\nOWEN : I'm sorry.\nMAGGIE : No you're not. You couldn't care less about me and I don't care about you. Just because we're both planning on jumping, it doesn't mean we have some sort of special connection.\nOWEN : You don't know the half of it.\nINT. THE HUB - WORKSTATIONS / JACK'S OFFICE (EARLIER)\nGwen is at her workstation going through some papers. Owen walks up to her and puts her cup down. His hand is bandaged up. She glances at him.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOwen talks with Jack.\nOWEN : Give me something to do.\nJACK : You know I can't. Rules and regulations. Owen takes Jack's cup and plate.\nOWEN : Fine. I might as well go home then.\nJACK : Okay. Owen turns toward the door. He turns back.\nOWEN : What exactly do I do when I get there ?\nJACK : Watch TV... chill.\nOWEN : Jack, I'm dead. I'm permanently chilled. You know, you get to live forever. I get to die forever. It's funny that. Owen turns and leaves.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. OWEN'S PLACE - DAY\nOwen is back at home, sitting on the sofa with the television set on.\nMAN 1 (from tv) : I'll look into it myself.\nMAN 2 (from tv) : Can I arrange something for later ?\nRANDOM MAN (from tv) : Yep.\nHOST (from tv) : Oh, hello ! And welcome to To Buy Or Not To Buy, the property show that lets you indulge in your... Owen turns the sound off. He sits on the sofa for a moment, puts the remote down and rubs his eyes. He gets up and looks at his place. He picks up a large trash bag, walks over to the refrigerator, turns the iPod on and opens the refrigerator. He clears out the food inside.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the bathroom, he throws away the toilet tissue. He opens the medicine cabinet and tosses all the shaving and grooming products on the bottom shelf. CUT BACK TO : Owen clears off the items on the refrigerator door. CUT BACK TO : In the bathroom, Owen tosses all the products on the top shelf in the medicine cabinet.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOwen takes the garbage bag and closes the refrigerator door. He picks up the brand new loaf of bread on the table and looks at it. He tosses it in the garbage bag. He then throws away all the food on the table. He throws away the food on the counter, including a bowl of fresh fruit... and a handful of rotting bananas. He stops.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOwen is back to sitting on the couch.\nVARIOUS CUTS OF OWEN BEING BORED\nHe stands in the bathroom. He looks at his empty refrigerator.) More Owen being bored. His eyes drift shut. Suddenly, his doorbell is ringing. It takes him a moment to realize that his doorbell is ringing. Owen opens the door and finds Toshiko there. She smiles at him.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nToshiko bursts in. She's carrying a box of pizza.\nTOSHIKO : Do you mind if I eat, I'm starving ? She heads into the kitchen.\nOWEN : No, help yourself. So, Jack asked you to come round did he ? \"Talk to Owen. Get him to open up, goddamn it\". He sits at the counter.\nTOSHIKO : You haven't changed, have you ? It's all about Owen. (She grabs her bottle of drink and looks around). I've had a hell of a morning, you know. Do you have a... ? She motions opening the bottle.\nOWEN (points) : Top drawer. She turns to get the bottle opener.\nTOSHIKO : So, Jack calls me in at 5:00 this morning. (She opens the bottle). He could've waited until I got in, but no, strange energy spike, and it's \"Let's get Tosh in.\" Oh, and when Gwen got in, first thing she did ? Say sorry for not asking me to be bridesmaid. (voice fades) I mean, me, a bridesmaid ? Toshiko eats and continues talking. Owen drowns her out, not paying attention to her.\nMAGGIE (v.o.) : You sound like an old married couple.\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - PRESENT\nOwen and Maggie talk.\nMAGGIE : Brian used to say I talked too much.\nOWEN : Tell me about him.\nMAGGIE : Today's my wedding anniversary.\nQuick flashes of : Maggie exiting the church in her white wedding dress. She and her husband leave.\nMAGGIE (whispers) : My perfect day...\nQuick flashes of : Maggie is walking along the road, her white dress drenched red with blood. She staggers, then sits on the side of the grassy hill.\nMAGGIE : It was an accident.\nQuick flash of : Maggie in her blood-stained wedding dress. She heads toward the overturned car. She sits on the grass and touches her dead husband's hand. She looks around for help.\nMAGGIE : We'd been married less than an hour.\nQuick flash of : Maggie climbs up the grassy hill to the road. Her face is cut. She makes her way along the empty road.\nMAGGIE : I was picking confetti out of my hair when it happens.\nOWEN : sh1t. I'm...\nMAGGIE : Sorry, yeah. I know.\nOWEN : You've waited until your wedding anniversary to kill yourself ? Why ?\nMAGGIE : Does it matter ?\nOWEN : Why have you waited ?\nMAGGIE : Because I believe people. I... I believe them when they said it would get better. So, what do you think, Doctor ? Do you... do you really think it's going to get any better ? They lapse into silence. Maggie inhales from her cigarette, then tosses it off the side of the building.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. OWEN'S PLACE - DAY (EARLIER)\nOwen is in his kitchen, staring at nothing. He closes his eyes. PAN slowly around Owen to REVEAL that Toshiko is still there and talking. We can't hear a word she's saying as Owen has tuned her out. Owen's brows furrow as something occurs to him. We hear Toshiko's voice now, mid-conversation.\nTOSHIKO (fades in) : ... bounced a message from the stars. Guess what... It's Croatian. I ran it through the language translator and it's flipping Croatian.\nOWEN (interrupts) : Why are you here, Tosh ?\nTOSHIKO : I want to help you. He nods.\nOWEN : And how are you going to do that ? How are you going to help me ? I mean, am I going to be a new special project ?\nTOSHIKO : Come on, Owen, I just...\nOWEN : That's not why you're here is it ? For some reason you want me. You know I don't know why, but you always have... always looking at me, watching me screw all those other women, your heart breaking and now it's different. Because I'm safe now, aren't I ? And it's all cozy and it's romantic and isn't it beautiful ?\nTOSHIKO : You can say what you like. I'm not leaving you.\nOWEN : Of course, not. This is it, isn't it ? This is the date that we were talking babout. You've got your beer, you've got pizza, you and me. It's just how you wanted it. All we need now is a sodding pool table.\nTOSHIKO : Stop it ! What's wrong with you ?\nOWEN : I'm broken, Tosh ! I don't work. I've got no heartbeat, no feelings, no tears ! I have got nothing to give you ! I... Do you understand that ? Maybe that's what you want ! Maybe you want somebody who's as screwed up as you ! Who's twisted and screwed up like you are. (He holds up his bandaged right hand). You want to see broken ? (He grabs his pinky finger). Do you want to see broken, Tosh ? He bends it backward till the bones crack.\nTOSHIKO : Owen ! Stop it ! What are you doing ?! He bends it all the way back. Toshiko stares at him. Owen sees the look on her face and can't take it any more. He runs out. The door slams shut behind him.\nEXT. OUTSIDE - DAY\nOwen runs... across the green grass... and past people watching. He runs as fast as he can. Owen turns and runs along the wooden pier. He runs to the end of the pier... and jumps into the water. Owen plunges into the water. He closes his eyes and all the bubbles clear. He opens his eyes and drifts in the water.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOwen puts a hand on the wooden pier and pulls himself up. He rests there a moment. Jack steps up to him and checks his wristband.\nJACK : Thirty-six minutes. Not bad.\nOWEN : You were watching ?\nJACK : Skinny guy in tight jeans runs into water ? I was taking pictures. Jack starts walking away. Owen quickly gets up. He's dripping. Jack stops and turns around.\nJACK : How long is this going to go on for, Owen ? Jack turns and walks away from him.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. THE HUB - CONFERENCE ROOM\nGwen leads the meeting with Jack, Ianto and Martha sitting at the table.\nGWEN : Ianto, what have you found out about Parker ?\nIANTO : I've identified some of the things he's purchased over the past year. We've got a Dogon eye. A pair of Myakian wings, some meteorites. An Arcateenian translation of James Herbert's The Fog. But there are a few things we've never seen before.\nGWEN : So one of these is causing the energy spikes ?\nIANTO : Looks like it. And they're getting bigger, dangerously bigger.\nGWEN : Well, okay we need to get in there. Gwen reaches across the table to hand Ianto a file. Ianto stands and leans over the table to get it.\nGWEN : Parker employs a Mr. Philip Farrington to run security. There's at least six guards, CCTV everywhere, all of which we can bring down by taking out the generator. But then there's these... (they turn to look at the monitor) heat sensors.\nMARTHA : As in body heat ?\nGWEN : Yep. Solar-powered. There's one on every doorway, every window.\nIANTO : So, how do we get past them ?\nOWEN (o.s.) : Sounds like you need a dead man. They turn and find Owen standing in the doorway, a towel draped around his neck, his hair still damp. His pinky finger is bandaged up as well.\nOWEN : Someone with no body heat. He walks into the room.\nOWEN : What have you got to lose ? He looks at Jack. Jack looks at him, measuring him. He motions to Ianto. Ianto offers Owen his gun back. Owen takes it. Jack nods. Footsteps approach. It's Toshiko. Owen turns around.\nOWEN : Tosh ? She offers his keys back to him.\nTOSHIKO : I turned your telly off. She leaves the keys with him and she walks away.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT (PRESENT)\nMaggie and Owen talk. Maggie sits on the roof wall, her back to the edge as she faces Owen.\nMAGGIE : You screamed at her, you said all those things, and that's it ?\nOWEN : That's Tosh. Always the professional. She hops off the roof wall.\nMAGGIE : I don't care. I'm not interested in you, in old men or, or alien meteors. I came here because my husband died. I just want to jump. Owen looks at her and nods. Suddenly, he grabs her and rushes toward the edge of the roof.\nOWEN : Let's get on with it !\nMAGGIE (shouts) : Get off me ! He lets her go.\nOWEN : You, you're too scared.\nMAGGIE : Aren't you ? (Owen doesn't answer her). How did... how did you get from that to here ? The sirens wail below. She looks at him.\nMAGGIE : What happened ?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. OUTSIDE PARKER RESIDENCE - NIGHT (EARLIER)\nMartha talks with Owen. Jack watches behind her with the monitors they've set up. Owen is wearing a jacket with the hood over his head.\nMARTHA : If you hurt yourself, you will not recover. Like I said... any bruises you get, they're not going to heal. Do not engage in physical combat... one punch you're gone. Be careful.\nOWEN : I understand, I'm made of glass. Owen turns to head out.\nMARTHA : Owen ? He stops and looks at her.\nMARTHA : Just take care. He nods, then turns to head out when Jack stops him.\nJACK : Oh, and... uh ... you'll need this. Jack tosses a white cloth to him. Owen looks at Jack. Owen nods, then turns to go. He runs down the path along the bushes.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTOP VIEW DOWN on the estate pool. A security guard walks along the edge of the pool. PULL BACK to show the large wall bordering the estate and Owen making his way on the outside of the wall. Owen stops outside the gate and looks in. He presses his back to the stone wall.\nTOSHIKO (from comm) : Owen ? Owen turns his comm on.\nOWEN (quietly to comm) : Yeah... Hi, Tosh.\nTOSHIKO (from comm) : Okay, the power in the house is supplied from one private electrical generator. There's a backup unit but take the main one down and you've got one minute, twenty of blackout time. The security guard walks past the gate.\nOWEN : Can you get rid of one of the blokes here ?\nIANTO : It might look a bit suspicious if there were two phone calls.\nOWEN : Try and make it the big one, okay ? The two guards circle around the pool in a routine manner. Something shrieks in the night. One of the guards turns and looks. A cell phone rings. The guard turns and looks at the other guard. Owen also turns and quickly glances at the guard nearest the gate whose phone is ringing. The smaller guard answers his phone.\nOWEN (quiet) : Arse. BEN TAYLOR (GUARD) (to phone) : Hello ? INTERCUT WITH :\nINT. THE HUB - WORKSTATIONS\nGwen is on the speakerphone.\nGWEN (to phone) : Mr. Taylor ?\nBEN TAYLOR (to phone) : Yeah, that's right. Who's this ?\nGWEN (to phone) : I'm calling from St. Helen's Hospital. Mrs. Christine Taylor was brought in an hour ago. She's been involved in a car accident. The other guard approaches Ben Taylor.\nBEN TAYLOR (to phone) : Is she hurt ?\nGWEN : She's going to be fine, but she's asking to see you.\nBEN TAYLOR : Of course, I'm on my way. He hangs up.\nGUARD 2 : You all right ?\nBEN TAYLOR : It's Chrissie, she's been in an accident. Look, I've got to go.\nGUARD 2 : Yeah, of course. Ben leaves. Owen quickly moves to the other side of the gate. The remaining guard looksaround.\nGUARD 2 (to radio) : Mr. Farrington ? Ben's had to go. His wife's been in an accident. The guard walks out of the pool area through the gate. He passes Owen without seeing him. Owen runs in through the gate, passes the pool and quickly up the lawn. Owen makes his way cautiously along the wall of the greenhouse building. He reaches the main lawn and stops for a moment, then continues toward the electrical box.\nOWEN (quietly, to comm) : Okay, guys, I'm here. He opens the electrical box. The hinges squeak. A guard walks up to him from behind.\nGUARD : Move away from there. Startled, Owen turns around to find the guard walking up to him.\nGUARD (grabs Owen) : I said ! Owen kicks the guard. The guard falls to the ground. Owen takes out the white cloth Jack gave him. He looks at it and sees it's a t-shirt complete with toon boy and dog : Tintin.\nOWEN (groans) : Yeah, okay, guys. Very funny. Owen wraps the shirt around his hand just as the guard starts to get up.\nGUARD : Argh ! Owen pulls his gun out and the guard stops.\nOWEN : No, no, no. Do you want to see what I can do ?\nGUARD : What ? Owen turns and sticks his shirt-wrapped hand in the electrical box and shorts it out. The lights in the house flash. Owen grins.\nOWEN : Woo ! Owen pulls out the main cable. The power goes out completely.\nOWEN : I'm dead already, mate.\nFARRINGTON (over radio) : Webb ? Dave, are you there ? Before he can answer, Owen kicks him and knocks him out.\nGUARD : Oh !\nTOSHIKO (from comm) : One minute, twenty until the backup generator comes online. Owen turns and runs toward the main house.\nFARRINGTON (from radio) : This is Farrington to all units. The backup generator will be running in 45 seconds. Stay at your posts, please.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - FRONT DOORS / FOYER - NIGHT\nOwen reaches the front doors and kneels in front of the glass.\nFARRINGTON (from radio) : Mr. Parker's personal generator is unaffected.\nTOSHIKO (from comm) : Sorry, Owen, they've obviously had some work done. He pushes the front doors open and steps cautiously into the house. As he walks in, he notices the green sensor lights on the floor.\nOWEN : Heat sensors. He waves his arm direction in its path. Nothing. He looks at his hand.\nOWEN : I am literally too cool for school. He turns his flashlight on and looks around. He makes his way into the house.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\nOwen makes his way through the hallway.\nOWEN : Right, I'm in.\nTOSHIKO (from comm) : Okay, the energy reading seems to be coming from the first floor. A room at the back of the house.\nOWEN : Can you give me anything else ?\nTOSHIKO (from comm) : No, the energy source is playing havoc with the system, sorry.\nOWEN : No worries. I'm getting used to being in the dark. Owen reaches a room that looks like the kitchen. The power switches on and the lights power up. Owen runs.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS\nOwen starts up the stairs. A security guard appears at the top of the steps behind Owen.\nSECURITY GUARD : Hold it there. Owen stops. He pushes his hood back and looks at the security guard at the top of the stairs, measuring him.\nOWEN : Evenin'. Nice place you've got here. (Starts up slowly). Love what you've done with the pictures.\nSECURITY GUARD : Who are you ? Why aren't the sensors picking you up ? There are sensors at each corner of the window Owen is walking past. The guard starts getting nervous. Owen continues up the stairs.\nSECURITY GUARD : Okay, stop ! Stop or I'll shoot.\nOWEN : No, you won't. You're a security guard. Come on, that gun's just for show, innit ? Owen continues up the stairs.\nOWEN : Do you know what a bullet does to a living person ? It's not like a knife through butter, no, no, no, no. It rotates, tears into the flesh and the gooey stuff behind... it rips into the organs, and, ooh, it's not nice. Owen is nearly to the top of the stairs.\nOWEN : But anyway, I haven't got any body heat. You must know what that means ? You can't kill a dead man.\nSECURITY GUARD : What are you ?\nOWEN : I'm wrong.\nSECURITY GUARD : What are you ?! Owen shows him his broken left hand.\nOWEN : I'm broken. I'm Dr Owen Harper. Owen grabs the gun away from the security guard.\nOWEN : And I'm having one hell of a day. Owen smashes the gun into the security guard's face, knocking him out. Owen steps over the guard, drops the security guard's gun near him and takes his own gun out. The cartridge clicks as he snaps it in place.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\nOwen starts down the hallway, his gun held out in front of him.\nEXT. OUTSIDE PROPERTY\nJack and Martha wait.\nINT. THE HUB - NIGHT\nIanto and Gwen wait.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nOwen continues through the hallway. He checks the first door, then continues. Owen reaches the end of the hallway. He opens the door and enters the room. In the room is a shelf with various items on display. Owen looks at the items. Whatever he's looking for isn't there. He turns and looks at a second shelf with more items on display. Again, not there. Owen lifts his gun and heads for the door at the back of the room.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - PARKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\nOwen opens the door and finds Parker's bedroom, a large mosquito net-covered bed in the middle of the room with various medical equipment and monitors around it. Owen walks in. Henry Parker is on the bed, seemingly asleep. Owen turns to look at some items on display on a shelf.\nHENRY PARKER : Yes ? Owen is startled. He turns and finds Henry Parker awake. A heart monitor beeps steadily.\nOWEN : It's okay, mate. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm a doctor.\nHENRY PARKER : You're a very violent doctor. I've been watching you. Parker lifts his hand and indicates the security monitors set up nearby. Owen pushes the netting aside to look at the old man.\nOWEN : Henry Parker, yeah ?\nHENRY PARKER : You're Torchwood, yes ? INTERCUT WITH : Outside, Jack and Martha listen. HENRY PARKER (from Owen's comm) : Did the American send you ? Martha turns and looks at Jack. Jack looks at Martha.\nOWEN : Yeah, he sent me. How do you know so much about us ?\nHENRY PARKER : They could've sent that Japanese girl, I like her. INTERCUT WITH : In the hub, Toshiko listens and is surprised.\nOWEN : Yeah, well, I'm sorry. You got me.\nHENRY PARKER : Is she... uh... on your phone thing ? That earpiece ?\nOWEN : Yeah.\nHENRY PARKER (to Toshiko) : Hello ! Just to say you've got very lovely legs. (Toshiko smiles). You should show them off more. Parker coughs.\nOWEN : What's wrong with you ?\nHENRY PARKER : Three heart attacks and a failed bypass. But I'm fine, because I have this. Parker takes out the alien device hidden under his covers. It looks like a large shell. It glows, pulses with light and emits a hollow sound.\nHENRY PARKER : It's called \"the Pulse\".\nOWEN : You know what it is ? Owen takes his backpack off and opens it.\nHENRY PARKER : I named it. It's keeping me alive. (Owen takes his hand-held device out to measure the energy readings). No ! You're not taking it. Owen takes his readings.\nOWEN : It could be dangerous. We've been detecting massive energy readings.\nHENRY PARKER : I don't care. All I know is, it works.\nOWEN : Well, I'm sorry, it doesn't.\nHENRY PARKER : What ?\nOWEN : The energy isn't going into you. The power's just building up inside that thing, that's what we've been detecting but... it isn't actually doing anything for you.\nHENRY PARKER : You're wrong. I can feel it. No, no. I'm not going to die.\nOWEN : Listen, please. Listen to me. There are loads of people's lives at risk. If that explodes, then we don't know what the fallout will be.\nHENRY PARKER : You're young. You don't understand what dying feels like.\nOWEN : Believe me, I do. I really do.\nHENRY PARKER : There's nothing there !\nOWEN : Where ?\nHENRY PARKER : On the other side, nothing. I'm dying. Take away my Pulse and I'm gone, my body decomposing.\nOWEN : You can't stop it, Mr. Parker. I'm sorry, but it's going to happen one day. Owen pulls up a chair and sits down next to the bed.\nHENRY PARKER : It'll be dark and I'll be alone.\nOWEN : Where are you now ? It's dark and you're all alone, so what's the difference ?\nHENRY PARKER : I don't understand what's keeping me here. Parker coughs. The monitor alarm beeps. Owen puts the oxygen mask on Parker and lets him breathe in deep. After he's calmed down and the monitor alarm stops, Owen removes the oxygen mask.\nOWEN : It's hope. That thing... it's just hope. Do you really think all this is better than death ?\nHENRY PARKER : It's got to be. It is better !\nOWEN : You're just scared of the darkness. Join the club. Trust me. I know how sh1t everything can be.\nHENRY PARKER : Eh... Don't you sit there pontificating, you're just a boy. What do you know about anything ? I've traveled the world. I fought in the war. Started my own business. I made a fortune. Married. Widowed. My collection, all of it. I've done so much and this is where I ended up. Alone. Lying in my own piss and do you know what I want ?\nOWEN : Clean sheets ?\nHENRY PARKER : I want a steak. Medium rare. Black pepper sauce. Look at me ! Fed through a tube. I might as well be dead already. (The Pulse keens. Softly). I might as well be dead. Why don't you take it ? Parker lifts the Pulse and offers it to Owen.\nHENRY PARKER (softly) : Take it. Owen takes it from him and sets it aside on the bed.\nOWEN : Well ?\nHENRY PARKER : Oh, Christ, it's dark, I'm alone, I'm so alone. Owen reaches for his hand and holds it.\nOWEN : It's all right, I'm here with you.\nHENRY PARKER : Uh. I'm still stuck here, though. In this bed, in the dark.\nOWEN : You know what ? I'm going to come back. You and me. We're going to face all of this together. I'm going to help you.\nHENRY PARKER : Torchwood, if you come back, you can tell me all about it. Tell me what it's like. I want to hear about the aliens and everything ! I need... I need to know that there's more out there. That this isn't all there is. (Off Owen's hesitant look). Oh, come on ! I'm dying, who am I going to tell, the Angel Gabriel ? If you come back, I won't tell the Japanese girl that you're still holding my hand.\nOWEN : Well, maybe. Parker smiles. He starts coughing and the heart monitor flatlines. Owen turns and reaches for the oxygen mask. He puts it on Parker's face.\nOWEN : Deep breath. Owen turns and presses the buttons on the machine.\nOWEN : Mr. Parker ? The heart monitor flatlines. Parker doesn't respond. Owen sets the oxygen mask aside.\nOWEN : Henry ? Still no response. Owen gets to work. He turns and checks the monitors. He checks Parker for a pulse and removes the pillow from behind his head. He starts chest compressions and leans in to give him mouth-to-mouth when he stops. He has no breath to give him. He lifts his hand to his mouth. No breath. Owen hits the bed in frustration.\nOWEN : I'm sorry. I'm so sorry ! Owen puts his head down in frustration and despair.\nOWEN (PRE-LAP, v.o.) : I couldn't save him.\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - PRESENT\nOWEN : He needed to give him air but I couldn't. I've got no breath ! Everything I've seen, everything that's out there and it was an old man dying of a heart attack. It was just another person dying because of me. (Owen climbs up on the wall and stands up). Everything that's happened and that was the final straw. Because at that moment I just wanted it all to end.\nTOSHIKO (PRE-LAP, from comm.) : Owen.\nOwen closes his eyes.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - PARKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\nOwen's head is down on Parker's chest. The Pulse is glowing dangerously bright next to him.\nTOSHIKO (from comm.) : Owen, can you hear me ? Owen doesn't respond. INTERCUT WITH :\nINT. THE HUB\nTOSHIKO (firmly) : Owen, come in !\nOwen stirs.\nOWEN (mumbles) : Yeah, yeah, I'm here.\nTOSHIKO : The device ? Is it doing anything ? (Owen glances at the Pulse). Because the energy levels coming from it are... Owen ? It's going off the screen. INTERCUT WITH : The bright light on Toshiko's monitor grows brighter and brighter with waves of energy emitting from the source.\nTOSHIKO : It's going to explode ! INTERCUT WITH :\nJACK : Tosh ? What can we do ?\nTOSHIKO : Nothing ! There's nothing ! Gwen and Ianto head toward Toshiko. Owen reaches for the Pulse. He's strangely calm about it.\nOWEN : It's okay. I'm going to hold it.\nJACK : Owen, what are you doing ?\nOWEN (from comm) : See if I can absorb it.\nTOSHIKO : Owen, the energy reading's off the scale. You won't survive. Owen tucks the Pulse in the crook of his arm and cradles it close to his body.\nOWEN : It's okay. These things happen.\nMARTHA : There must be something we can do.\nOWEN (from comm) : Martha, Martha.\nMARTHA : Owen ?\nOWEN : If it destroys me, they're going to need a new doctor. You've got all the credentials : medical skills, a cracking arse. Toshiko, Gwen and Ianto listen. Everyone is quiet. He means it.\nOWEN : Jack ? If you even attempt to bring me back again. Gwen, Ianto, it was fun. Honestly, thank you. Tosh ? (Silence) Tosh ? Come on, answer me.\nTOSHIKO : Owen.\nOWEN : I'm sorry. Beat.\nTOSHIKO : I love you. Waves of colored light float out of the Pulse as it grows and ribbons out... reaching. Owen closes his eyes and holds onto the Pulse. The light continues to grow and reach out past Owen.\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - PRESENT\nOwen and Maggie are up on the roof.\nMAGGIE : What happened ?\nOWEN : We all assume life's going to be sh1t, don't we ? That it's all just darkness. But you know what ? Sometimes, it's not. Owen gets off the wall. He kneels and opens his backpack on the ground. He takes out the Pulse. Bursts of ribbons of light continue to fluctuate out from the device. He turns and shows it to Maggie. She kneels to look at it, enraptured by it.\nMAGGIE : What is it ?\nOWEN : Do you remember in the '70s, NASA sent messages into space ? A map of our solar system, pictures of what we look like. It had images and voices, music. Even a bit of Chuck Berry. Well, this is a reply, not that we know who from.\nMAGGIE : What does it do ?\nOWEN : It sang to me. He holds it up to her. A ribbon of light reaches out from the device. It floats and waves back and forth between them.\nOWEN : It's a glimmer of light in the darkness. See ? Sometimes it does get better. They take a moment and watch the light.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. CARDIFF CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT\nEXT. THE PLAZA - NIGHT\nJack, Owen and Martha get out of the SUV. Gwen and Ianto join them. Owen turns and helps Martha out of the back seat.\nOWEN : Well, I'm sorry, Dr. Jones. No vacancies in Cardiff just yet.\nMARTHA : That's okay. I reckon you're... I was going to say \"fine\", but you're a hell of a lot more than that.\nOWEN : Thank you. For everything. Owen kisses Martha on the cheek. He gives her a hug.\nJACK (interrupts) : Oi ! Jack smiles.\nMARTHA : That's what I'm here for. Martha goes over to Gwen, who gives her a hug.\nGWEN : You take care.\nMARTHA : Okay. Martha gives Ianto a kiss on the cheek. She turns to Jack.\nMARTHA : Well, it's been... interesting.\nJACK : Oh, it's been fun. (Soft) You know it has. Martha surprises Jack and kisses him. She steps back and he looks at her curiously.\nMARTHA (chuckles) : Well, everyone else has had a go. He cups her cheek and looks at her seriously.\nJACK : You can so come back anytime.\nMARTHA : Well, maybe I will. One day. She taps her fingers to her forehead in a salute. Jack salutes her. Martha walks away with her bag and case.\nINT. THE HUB - NIGHT\nToshiko and Owen sit on the couch and talk.\nTOSHIKO : Promise me something.\nOWEN : What's that ?\nTOSHIKO : No more locking it all away. You tell me when it's bad. Share it with me. Okay ?\nOWEN (nods) : Okay. Tosh, I'm scared. I'm scared that if I close my eyes I'll get trapped, in the darkness. She holds onto his arm.\nTOSHIKO : I'm here. Owen thinks about it for a moment, then puts his hand on hers. She puts her other hand on his.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT\nOwen is walking along the sidewalk. As he walks, something flutters to the ground right in front of him. He picks it up and finds that it's a folded photo of a man and woman. He thinks about it for a moment. Where could it have come from? He looks up and sees a young woman on the edge of the rooftop.\nOWEN (v.o.) : And that's when I saw you.\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - PRESENT\nMAGGIE : I thought you came here to jump ?\nOWEN : No, I came here to help.\nHe returns her folded photo back to her. She takes it and opens it.\nMAGGIE : What do I do now ?\nOWEN : You've got a choice. If you think that the darkness is too much, then go for it. But if there is a chance, just some hope. It could be having a cigarette, or that first sip of hot tea on a cold morning, or it could be your mates, if there's even a tiny glimmer of light then don't you think that's worth taking a chance ? Maggie's quiet.\nOWEN : What's your name ?\nMAGGIE : Maggie. Maggie Hopley. With his free hand, Owen holds Maggie's hand. In his other hand, he's holding the Pulse which has now blossomed with even more ribbons of light.\nOWEN : Well, Maggie, it's up to you. Your choice. (Owen looks at the Pulse). Do you still want to jump ? They stand there together.\nOWEN (v.o.) : My name is Owen Harper and this is my life. The ribbons of light reach out and grow from the Pulse. It zooms out, twists, curls and reaches out toward the city.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

        "prompt_0": "Act One.\nScene One - Frasier's Apartment. It's the early evening. Frasier is playing a tune on the piano, Martin is looking through some old police work, and Daphne is busying herself in the kitchen. Frasier turns round to find Eddie staring at him.\nFrasier: Dad, he's doing it again! Must this dog stare at me all the time?\nMartin: I don't know. Eddie - must ya? [Eddie carries on staring] Apparently he must.\nFrasier: [to Eddie:] What is so fascinating about me? What is it? Do you imagine I am a large piece of kibble? Am I some sort of canine enigma? Think about it, get back to me.\nDaphne enters carrying a tray of food.\nDaphne: Here we are, gents, dinner's up. [to Martin:] Can I give you a hand clearing up your papers?\nMartin: No, you better let me. I need to keep these in a particular order.\nDaphne: What is all this, anyway?\nMartin: Oh, it's an old case of mine from the police force - the \"Weeping Lotus\" murder.\nFrasier: Dad, I can't believe you're still trotting this old thing up. He's been trying to solve this case for twenty years.\nMartin: Yeah, and I'm not stopping until I do solve it. You adopt certain instincts when you're a cop. And my instinct tells me that this case can be cracked. There just must be one small thing I keep overlooking. [tidies papers]\nFrasier: There is - who the murderer was. [laughs]\nThe doorbell sounds and Frasier goes to answer it as Daphne and Martin chat.\nDaphne: It's nice you feel so dedicated.\nMartin: It's a hobby. Some guys build a boat in their garage, I try to figure out why a maniac would kill a hooker and try to stuff her entire body into a bowling bag. It's relaxing!\nAt this point Frasier opens the front door to Niles who is carrying a bottle of wine. He enters and hands the wine to Frasier.\nFrasier: Hello, Niles.\nNiles: Sorry I'm late, Frasier. Just as we were leaving, Maris had a run-in with a rude directory assistance operator and it shattered her calm.\nFrasier: Have you ever considered that maybe Maris is a bit high strung? Maybe she should see someone.\nNiles: She's seen everyone, why do you think she was calling directory assistance?\nDaphne: Evening, Dr. Crane.\nNiles: Hello, Daphne. It's so good to see you again. [she puts the meal down] What an enchanting scent you're wearing.\nDaphne: [smells herself] Must be the ranch dressing. Won't Mrs. Crane be coming?\nNiles: No, I'm afraid. And please, no more of this \"Doctor\" and \"Mrs. Crane\" formality. To you, it's Niles and... [stumped] er...\nFrasier: Maris.\nNiles: Yes, Maris.\nMartin: Glad you could join us, Niles.\nNiles: Oh, I wouldn't have missed it.\nMartin: Well, I guess the food's all ready: why don't we just go ahead and start?\nEveryone sits down except Daphne who begins to take her food into the kitchen.\nDaphne: Well, enjoy.\nMartin: Where are you going?\nDaphne: I thought I'd have mine in the kitchen.\nMartin: Don't be ridiculous.\nNiles: Yes, we can't have you eating by yourself in the kitchen. I'll join you.\nMartin: No. We're all eating right here, like a family, end of discussion.\nDaphne: Well, isn't this nice? Feels just like home.\nNiles: I'm famished.\nFrasier: Me, too.\nNiles and Frasier begin to eat...\nMartin: You boys still say a prayer before you eat?\nThey relent and pretend they do. All four close their eyes and hold their hands together. As Martin begins his prayer, Niles stares at Daphne as Eddie stares at Frasier. Daphne does not notice with her eyes shut. However, Frasier notices Eddie's skin-creeping look.\nMartin: We thank you, Lord, for the food we're about to eat. You have blessed our table with your palm. And thank you, Lord, for bringing this family together and we also thank you for the other gifts you have given to us. And may we always be able to share with those less fortunate...\nFrasier: [to Eddie:] OH, WILL YOU STOP STARING!\nNiles: [off guard:] I wasn't staring!\nMartin: [takes what he can get] Amen.\nThey all settle down. Daphne looks at Niles a little suspiciously as he begins the meal conversation.\nNiles: So Frasier, did you happen to read Derek Mann's column today? You were mentioned.\nFrasier: No, I missed it.\nNiles: Just as well, it wasn't flattering.\nFrasier: I still would have liked to have seen it anyway.\nNiles: Oh, why didn't you say so? [takes it out of his pocket]\nDaphne: If I may ask, who's Derek Mann?\nMartin: He writes that \"Mann About Town\" column for the Times. The things that guys comes out with, sometimes he's really funny - what did he say about you?\nFrasier: [reading:] \"I hate Frasier Crane.\"\nMartin: [laughs, then:] Oh, sorry.\nFrasier: That's it. \"I hate Frasier Crane.\" That's it?\nMartin: Oh, don't let it bother you.\nFrasier: Well, actually it doesn't, dad. I knew when I chose a career in the public eye that I'd be open to certain criticisms, it's the price I pay for my celebrity. Thank you, Niles, for bringing me the paper, and thank you for highlighting it in yellow! Now, who would like some wine?\nDaphne: Oh, I'll have some.\nFrasier goes to pour some as Niles compliments Daphne.\nNiles: Daphne, this salad is exquisite.\nFrasier: [sitting down:] Now why would he say that?\nMartin: Must be the carrots, he always did like them.\nFrasier: Not the salad, Derek Mann. I mean, why would he write a thing like that? I've never done anything to him, the attack is totally unwarranted. I'm a healer, for God's sake.\nMartin: Oh, for crying out loud!\nFrasier: Dad, I have every right to feel upset about this - I will not enjoy my dinner until this is where it belongs - in the trash.\nFrasier goes to bin it as Niles tries to stop him.\nNiles: Oh, oh, there was an article in there I wanted to save.\nMartin: On what?\nNiles: Nothing.\nMartin: Come on, I'm interested.\nNiles: Oh, let's drop it.\nMartin: Why can't you tell me?\nNiles: All right, it was all about Margaret Thatcher's secret for growing prize-winning zinnias. Are you happy?\nMartin: [beat] Not really.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOH, YEAH...\nScene Two - Radio Station. The following afternoon Frasier is taking a call on air in his booth as Roz listens.\nFrasier: All right, Lorraine. Now, calm down and try and listen to what I'm going to say to you. Will you do that?\nLorraine: [v.o:] Okay.\nFrasier: All right, good girl. Now your problem...\nLorraine: [beep] Oh my gosh, another call waiting - someone else is trying to get through. Do you mind if I take it?\nFrasier: No, no. Go right ahead. [she does] Well, certainly a very interesting situation she's got herself into. Don't you think so, Roz?\nRoz is busy eating and reading magazines. She has to quickly chew her food, put down her books just for the simple:\nRoz: Yes.\nLorraine: Okay, I'm back.\nFrasier: All right, Lorraine. Now listen very carefully to what I'm going to tell you. Your problem seems...\nLorraine: [beep] Oh, I'm sorry, I'll be right back.\nFrasier: For someone who's got so many problems she certainly is popular. [laughs]\nLorraine: Okay, go ahead Dr. Crane. I'm here. [beep] Oh, I don't believe it - another call.\nFrasier: Hold it there, Lorraine. The reason why you want to take that other call is the same reason that you want to change your career and break up with your boyfriend. You're obsessed with what you think you're missing. The better offer, the call on the other line. Well, you've got to take one call at a time from now on. Fully explore and experience each one in its turn and you'll be a stronger person for it. Do you follow me, Lorraine?\nLorraine: Okay, I'm back!\nFrasier: Thank you for your call. [hangs up] Well, we've only got two minutes left, so I would like to end today's program on a personal note. As some of you may know, yesterday I was mentioned in Derek Mann's \"Mann About Town\" column. He said, and I quote, \"I Hate Frasier Crane\"... \"I Hate Frasier Crane\". [sarcastic:] What trenchant criticism. Move aside Voltaire, step back in the shadows H.L. Mencken, there's a new kid in town. One can only wonder how many hours Derek Mann sat in the glow of his computer screen before his trembling fingers sprang to life and pecked out this chef\nt'ouerve: \"I Hate Frasier Crane.\" A lesser critic would have wasted our time by presenting a well thought-out, point by point, constructive critique of this show. No, not our Mr. Mann. So dear listeners, when Mr. Mann's column arrives on your front doorstep - read it, enjoy it, but above all, treasure it. For one day this man will be joining the Pantheon of the immortals. And if we're lucky... it'll be one day soon. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. [signs off]\nFrasier presses the off air button, and twirls his microphone around before blowing on it as if it were his weapon, then \"holsters\" it in his belt.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nYEAH!\nScene Three - Café Nervosa. The following afternoon Frasier is drinking a coffee in the café with Roz when Niles enters and sits with him.\nNiles: Frasier, how funny running into you here.\nFrasier: I'm always here.\nNiles: Yes well, you weren't here twenty minutes ago: have you seen today's \"Times\"?\nFrasier: [knowing what's coming:] No.\nNiles: Lucky for you I saved you this copy. Take a look at Derek Mann's column.\nFrasier: You know, this is the second time in as many days that you have given me a paper. Have you ever considered getting yourself a route?\nNiles: [to Roz:] Hello, I don't believe we've met.\nRoz: Yes we have, Niles, three or four times. Roz Doyle.\nNiles: Oh, of course. It was at the... it was during the... well, I'm far too successful to feel awkward. Where did we meet?\nRoz: The radio station.\nNiles: Ah, I'll take your word for it. Nice to see you again. [then, to Frasier:] Mr. Mann heard your program yesterday.\nFrasier: So I see. [reading:] \"Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Frasier Crane got on my case for not giving him a point by point criticism of his radio show. Well, he asked for it, so here goes.\"\nRoz: [noticing:] Oh my god, his entire column is about your show.\nNiles: Not very flattering either. Towards the end he even attacks your \"dimwitted sidekick call screener.\"\nRoz: [appalled:] That's me!\nNiles: Oh, now I remember you!\nFrasier: [reading:] \"It's hard to say what I hate most about Crane's show - his pompous, sanctimonious style, his constant self- congratulatory references to his own life, or his voice: a mock- sympathetic tone so sickly sweet one wonders if the man graduated from medical school or from some mind-controlling cult.\"\nNiles: It's continued on twelve.\nFrasier: I've read enough!\nWaiter: [asking:] Can I get you something?\nFrasier: [to Niles:] How can the man think something like that?\nWaiter: It's my job, I'm a waiter.\nFrasier: We don't want anything, thank you.\nRoz: Frasier, I know this stinks, but in a couple of days it'll blow over.\nFrasier: Oh, perhaps you're right. As angry as it makes me, to retaliate would be to stoop to his level. So the best response is no response at all.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene Four - Radio Station. Soon after these comments he is already shouting into his microphone about the recent newspaper report.\nFrasier: [angry:] \"Pompous and sanctimonious,\" am I?! Well, this Mann character can't even write grammatical sentences! Every five words there's one of his precious \"dot, dot, dots.\" Must be because he likes writing all those dots with the crayon he writes this drivel in!\nRoz, who looks like she has been listening to him rant for quite a while, tries to steer him back to the show.\nRoz: Dr. Crane, on line two we have Stewart who's having a problem with delayed gratification.\nFrasier: Well, he's just going to have to wait! I don't know who this Derek Mann thinks he is, but if he thinks he can hide behind his newspaper like some sniveling schoolchild cowering behind a tree, then I say let's expose this Derek Mann for\nwhat he is: not a man at all, but half a man! [to Roz:] Now what line did you say Stewart was on?\nRoz: He hung up.\nFrasier: Well, I'm leaving all sorts of bodies in my wake today. Let's see who's on line five. [he presses button:] Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane - I'm listening.\nDerek: [v.o:] Good, because I was listening too.\nFrasier: And you are?\nDerek: Derek Mann.\nFrasier: [regretting:] I see.\nDerek: Look, nobody calls me half a man - especially some Ivy League twit. So what do you say we settle this like men?\nFrasier: Are you implying that you want to fight me?\nDerek: I'm not implying, I'm saying.\nFrasier: Fight, as in a fist fight?\nDerek: [sarcastic:] No, I thought we might throw pies at each other! So are you up to it, or aren't you man enough?\nFrasier: [thinks] We'll be right back after these messages.\nFrasier signs off for commercials as we fade out.\nEnd Of Act One. (Time: 11:05) Act Two.\nScene One - Radio Station. The scene resumes where we left off. The commercials have finished and Frasier gets back to his radio show.\nFrasier: And we're back. Well, we have a surprise caller on the line: Derek Mann.\nDerek: [v.o:] So what's it going to be, Crane, are you going to fight me or not?\nFrasier: Oh, you can't be serious.\nDerek: Just like I figured, you're chicken.\nFrasier: No, I just don't think that civilized people behave that way. You know, Roz, perhaps our listeners have an opinion about that subject? Who do we have on the line?\nRoz: Well, lines one through eight are people who think you're chicken.\nDerek: You're chicken, Crane. Admit it!\nFrasier: I am not chicken!\nDerek: [squawks like a chicken]\nFrasier: We are mature thinking people, not cavemen!\nDerek: [squawks some more]\nFrasier: Alright, if you want a fight so bad, I'll give you a fight! You just say the time and place!\nDerek: Kinsley square, right outside your office, by the old statue. Noon tomorrow. Don't back out!\nFrasier: I won't! Don't you back out either because I know where your office is too, and I know where you live, and I'll track you down! Now who else out there wants a piece of me?!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nET TU, EDDIE?\nScene Two - Frasier's Apartment. That evening Martin is searching through his old case as Daphne passes him.\nDaphne: Having a look at that old murder case again?\nMartin: Yeah, I've dug out the old crime scene photos.\nDaphne: Well, don't be a greedy guts - let me have a look.\nDaphne has a look at the photo of the girl. After a while her psychic powers kick in.\nDaphne: Her name was Helen.\nMartin: Yeah, it was. [knowing her trick:] Ah, you must have seen it on some of my papers I've had lying around here.\nDaphne: No, I just got this feeling when I touched the picture.\nMartin: You're putting me on.\nDaphne: She had a lot of men in her life.\nMartin: No kidding: she was a hooker!\nDaphne: No, I mean she had four brothers.\nMartin: [surprised:] That's amazing. She did have four brothers. What else are you getting? Well, come on, tell me more.\nDaphne: I can't just turn it on and off like a faucet.\nMartin: Give it a try, will you? Please. What else are you getting?\nDaphne: Nothing. [suddenly:] No, wait. I see a man.\nMartin: Yeah?\nDaphne: A well-dressed man. He's wearing wing tips and a trench coat.\nMartin: Yeah? Yeah?\nDaphne: He's getting off an elevator... he's walking down a long hallway... she doesn't know he's coming... he's opening the door...\nAt this moment, a well-dressed man enters the apartment wearing wing tips and a trench coat - it's Frasier.\nFrasier: Hello, everyone.\nDaphne: Sometimes I get my signals crossed.\nFrasier: What's going on?\nMartin: Well - unless you killed a hooker when you were twelve - nothing much!\nDaphne: We heard your show today. I just loved the way you handled that Derek Mann.\nMartin: You made your old man proud. Yet the best part was when he challenged you to a fight and you stood right up to him.\nFrasier: [worried:] Yes I did, didn't I?\nMartin: I can't wait to see that.\nFrasier: Oh, I'm not actually going to go through with it, dad.\nMartin: What are you talking about?\nFrasier: Well, I already won our little war of words. What would I stand to benefit by going through with actually going through with a fist fight?\nMartin: Frasier, maybe I'm misunderstanding here... he challenged you and you're backing down?\nFrasier: Well, mature people are supposed to use their intellect to settle their differences.\nMartin: A man doesn't just turn his tail and run - that's not the way I brought you up.\nFrasier: Are you encouraging me to fight?\nMartin: You bet I am - you gave the guy your word.\nFrasier: Yes, but I didn't even know what I was saying - I hadn't even had lunch yet.\nMartin: I might have known this would have happened. It's Billy Kreizel all over again.\nFrasier: What did you say?\nMartin: Something about a Billy Kreizel, I believe.\nFrasier: I can't believe you're dragging that up - that was thirty years ago.\nDaphne: Who's this Billy Kreizel?\nFrasier: Oh, he was this kid in fifth grade that used to torment me!\nMartin: So one day Frasier made fun of Billy's crewcut.\nFrasier: Well, he started it by making fun of the elbow patches on my blazer!\nMartin: Well, the point is, they were supposed to meet for a fight after school. Only \"Patches\" here didn't show up!\nFrasier: I had a clarinet lesson!\nMartin: You don't need to remind me of that! Billy's old man was a cop, too. Boy, the guys rode me about that excuse of yours for years. Every time I couldn't make it out for a drink they used to say, \"What's the matter? You got a clarinet lesson?\"\nDaphne: [wondering:] Couldn't you and Billy have met after the clarinet lesson?\nFrasier: Daphne, would you please excuse us for a moment!\nDaphne: [gets up:] I have a feeling I'm going to be excused quite a lot in this house.\nShe exits to the kitchen.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nFrasier: [sarcastic:] Dad, I am sorry if I embarrassed you for not fighting Billy Kreizel thirty years ago. But the situation is not the same now.\nMartin: It's exactly the same.\nFrasier: I am an adult now, I've been to medical school, I hold a certain position in this city - I do not settle my differences with brawling.\nMartin: The man challenged you and you accepted.\nFrasier: Dad, I can't believe this. You won't be happy until I come home with a black eye.\nMartin: I just want you to do what you said you were going to do. You know, you can talk about your medical school, your intellect, your place in this city, but you know what? It's all one big clarinet lesson... I can't even look at you.\nMartin exits to the kitchen, angry with his son. Frasier is left with little dignity and looks at Eddie for a little support. However, even Eddie turns his face away from him. Frasier can only sulk.\n[N.B. Billy Kreizel is the name of a boy who bullied director David Lee in the sixth grade.]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nREQUIEM FOR A LIGHTWEIGHT\nScene Three - Café Nervosa. The next day, Frasier is preparing for the big fight whilst chatting with Roz.\nRoz: So, I step out of the shower, I look out of the window and I notice the garbage man looking right in at me. So I say, \"Did you get a good look?\" And he says, \"Not completely, turn around.\" Then he smiled, and he's missing a tooth, and that's when the romance went right out of it for me.\nFrasier: Roz, why are you telling me this story?\nRoz: I'm trying to take your mind of the fact that in five minutes you're going to walk right out into that square and get your clock cleaned.\nFrasier: Well, has it ever occurred to you that I might actually win this fight?\nRoz: Your shoe's untied. [Frasier checks his tied shoes] If you fell for that one, you're going down and you're going down hard.\nNiles: [enters] Frasier, there's quite a crowd forming out there. Secretaries with bag lunches, business men, children with balloons...\nFrasier: All that's missing is a mariachi band.\nNiles: They're setting up.\nRoz: Well, I better go find a great place in the crowd. I'll be off to the left, Frasier, for when you tear his ear off and want to throw it to a beautiful senorita.\nShe leaves the Café. Niles looks at Frasier.\nNiles: Frasier, as your brother and as your friend - why are you doing this?\nFrasier: It's Billy Kreizel.\nNiles: [looking around:] Where?\nFrasier: [shakes head] He's not here, Niles. It's just that I ran away from him when I was ten.\nNiles: I remember.\nFrasier: You know, I've been running ever since. You know, this is where it stops. I'm not running anymore.\nNiles: What is it that makes us Crane boys such targets?\nAs he says this, he takes his nail file out of his coat pocket and buffs his nails. He blows on them and offers the file to Frasier which he refuses.\nFrasier: [sarcastic:] Chalk it up to random violence! Niles nods in agreement and exits the café. Martin enters.\nMartin: Hey, there.\nFrasier: Dad? What are you doing here?\nMartin: Look son, I said a couple of things last night that maybe went over the line.\nFrasier: Look dad, if you were worried that you talked me into something that I wasn't ready to do - well, you're wrong. You can relax. I took this on for myself.\nMartin: Good.\nFrasier: Who told you that I was going through with it, anyway?\nMartin: Oh, let's just say a father knows certain things about his son.\nThey smile. Daphne enters.\nDaphne: Good news, I parked in front of a broken meter. We're getting a freebie. Well, good luck, Dr. Crane, with the fight.\nFrasier: Thank you, Daphne. Any psychic predictions on the outcome?\nDaphne: Actually, yes. But don't worry, I'm frequently wrong.\nFrasier removes his jacket and tie. Niles comes in.\nNiles: Frasier, Frasier, there's something I want you to see. [points out of window:] There, the man standing to the left of the statue - I recognize his picture from the newspaper, that's Derek Mann.\nFrasier: He's gigantic!\nDaphne: [looking out:] My God, you could show a movie on his back!\nMartin: Are you sure you want to go through with this?\nFrasier: Yes, yes I am.\nFrasier throws a few shadow punches to loosen himself up.\nMartin: Good, you'll be fine. Just remember this is a street fight and not a boxing match. So fight dirty and throw the first punch!\nDaphne: I found that a swift knee to the groin usually does the trick. [cocky:] If you have any doubts, check with a fellow in Manchester named Nigel Tavers.\nNiles: [begins to leave:] Well, if we want an unobstructed view...\nFrasier: [stops him:] Look, I prefer if you guys stay here. You'll only make me nervous.\nMartin: Whatever you want.\nThey all wish Frasier good luck. As he exits the mariachi band strikes up. They all move over to the window to look out.\nMartin: They've got a mariachi band out there!\nNiles: I'll have to get their card, I need someone for our summer barbeque.\nDaphne: Oh look, they're starting the fight.\nMartin: Nah, they're just circling, sizing each other up. Come on, Frasier, if you're going to hit him, hit him now!\nThey all shout encouragements, then police sirens are heard.\nNiles: Is that the police?\nMartin: Yeah, what are they doing here?\nDaphne: They're breaking it up! Just when they were getting started.\nShouts are heard from the crowd hurling insults at the police force. The officer marches Frasier right into the Café.\nFrasier: Alright, I'll come along peacefully - let me just get my jacket.\nOfficer: Relax, I'm not arresting you. But I'm warning you that in this town we don't settle our differences with street fights - no matter who you are.\nFrasier: Well thank you, officer, you'll have no more trouble from me.\nOfficer: Okay. [exits]\nFrasier: Dad, dad, did you see me? My hands are trembling, my chest is pounding, my mouth is all dry, my knees are like jello... God, I feel great!\nMartin: You did good.\nFrasier: Yeah, I was out there. I was raring to go, you saw that...\nMartin: I know you were. You would have kicked his butt!\nDaphne: From here to Tacoma.\nNiles: [shouting:] I think we should celebrate! Everyone, a round of victory lattes on me.\nAs the gang celebrate, Martin walks up to the officer on the door.\nMartin: Thanks Harry, I owe you one.\nOfficer: No problem, Marty.\nMartin: You cut it pretty close, though. Another minute, then Frasier would have been sidewalk litter. He would have been lunch meat.\nOfficer: Say, some of the guys are getting together later at Duke's. Why don't you come along?\nMartin: Yeah, maybe I will. And you know why I will? Because the Crane boys don't take clarinet lessons anymore.\nOfficer: What the hell are you talking about?\nMartin: [embarrassed:] Oh that's right, you weren't in my precinct.\nEnd Of Act Two.

Uh, midterms are in a few days so it could go up.\nMr. Lahey: Well, what's it at now?\nIsaac: The grade?\nMr. Lahey: Uh, yeah.\nIsaac: Uh, I'm not sure.\nMr. Lahey: But you just said it could go up.\nIsaac: I just - uh, I meant generally.\nMr. Lahey: You wouldn't be lying to me, would you, Isaac?\nIsaac: No.\nMr. Lahey: Then tell me your grade.\nIsaac: I just told you, I don't know.\nMr. Lahey: You wanna take this little conversation downstairs? No? Then tell me the grade, son.\nIsaac: Dad, this semester's only half over.\nMr. Lahey: Isaac?\nIsaac: There's plenty of time -\nMr. Lahey: Isaac.\nIsaac: It's - it's a \"D\".\nMr. Lahey: All right. It's a \"D\". I'm not angry. You know I'm gonna have to find a way to punish you though. You know, I have my responsibility as a parent. So we'll start with something simple, like, uh - Tell you what, you do the dishes and you clean up the kitchen, okay?\nIsaac: Yeah.\nMr. Lahey: Good. Because I - I'd really like to see this place spotless. Know what I'm saying? You know? I mean this entire kitchen. Yeah! Yeah, absolutely - Spotless. Well, that was your fault.\nIsaac: You could have blinded me.\nMr. Lahey: Shut up! It's a scratch! It's hardly even - Isaac. Isaac!\nJackson: Freaks.\nMr. Lahey: Isaac! Isaac! Isaac. Isaac? Isaac? Okay, that's enough. Let's go! That's it, grab your bike and let's go! Isaac? Holy - ! Aah! No! No! No! Aah! No! Aah! No! No! No! No!\nAllison: Hey.\nScott: What are you doing?\nAllison: Just trying to find you.\nScott: Did anyone see you leave?\nAllison: No. No one, I was careful. What's wrong? Is it the full moon tomorrow night?\nScott: No. No, it's not that. Um, I just wanted to ask you some things. About your - um, your family. Actually, your grandfather.\nAllison: Okay, but I don't really know him. I mean, he's kind of just a guy who sends a check in the mail every year for my birthday.\nScott: Does he know about me? About us?\nAllison: No, my dad hasn't said a thing. What is it? Did something else happen?\nScott: We just need to be a lot more careful now.\nAllison: They're not gonna split us apart.\nScott: Not us. Sure no one followed you?\nAllison: Totally, absolutely, 100 million percent sure. My parents are out, anyways.\nScott: Out?\nAllison: Yeah, it's date night.\nPrincipal: Can I help you?\nChris: Well, I hope so, Principal Thomas. As a concerned parent, uh, I was wondering - how long has it been since your last performance review?\nPrincipal: What?\nChris: We were wondering.\nVictoria: Are you aware there's been an alarming drop in academic achievement and test scores over the past few semesters?\nPrincipal: Excuse me?\nVictoria: It's led the parents of Beacon Hills to the unfortunate conclusion that you may no longer be suited to the position of school principal.\nPrincipal: You can't fire me.\nVictoria: True. But we can torture you.\nIsaac: Derek? Derek!\nDerek: What's wrong?\nIsaac: My dad. I think he's dead.\nDerek: What did you do?\nIsaac: That's the thing. It wasn't me.\nScott: I'm serious. It's not like the last full moon. I don't feel the same.\nStiles: Oh, does that include the urge to maim and kill people like me?\nScott: I swear I don't have the urge to maim and kill you.\nStiles: You know, you say that now but then the full moon goes up and out come the fangs and the claws and there's a lot of howling and screaming and running everywhere, okay? And it's very stressful on me and so yes, I'm still locking you up.\nScott: Okay, fine. But I do think I'm in more control now. Especially since things are good with Allison.\nStiles: Okay, I'm aware of how good things are with Allison.\nScott: They're really good.\nStiles: I - thank you, I know.\nScott: I mean, like, really good.\nStiles: All right, I get it! Just please shut the hell up before I have the urge to maim and kill myself.\nScott: All right, did you get something better than handcuffs this time?\nStiles: Yeah, much better.\nCoach: Part of me wants to ask. The other part says knowing will be more disturbing than anything I could ever imagine. So - I'm gonna walk away.\nStiles: That's good. That's a wise choice, coach.\nStiles: You okay? Scott.\nScott: There's another. In here, right now.\nStiles: Another what?\nScott: Another werewolf.\nAllison: You really don't remember anything?\nLydia: They called it a fugue state, which is basically a way of saying \"We have no idea why you can't remember running through the woods naked for two days.\" But personally, I don't care. I lost nine pounds.\nAllison: Are you ready for this?\nLydia: Please. It's not like my aunt's a serial killer.\nAllison: Maybe it's the nine pounds.\nScott: It was kind of like a scent, but I couldn't tell who it was.\nStiles: What if you can get him one - on - one? Would that help?\nScott: Yeah.\nStiles: Okay. I think I got an idea.\nMatt: You need a digital camera?\nJackson: Yeah. And something that can record in low light. All night long.\nMatt: What are you recording?\nJackson: Something in low light. All night long. Do you have the camera or not?\nMatt: You have a hundred bucks?\nJackson: I drive a Porsche. What do you think?\nMatt: I think your parents have a hundred bucks.\nJackson: Just get me the camera.\nStiles: I told coach you're switching with Danny for the day.\nScott: But I hate playing goal.\nStiles: Remember when I said I had an idea? This is the idea.\nScott: Oh.\nStiles: There we go.\nScott: What's the idea?\nStiles: I seriously don't understand how you survive without me sometimes.\nCoach: Let's go! Line it up! Faster! Make daddy proud.\nScott: Here we go.\nScott: Let me help you up.\nCoach: McCall!\nScott: Yeah.\nCoach: Usually the goalie stays somewhere within the vicinity of the actual goal.\nScott: Yes, coach.\nCoach: Let's try it again.\nMatt: What the hell, man?\nScott: My bad, dude.\nCoach: McCall! The position's goal keeper. Not goal abandoner.\nScott: Sorry, coach.\nCoach: Let's go!\nCoach: Stilinski, what the hell is wrong with your friend?\nStiles: Uh, he's failing two classes. He's a little socially awkward and if you look close enough, his jaw line's kind of uneven.\nCoach: That's interesting. Let's fire it up.\nDanny: It's Armani.\nScott: Huh?\nDanny: My aftershave. Armani.\nScott: Oh. It's nice.\nCoach: McCall! You come out of that goal one more time and you'll be doing suicide runs till you die. It'll be the first ever suicide run that actually ends in a suicide. Got it?\nScott: Yes, coach.\nCoach: Yeah.\nJackson: Uh, coach, my shoulder's hurting. I'm gonna - I'm gonna sit this one out.\nIsaac: Don't tell them. Please don't tell them.\nScott: His father's dead. They think he was murdered.\nSheriff: Come on.\nStiles: Are they saying he's a suspect?\nScott: I'm not sure, why?\nStiles: Because they can lock him in a holding cell for 24 hours.\nScott: Like, overnight?\nStiles: During the full moon.\nScott: How good are these holding cells at holding people?\nStiles: People, good. Werewolves, probably not that good.\nScott: Stiles, remember when I said I don't have the urge to maim and kill?\nStiles: Yeah.\nScott: He does.\nScott: Why would Derek choose Isaac?\nStiles: Peter told me that if the bite doesn't turn you it could kill you. And maybe teenagers have a better chance of surviving.\nScott: Doesn't being a teenager mean your dad can't hold him?\nStiles: Well, not unless they have solid evidence. Or a witness. Wait. Danny. Where's Jackson?\nDanny: In the principal's office talking to your dad.\nStiles: What? Why?\nDanny: Maybe because he lives across the street from Isaac.\nScott: Witness.\nStiles: We gotta get to the principal's office.\nScott: How?\nHarris: Everyone please turn to page 73. Who in the hell did that?\nSheriff: Listen to me, you're telling me that you knew Isaac's father was hitting him?\nJackson: Hitting him? He was kicking the crap out of him.\nSheriff: Did you ever say anything to anyone? A teacher, parents, anyone?\nJackson: Nope. It's not my problem.\nSheriff: No, no, of course not. You know, it's funny that the kids getting beaten up are always the ones who least deserve it.\nJackson: Yeah. Wait, what?\nSheriff: I think we're done here. Hi, Scott.\nScott: H - yeah.\nGerard: Boys. Come on in.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nGerard: Scott McCall. Academically not the most accomplished, but I see you have become quite the star athlete. Mr. Stilinski. Oh, perfect grades but little to no extracurriculars. Maybe you should try lacrosse.\nStiles: Oh, actually I'm already -\nGerard: Hold on. McCall. You're the Scott that was dating my granddaughter.\nScott: We were dating but not anymore. Not dating, not seeing any of each other or doing anything with each other - At all.\nGerard: Relax, Scott, you look like you're about to crack a cyanide pill with your teeth.\nScott: Just a hard breakup.\nGerard: Oh, that's too bad. You seem like a pretty nice kid to me. Now listen, guys. Yes, I am the principal, but I really don't want you to think of me as the enemy.\nStiles: Heh, is that so?\nGerard: However, this being my first day, I do need to support my teachers. So unfortunately someone is going to have to take the fall and stay behind for detention.\nLydia: It's just - we haven't really talked since that night and well - Jackson, can you, like, look at me for half la second? They said if you hadn't found me and carried me back, I could have died. So I just - I wanted to say thank you.\nJackson: Lydia, we're not getting back together.\nLydia: What?\nJackson: And just because I kept you from bleeding out on a field once, don't expect me to come running every time you start screaming.\nLydia: I never said -\nJackson: I'm not responsible for you. Okay? But I will give you one piece of advice. If I were you, I'd stay home tonight.\nLydia: What does that mean? What's tonight?\nJackson: It's a full moon.\nDerek: Get in.\nScott: Are you serious? You did that. That's your fault.\nDerek: I know that. Now get in the car and help me.\nScott: No, I've got a better idea. I'm gonna call a lawyer. Because a lawyer might actually have a chance at getting him out before the moon goes up.\nDerek: Not when they do a real search of the house.\nScott: What do you mean?\nDerek: Whatever Jackson said to the cops, what's in the house is worse. A lot worse.\nGerard: I'm not interested in whether they locked up a 16 - year - old kid. I'm interested in what's going to happen to that 16 - year - old when the moon hits its peak tonight. Do we have proof?\nChris: Is the next step killing him?\nGerard: The next step is eliminating the threat. Do we have proof?\nChris: I haven't been in history class for a while, but I'm pretty sure straight - up genocide hasn't worked out too often.\nGerard: Do we have proof or not?\nChris: Not irrefutable. But not insignificant. The driver's side door of Lahey's car was pried off.\nGerard: Pried off?\nChris: Ripped off.\nMatt: I'm starting to feel a little weird about this.\nJackson: No, no, no, no. What you're feeling is a hundred dollars richer. Give me the camera and go buy yourself another fancy lens or light meter or whatever gives your photography geeks a hard - on.\nMatt: This doesn't have anything to do with Allison, does it? I saw you two at the dance the other night and I kind of figured that you two were, you know, together.\nJackson: Aw, you have a little thing for Allison, Matt? A little - a little crush?\nMatt: No.\nJackson: You think I'm gonna waste my time by doing something as unbelievably ordinary as making a s*x tape?\nMatt: Then what are you doing?\nJackson: Documenting history. My history. And I want to be able to see it happening. All of it. You'll get it back tomorrow.\nScott: If Isaac didn't kill his father, who did?\nDerek: I don't know yet.\nScott: Then how do you know he's telling the truth?\nDerek: Because I trust my senses. And it's a combination of them. Not just your sense of smell.\nScott: You saw the lacrosse thing today.\nDerek: Yeah.\nScott: Did it look that bad?\nDerek: Yeah.\nAllison: Sorry.\nChris: Allison?\nGerard: Come in. We'd like to talk to you.\nAllison: I'm supposed to study with Lydia, I really don't have time to chat.\nChris: Actually, that's who we want to talk to you about, sweetheart.\nDerek: You wanna learn? Let's start now.\nScott: What's down there?\nDerek: Motive.\nScott: And what am I looking for?\nDerek: Follow your senses.\nScott: What happened down here?\nDerek: The kind of thing that leaves an impression. Open it.\nStiles: Hey, sorry, Harris literally just let me out of detention. Literally. And he had my phone the whole frickin' time.\nAllison: Well, we need to do something right now. They were asking me all these questions about Lydia and how she was bitten by Peter, and then they sent this guy out.\nStiles: Wait, what guy?\nAllison: He was dressed as a Sheriff's deputy.\nStiles: They're sending him to the station for Isaac.\nAllison: He was also carrying this box with something on it, like, um, like a carving or something.\nStiles: What was it?\nAllison: Hold on, hold on. It's in one of these books. I'm taking a picture. Did you get it?\nStiles: Yeah, wolfsbane.\nAllison: What does that mean?\nStiles: It means they're gonna kill him.\nScott: This is why he said yes to you.\nDerek: Everyone wants power.\nScott: If we help you, then you have to stop. You can't just go around turning people into werewolves.\nDerek: I can if they're willing.\nScott: Did you tell Isaac about the Argents? About being hunted?\nDerek: Yes, and he still asked.\nScott: Then he's an idiot.\nDerek: And you're the idiot dating Argent's daughter. Yeah. I know your little secret. And if I know, how long do you think it's gonna take for them to find out? You saw what happens to an omega. With me, you learn how to use all of your senses. With me, you learn control. Even on a full moon.\nScott: If I'm with you, I lose her.\nDerek: You're gonna lose her anyway. You know that.\nScott: Wait. I'm not part of your pack. But I want him out. He's my responsibility too.\nDerek: Why? Because he's one of us?\nScott: Because he's innocent.\nStiles: Hey, did you slow him down?\nAllison: You could say that.\nStiles: All right, well, uh, I'm headed to the station right now.\nAllison: Where's Scott?\nStiles: Isaac's.\nAllison: Does he have a plan?\nStiles: Yeah, but not a very good one. And unfortunately we don't really have time to come up with anything better.\nAllison: Scott? Are you sure we have to do this?\nScott: Yes.\nAllison: Where?\nScott: Please. I don't want to hurt you.\nStiles: Okay, now the keys to every cell are in a password protected lockbox in my father's office. The problem is getting past the front desk.\nDerek: I'll distract her.\nStiles: Whoa, whoa, whoa - you? You're not going in there. I'm taking my hand off.\nDerek: I was exonerated.\nStiles: You're still a person of interest.\nDerek: An innocent person.\nStiles: An - you? Yeah, right! Okay, fine. What's your plan?\nDerek: To distract her.\nStiles: Uh - huh. How? By punching her in the face? Unh.\nDerek: Heh, by talking to her.\nStiles: Okay, all right. Give me a sample. What are you gonna open with? Dead silence. That should work beautifully. Any other ideas?\nDerek: I'm thinking about punching you in the face.\nDeputy: Good evening, how can I help - you?\nDerek: Hi.\nDeputy: Hi.\nDerek: Um, I had a question.

Coming home to Salem to get out of the war is like jumping in the ocean to get out of the rain.\nIsaac: You can't leave Salem just yet. Something you've got to see.\nMr. Hale: Someone broke our circle.\nMary: Who saw us?\nMr. Hale: I do not know.\nMary: I waited for you. Years and years.\nJohn: Come with me.\nMary: I can't. It's impossible.\nTituba: The grand rite has begun, and the earth cries out for innocent blood.\nMary: I know well my duties.\nGeorge: [Grunts] The only thing that keeps me alive is the look on your face when John Alden finds out what you really are.\nBridget: [Screaming]\nAnne: Father, you know Bridget. How could you think her guilty of this?\nMr. Hale: It isn't a matter of what I think. What a mess you've made of things.\nBridget: [Gasping]\nAnne: [Sobbing]\nMary: I don't want you here.\nJohn: I almost believe you.\n[Insects chirping]\nCotton: You're so beautiful.\n\"Fear no man's war, for only a war from hell could destroy Salem.\" The devil was never going to let a promised land be built here without a battle.\nMary: Do you know what killed nearly every woman buried here? Love.\nCotton: And witches armed with deadly malice...\nMary: Most died in childbirth. So love is to a woman...\nCotton: Are the most malignant and insidious weapons in that battle...\nMary: What war is to a man. The most deadly thing, they'll do.\nCotton: That war for the body and the soul of a nation.\nMary: Only a fool runs quickly to war...\nCotton: Imagine a foe you can't see...\nMary: Or love.\nCotton: Armed with weapons unknown...\nMary: I can teach you...\nCotton: And the ability to appear as anyone.\nMary: About life and death and many things in between.\nAnne: Stop it! Just stop it! Stop.\nCotton: Shh.

Burn!\n[Indistinct shouting]\nTituba: You would do well to pay that boy extra to take them bodies a more circuitous route.\nMary: Spectacle is fuel for our fire.\nTituba: And doubt is indulged by the rich and spoiled only.\nMind that you was born neither.\nWoman: \"Give me to die with thee that I may rise to a new life, \"for I wish to be as dead and buried to sin, to selfishness...\"\nMary: By all means, Reverend... do not offer prayer or comfort or words of encouragement. No, stand as a bewildered statue amongst the people of Salem and offer them absolutely nothing.\nCotton: What would you have me do?\nMary: What I brought you here to do. Guide and support us in our great hour of need. Warm our hearts with your words of wisdom. Assure us it is God's will we do in ferreting out the devil. Or at the very, very least... Pray.\nMr. Hale: Tragic day.\nMary: Tragic but necessary.\nMr. Hale: Tragically necessary. Surely, the grieving of the masses gives you pause.\nMary: Most spit and curse while summoning the burning flames of hell.\nMr. Hale: There are also those who weep for her and find her hanging unfounded.\nMary: Not enough to divert our intentions. A panic's success relies on its escalation. The grand rite has begun. We look to our next victim.\nMr. Hale: And that I disagree, that I strenuously and most vehemently oppose means nothing to you? We were seen at our sabbat. And you throw caution to the wind.\nMary: And have you identified who saw us? Perhaps your disagreements and vehement opposition might hold more weight if you could be relied on to complete a simple task. Good day, Hale.\n[Indistinct shouting]\nCotton: What must I do to be saved?\nIt is impossible to ask a more weighty question. Lest we perish eternally.\nJohn: How's it feel?\nCotton: How does what feel?\nJohn: Killing two innocents in as many days.\nCotton: The evidence against Miss bishop... woman: The orphanage! Help! They're looting the orphanage!\n[Glass shatters]\nAnne: Get out!\nIt's not yours!\n[Baby crying]\nGet John: Next one's to your head.\n[Children crying]\nAre you okay?\nAnne: It's awful. It's too awful.\nMr. Hale: W-what's happened?\nJohn: Thieves have come to ransack the orphanage now that the town sees fit to hang its guardian.\nMr. Hale: Easy, son.\nJohn: This is what comes of your witch panic.\nMr. Hale: Are you all right?\nAnne: This is your fault! And his.\nMr. Hale: [Sighs] Forgive her. She's distraught.\nAnne: I'm right! See me home.\nMr. Hale: Captain, if you wouldn't mind, hmm?\nJohn: Yes. Of course.\nAnne: Where have they taken her?\nJohn: Foul spot where they rest the unwanted.\nAnne: Is it very terrible?\nJohn: Yes.\n[Bell tolling]\nAnne: Thank you...\nFor your heroism and your candor.\n[Horse whinnies]\n[Door opens]\nPetrus: [Laughs] Welcome, welcome, welcome!\nA cup of tea? A touch of port?\nMr. Hale: No time. Who saw us in the woods?\nPetrus: It was... He who is marked. He of the \"F\" that furrows his brow.\nMr. Hale: Isaac?\nPetrus: The fornicator.\nMr. Hale: The idiot.\nPetrus: One more thing. Isaac was not alone.\nMr. Hale: Who else was with him?\nPetrus: I don't know. I could not make out the face.\nMr. Hale: You don't know. What good are you? A seer who can't see.\nPetrus: It's not an exact art.\nMr. Hale: Evidently not.\nPetrus: [Chuckles]\nJohn: Hello?\n[Metal scraping]\n[Crow caws]\nHello?\n[Dog growling]\n[Snarling]\n[Grunts]\n[Breathing heavily]\nJohn: What the hell was that place?\nMr. Hale: The shack belongs to Petrus, an expert on creatures both feral and otherwise.\nJohn: Yeah, well, they looked dead...

To say that he's mundane is to overstate his passion.\nJohn: And what ordinary task brought you deep into the forest to seek his mundane counsel?\nMr. Hale: Easy, son... Or I might suspect your presence here as more than a coincidence, that, perhaps, for reasons of your own about which I'm sure you'd rather I not inquire, you might have followed me here. And what a shame... To have suspicion overtake the grace I owe for the kindness you showed my daughter.\nJohn: Consider it repaid.\nMr. Hale: Right.\nGeorge: [Gagging]\nMary: George, really. [Scoffs] You are worse than a child.\nGeorge: [Groans]\nMary: He serves at my behest, not yours. He won't come out for you. Ohh. There, there, little man. Oh, pay the beast no mind. Rest now, and I'll see to your feeding later.\nTituba: Isaac's brung the master's potions.\nMary: Tell him to wait.\n[Sighs]\nOhh, George. Your nightdress thoroughly drenched in sick. Stew in that for the day, my sweet.\nGeorge: [Gurgles]\nIsaac: For Mr. Sibley.\nMary: Oh, and not a moment too soon. Just now, he suffered a fit of sorts.\nIsaac: If you don't mind me saying so, ma'am, it's a burden you've took on... a burden and load, carried out without cry or complaint.\nMary: My burdens can't compare to that of Salem itself. How do you find the spirits on the square?\nIsaac: Low, ma'am. Awful low.\nMary: Perhaps there is solace to be found in remembrance of times when we've both shouldered worse. Who could have imagined that a single night could have consequence for so many? Not all scars can be seen. But they exist nonetheless.\nIsaac: Next morning, she was gone. Run away and disappeared.\nMary: Oh, your sweet Abby.\nIsaac: I'll admit to wondering on occasion what it might be like to one day see her again or know of her or hear her fate. Would it be better or so much worse?\nMary: I can assure you, Isaac... if you were to see her again, you would find those feelings buried too deeply for hope of resurrection. Good afternoon, Isaac.\nIsaac: G'day, ma'am.\n[Indistinct conversations]\nAah!\n[Grunting]\n[Insects buzzing]\nWhat is that? What is that? What are you... what are you doing? Please. Please.\n[Muffled screaming]\n[Gasps]\n[Breathing heavily]\nPigman: What did you see in the woods?\nIsaac: [Screams]\nPigman: We knew you weren't alone.\nWoman: We know!\nWe know! We know!\nIsaac: [Cries]\nWoman: Who was there?! Who was there?!\nIsaac: I was alone! I was alone!\nMr. Hale: Get it all. Want no trace of our efforts. The fault must lie with him alone.\n[Crow caws]\nAnd put these in his pockets. If he's to be found a witch, the good reverend will require proof... evidence to seal his fate, hmm? What is it? Is this sympathy that I'm sensing? One outcast to the other? Is that what you feel, you decrepit deformity?\nGhoul: Mary!\nMr. Hale: So now even you would question me? Do as you're told! Does your great Mary know what it is to watch witches burn? Nothing of the old ways while she's whipping us toward the new. A spell of vitae cupido, and then we send him to the one place in town that will certainly deny him entrance. That should get their attention.\nGloriana: [Sniffles]\nCotton: You're crying.\nGloriana: [Chuckling] I'm not.\nCotton: You are. What's wrong?\nGloriana: If they can hang a woman like Miss bishop, what does that mean for someone like me?\nCotton: Nothing is going to happen to you.\nGloriana: How can you be so sure? Just yesterday, it was me that they put before the Lewis girl. Would you have come forward had I been accused?\nCotton: I follow every protocol. I adhere to every letter of what my father taught me. No one is convicted without incontrovertible evidence.\nGloriana: So you're certain Miss bishop was a witch?\nCotton: I am certain... Of the evidence.\nGloriana: Why do you do it?\nCotton: Why?\nGloriana: Is it that you believe that you're doing good? Or is it that you wish to please your father?\n[Screaming, glass shattering]\nGloriana: It's Isaac! He's mad!\n[Glass shatters]\n[Screaming continues]\nCotton: I can't be seen here.\nIsaac: [Laughs] Let me touch you!\n[Women screaming]\nGet up!\nWoman: Isaac, no!\nIsaac: Ha ha! Ah ha ha!\n[Women screaming]\nIsaac: [Laughing maniacally]\n[Isaac screaming]\nGloriana: Isaac, what are you doing?\nIsaac: What do you see?!\nCotton: Isaac!\nIsaac: Oh, there you are!\nCotton: Isaac!\n[Women screaming]\nIsaac: Isaac the fornicator! Isaac the fornicator!\nHide your wives! Hide all your sheep! Isaac the fornicator will get them when they sleep! Isaac the fornicator! Hide your wives! Hide your wives! Hide all your sheep! Isaac the fornicator! Hide your wives!\nJohn: Isaac!\nIsaac: Hide your sheep. Isaac the fornicator.\nJohn: Stop! Isaac!\nIsaac: Jonathan, it's no good. It's no good!\nJohn: What is no good?\nIsaac: They saw us. They saw us. They saw us in the woods. They saw us. They saw us in the woods. They saw us.\nJohn: Shut up.\nMr. Hale: Take him to the jail.\nIsaac: They saw us in the woods. They saw us.\nJohn: Shh.\nMary: Magistrate.\nMr. Hale: Mrs. Sibley.\nMary: What have you done?\nMr. Hale: The idiot saw us in the woods.\nMary: Isaac. So, you did this without consent?\nMr. Hale: He wasn't alone. We'll find out who was with him, and he will burn.\nMary: No, you will do nothing further.\nMr. Hale: But...\nMary: Nothing! Go home, Magistrate. You reek of the woods.\n[Horse neighs]\nFind me Rose.\nIsaac: [Groans]\nJohn: A drunken romp, that's all... a young man's prerogative.\nCotton: And yet no smell of spirits on him.\nJohn: Oh, well, burn him, then. Why wait?\nCotton: If he was spelled, he's blameless in his actions.\nJohn: Yet you still hold him. Why?\nCotton: Found on his person. Likely stolen to cast a spell on its owner.\nJohn: One minute, he's speller. The next, he's bewitched. Make up your mind, Reverend. Is he a witch or a victim of the craft?\nCotton: Chief ingredient of a witch's brew.\nJohn: Isaac took me into those woods. He risked his life to show me the witches. Why, if he was one?\nLamb: I've, uh, administrated a tonic that'll settle him down and, uh, end the fits.\nCotton: What is your surgeon's opinion of the boy's condition?\nLamb: I can't say for sure as to cause or source, but going by his babble, that boy is good and touched.\nMr. Hale: Every benefit of the doubt, every Avenue explored. The boy is one of our own. Outcast and shunned as he may be, he still resides in the bosom of Salem. I'll, uh... I'll speak with him personally.\nLamb: [Laughs] Not tonight, you won't.\nMr. Hale: And why not?\nJohn: Lamb gave Isaac a tonic to help him sleep.\n[Horse neighs]\nCotton: Probably best, Magistrate, to return in the morning.\nJohn: Yes, Magistrate. You can have your personal talk with him then.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nMary: Rose, absent the magistrate, what chance have I of harnessing the body's allegiance?\nRose: [Sighs] The others are split between old and new. Difficult to predict the outcome of such a divide.\nMary: You're old and yet somehow not governed by this fear.\nRose: It is not age that divides us, but ambition.\nMary: [Chuckles] Well, he's not without ambition.\nRose: It chafes him to bend to a woman, but he does so that our greater purpose may live.\nMary: It was to be me that led us.\nRose: It was and it is.\nMary: Questioned and challenged at every turn, each and every decision soliciting doubt and scrutiny.\nRose: Much as we may wish it, primacy does not live in the abyss.\nMary: It cannot have all been in vain.\nRose: Sibley.\nYour baby.\nMary: It cannot have all been in vain. This life, my...\nRose: Choices.\nMary: Was there a choice? Or was choice taken from me?\nRose: It's too late now to think of such things.\nMary: Is it?\nRose: It mustn't have been easy seeing him again. It is yours to decide, my girl, what is in vain and what is not.\nMary: And you will stand behind my decision?\nRose: Up to a point.\nMary: Hmm.\nRose: The magister's roots are old. He has seen much and suffered greatly. Do not underestimate him.\n[Thunder rumbles]\nJohn: Mrs. Sibley.\nMary: Captain Alden.\nJohn: Isaac is not a witch.\nYou do nothing, he'll be hung for one. We have to stop this. There's nothing left in you. No feelings, no heart. You're not the girl I once knew.\nMary: Have they questioned him?\nJohn: No. That's because he was given a sleeping tonic.\nMary: So he's said nothing.\nJohn: Nothing. But Cotton is eager, and the magistrate was hard to turn away.\nMary: Hale? Was there?\nJohn: He came straight to question him.\nMary: You have my complete allegiance.\n[Horse neighs]\nCotton: \"Our opportunities to do good are our talents.\"\nMy father said that. The great increase Mather. To stay impartial, to weigh without bias... is this the good I am meant to do? I don't want your life in my hands. Half of Salem takes you for a fool. The rest dismiss you as a pervert. Am I mad to think I saw something in you? Something of a man? And just the sort Salem needs to fight the devil.\n[Thunder rumbles]\nAbigail: [Echoing] Isaac, Isaac. Isaac, Isaac.\nOh, sweet Isaac.\nIsaac: Abby? [Laughs] Abby?\nAbigail: Isaac.\nIsaac: How did you...\nAbigail: Shh. My sweet. Tell me... who was with you in the woods?\nIsaac: Who was what?\nAbigail: The other night. Who was with you?\nMary: Who was with you, my sweet Isaac?\nAbigail: Who was with you, my love? No one can hear us. If you love me, you'll tell me.\nIsaac: I can't.\nAbigail: Tell me, and we'll be together again, just like we were.\nIsaac: [Sighs] I can't.\nAbigail: You can.\nIsaac: I can't.\nCotton: You can't what?\nAbigail: You can. It's okay. Who was with you, my love?\nIsaac: It was John Alden.\n[Door opens]\n[Door closes]\nMary: Good morning, Magistrate.\nMr. Hale: Good morning, Mrs. Sibley.\nWhat an unforeseen delight. Will you join me in some coffee? W-we've been experimenting with a new Brazilian brew.\nMary: May we speak?\nMr. Hale: The ladies are at prayer.\nMary: He was alone... Isaac.\nMr. Hale: You questioned him? How?\nMary: He was alone in the woods. And that ends this persecution.\nMr. Hale: And you're absolutely certain that Isaac was telling the truth?\nMary: The circumstances were such that a lie would not...\ncould not... cross his lips.\nMr. Hale: Well, then, that leaves nothing but to task the selectmen to a vote and hang the boy for witchcraft.\nMary: No.\nMr. Hale: Salem will be no poorer for one less nitwit.\nMary: No.\nMr. Hale: [Sighs]\nWe will never truly know what he saw, and what he saw could get us all killed.\nMary: I can control Isaac.\nMr. Hale: And what of the grand rite? You wanted another victim, and now you have one. Tick-tock, Mrs. Sibley. The next moon fast approaches.\nMary: I will not let this happen.\nMr. Hale: You're powerless to stop it. The council will rule overwhelmingly against it.\nMary: You will not do this! [Plate rattles]\nMr. Hale: It can only be sentiment that's stopping you. Such raw emotion. It makes you vulnerable. Don't let it cloud your purpose. He has to go.\nAnne: Mrs. Sibley.\nMary: Good morning, Anne.\nIsaac: They ain't mine. I've said it 10 ways from Sunday!\nCotton: Then how did they come to be on your person?\nIsaac: I don't know. The pigman must have put them on me. Or that blasted specter from the crags.\nCotton: The pigman?\nIsaac: He saw us that night in the woods. That's why they're doing this to me. Don't you see? They know I seen something.\n[Horse neighs]\n[Sighs]\nCotton: What else do you remember?\nIsaac: From the woods?\nCotton: No.\nFrom the other night. At... at the rod?\nIsaac: The whorehouse? Nothing. I-I-I don't remember anything. I told you...\nMary: Captain, a word. Magistrate Hale will be here soon for Isaac. He's prepared to force a vote and hang him. You will stop him.\nJohn: How?\nMary: Any way you must.\nMr. Hale: Well, the business of Salem awaits no man.\nAnne: I know what you're doing, and I hate you for it.\nMrs. Hale: Unacceptable language. Utterly and completely horrid sentiment.\nAnne: My friend is dead. And you rush out to kill another.\nMr. Hale: Darling, you must understand...\nAnne: Even Mary Sibley, with whom I share not a single common opinion, finds your actions vile!\nMr. Hale: And just how much of my conversation did you feel yourself entitled to?\nAnne: Enough to know that this persecution of Isaac is folly! Will you kill another, father? Is that the \"business\" you're so eager to attend to?\nMr. Hale: Everything I do, I do for this family... For its well-being and for the greater good of this town.\n[Door opens]\n[Door closes]\nAnne: What?\nNo \"how dare you?\" Or \"mind your elders\"?\nMrs. Hale: For once, my daughter, I agree with you.\nAnne: You do?\nMrs. Hale: But if I were you, I'd find an Avenue around your distaste for Mrs. Sibley in order to absorb her manners and ways.\nAnne: She's despicable. I could never be like her.\nMrs. Hale: She is a woman who has found her way to a voice.\nAnne: Look how she uses it.\nMrs. Hale: You could use yours any way you like, but you have to find it first, unless you want to spend the rest of your life shouting at your father... Or... Your husband.\nCotton: What did Mrs. Sibley require?\nJohn: Are you convinced of Isaac's innocence or guilt?\nCotton: I am not convinced of either.\nJohn: Then stay the hell out of my way.\nMr. Hale: We shall take the boy to trial.\nJohn: That path leads to the gallows.\nMr. Hale: It's in no one man's hands.\nJohn: Really? Whose hands is it in?\nMr. Hale: God's, of course.\nJohn: No.\nMr. Hale: Need I remind you, son, that you are impeding the very same man who only yesterday was your savior?\nJohn: Yeah. That was yesterday. You want Isaac today... You got to go through me.\nMr. Hale: The great John Alden disappears for a decade and then dares to come back and dictate how to run our town? Take him.\n[Footsteps]\nTituba: He is not worth this Isaac.\nMary: This has nothing to do with Isaac.\nTituba: I know. Which means it has to do with John Alden.\nMary: The Magistrate will learn who leads us, and he will accept it.\nTituba: Or?\n[Snake hisses]\n[Gasps]\n[Gasping]\n[Choking]\nJohn: [Grunting]\nCotton: Help him.\nIsaac: [Screams]\nMessenger: Magistrate Hale, your daughter!\nMr. Hale: Stop! Get him back in the cell!\nStop! Stop! Get him back in the cell! What? What's happened?\nIsaac: [Grunting]\nLamb: Has she et something strange from the garden or the woods?\nMrs. Hale: No.\nLamb: Was she bit by an insect or a critter?\nMrs. Hale: No, no! Please!\nMr. Hale: What's happened?\nMrs. Hale: She... she can't breathe!\nMr. Hale: For God's sakes, man, do something!\nLamb: She is beyond my arts.\n[Anne choking]\nMrs. Hale: Where...\n[door opens]\nMr. Hale: Stop it! Make it stop!\nMary: Magistrate, good afternoon.\nMr. Hale: I beg of you. Isaac can go free, whatever you want.\nJust make it stop.\nMary: You will not question him.\nMr. Hale: No.\nMary: You will get out of my way. You will let me lead without further interference. I will choose who lives and who dies.\nMr. Hale: Yes, yes. Help her.\nMary: You see, Magistrate, I've lost everything in this town that I ever cared for. You, however, you have everything left to lose...\na sentiment that makes you vulnerable.\nMr. Hale: [Sighs]\nPlease. My daughter. My daughter.\n[Indistinct conversations]\nMrs. Hale: She's improved.\nMr. Hale: [Sighs]\nI never understood it before... how my parents could send me away. What could be worse than being apart? Certainly not death. Now I know a parent will do anything for the life of their child.\nMrs. Hale: What did you do?\nAnne: What happened?\nMr. Hale: It's all right, darling.\nEverything's going to be all right.\n[Smooches]\n[John groans]\nCotton: A confession...\nI've thought, on occasion, my character might've been improved by the infrequent tussle.\nJohn: Oh, yeah. Beating's done you a world of good.\nWhy did you help me?\nCotton: Even God demands a fair fight.\nMr. Hale: Gentlemen.\nThe selectmen and I feel, in this particular case, that a trial and a vote will be unnecessary. Clearly, the lad was drunk. We are willing to let him go and drop charges. Unless, of course, the Reverend feels otherwise.\nCotton: A drunken romp is all... a young man's prerogative. Why don't you tell him?\nJohn: Well... The good folks of Salem have declared you a drunk and not a witch. You're sprung.\nIsaac: I'm free?\nJohn: Yeah. Get the hell out of here.\nIsaac: Pretty sure no one's ever stood for me before. Makes it hard to know what to say. You saved my life.\nCotton: Excellent news. Isaac has been spared.\nGloriana: What? How?\nCotton: There simply wasn't the required evidence to convict. I told you I was thorough and that the innocent... Have no cause for alarm. Does that not give you peace?\nGloriana: That is today, but what of the days that follow?\nCotton: We will take them as they come.\nGloriana: We will?\nCotton: I told you... no harm will come to you.\nGloriana: You can't be sure.\nCotton: I can.\nGloriana: Do you ever wonder?\nCotton: What?\nGloriana: If we could leave this place?\nIf we could forget Salem and its witches? If we could have a different life?\nCotton: I believe I'm doing good.\nGloriana: I know. And your father would be so very proud.\n[Bell tolling]\nMary: Isaac has been freed?\nJohn: Yes.\nMary: Good.\nJohn: You should see the militia.\nMary: I'm grateful.\nFor Isaac.\nJohn: Okay, then.\nMary: John... We were fortunate today, but we might not be so lucky in days to come.

You're flesh and blood at least.\nPERI: Leave me alone.\nDOCTOR: Oh, that stupid girl's watch. How I hate these hit or miss performances.\nPERI: Doctor, thank heavens, whatever happened?\nDOCTOR: Your watch stopped. I overcompensated, ended up in the wrong time zone. Ten seconds into your future.\nPERI: I thought you'd been killed.\nDOCTOR: You cared?\nPERI: Of course I did.\nDOCTOR: You know I'll never understand the people of earth. I have spent the day using, abusing, even tried to kill you. If you'd behaved as I have, I should have been pleased at your demise.\nPERI: It's called compassion, Doctor. It's the difference that remains between us.\nDOCTOR: Earthlings.\nLT HUGO LANG: Would someone like to tell me what is going on?\nDOCTOR: Ah, Corporal Lang, how are you?\nLT HUGO LANG: Lieutenant. I was fine, I'm not sure any more. My ship.\nDOCTOR: You were lucky to escape, no one else did.\nPERI: I'm sorry. What went wrong?\nLT HUGO LANG: I don't know, the controls seized, after that I don't remember anything til I came to in here. What is this place, who are you?\nPERI: I'm Peri, and this is the Doctor. He saved your life.\nDOCTOR: And we did not abduct the twins.\nLT HUGO LANG: Twins, what do you know about them?\nDOCTOR: Never mind about that now, look, do put that thing away will you? If you ever hope to see them again your only chance is to come with us.\nLT HUGO LANG: Where to?\nDOCTOR At a guess, Jaconda.\nLT HUGO LANG: All right, you don't leave me any choice, do you?\nDOCTOR: Not really.\n(On Jaconda.)\nROMULUS: He was your friend.\nREMUS: That girl did you no harm.\nROMULUS: You've left them there to die.\nAZMAEL: They will survive. Now if you don't mind.\nREMUS: And your name isn't Edgeworth\nROMULUS It's Azmael.\nAZMAEL: Yes, yes, I agree, a small deception, now be patient and sensible.\nDRAK: Master.\nAZMAEL: What is it?\nDRAK: That blip on the scanner.\nAZMAEL: Yes. Very far ahead.\nDRAK: We're on the same course.\nAZMAEL: Oh, some merchant man. No concern of ours.\nNOMA: They will not survive. AZMAEL I don't understand.\nNOMA: The safe house. I set it to self destruct.\nAZMAEL: You madman, I gave no orders!\nNOMA: That is perfectly correct.\nAZMAEL: But it's murder! Why, Noma, why?\nNOMA: It is what the lord Mestor would have wished.\n(Back to the TARDIS.)\nPERI: But why would he want to kill us?\nDOCTOR: I don't know.\nPERI: And if he's going to Jaconda, why stop off Titan Three?\nLT HUGO LANG: Oh, that was just to put us off the scent.\nDOCTOR: No no no no no. No, no. No no nononono. No, consider what we know. Azmael, or whatever he happens to call himself needs the genius of the twins, he crosses galaxies to possess their minds. He says he's no longer master of his planet, but he wants to save his people. And that I cannot help him to do so. Even if he does believe such unimaginable rubbish he must be faced by some unimaginable disaster which has unhinged his mind. Well. We shall soon discover what it is.\n(On Jaconda.)\nMESTOR: Who is this creature?\nCHAMBERLAIN: A porter from the royal hatcheries, Master.\nMESTOR: What is his crime?\nCHAMBERLAIN: After routine search following his tour of duty, he was found to have this concealed on his person.\nMESTOR: What does it contain?\nCHAMBERLAIN: Vegetables from the royal hatcheries, Master\nMESTOR: The penalty is death. Have you anything to say?\nPRISONER: Mercy, great Master, mercy! My family is starving.\nMESTOR: Many are starving, it is no difference. Now your family will have to starve without your company. Stand aside, guards. You will suffer the maximum penalty - death by embolism.\nPRISONER: No, no not that. Shoot me! Ah! Aaaaaagghh!\nMESTOR: Cold storage. ** CLAP ON! ** The carcass may be of use to our slaves if this famine continues. Azmael will soon be here?\nCHAMBERLAIN: Yes, Master.\nMESTOR: When he arrives, have him escorted to his laboratory with the earthlings. I will see him there.\n(On the surface. The TARDIS materializes.)\nDOCTOR: Haaaa. Jaconda the beautiful.\nPERI: You call this beautiful? Doctor, it's absolutely ghastly!\nDOCTOR: Oh no. It should not be true. The giant gastropods.\nLT HUGO LANG: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: Half humanoid, half slug, part of Jacondan mythology.\nPERI: So?\nDOCTOR: Well, just look around you, look at the devastation.\nPERI: Gastropods did this?\nDOCTOR What else?\nPERI: Are you sure your mind isn't wandering again?\nDOCTOR: Of course not. So, it wasn't a myth after all. Somewhere somehow their seed survived. Now they have returned.\nLT HUGO LANG: Nonsense.\nDOCTOR: You think so?\nLT HUGO LANG: Well of course it is.\nDOCTOR: I wish I could agree with you. This was once a forest grove. Look at the trees! No trace of foliage. The very bark stripped of the trunks. And the soil! Barren. Nothing but these telltale tracks. The slime trails of the giant gastropods. I fear the evidence is quite conclusive.\nPERI: Doctor. You're beginning to scare me.\nDOCTOR: I'm beginning to scare myself, Peri.\nPERI: Now what?\nDOCTOR: Into the TARDIS. I must think.\n(On the freighter.)\nAZMAEL: Freighter to Jaconda control. Freight to Jaconda control.\nFLIGHT CONTROLLER: Receiving you freighter.\nAZMAEL: Approaching re-entry, permission to touch down at omega intersection.\nFLIGHT CONTROLLER: You are clear to approach.\nAZMAEL: Thank you control.\nFLIGHT CONTROLLER: On arrival report to palace. Transport will be waiting. Out.\n(In the TARDIS.)\nPERI: What are you gonna do?\nDOCTOR: Panic at any moment.\nLT HUGO LANG: Where is Edgeworth likely to have taken the twins?\nDOCTOR: The palace.\nLT HUGO LANG: Well shouldn't we go there?\nDOCTOR: And be killed?\nLT HUGO LANG: Just give me directions and I'll go alone, if you're afraid.\nDOCTOR: Me, afraid?\nLT HUGO LANG Well, aren't you?\nDOCTOR: You have a nasty habit of pinpointing the truth, young man.\nPERI: We we we can't let him go alone! DOCTOR Watch me.\nPERI: Well you know what's out there, he doesn't!\nDOCTOR: Well then let him go to the palace, and he'll know as much as I do.\nPERI: Oh Doctor you must help.\nDOCTOR: Is this another attempt to teach me compassion?\nLT HUGO LANG: Just tell me where it is and I'll be happy to go alone.\nDOCTOR: It's all right for you! You're young, strong, fit of limb.You're confident in your mission,your energy's boundless, you're highly motivated to success. You even have a gun to enforce your will upon others. Look at me, I'm old, lacking in vigour, my mind's in a turmoil, I no longer know if I'm coming, have gone or even been. I'm falling to pieces! I no longer even have any clothes sense!\nPERI: Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself!\nDOCTOR: Self pity is all I have left.\nPERI: You've got the TARDIS. You still know how to operate it. Take the Lieutenant to the palace!\nLT HUGO LANG: Now, if you please.\nDOCTOR: As you wish.\n(Underground.)\nPERI: That's the seediest looking stately home I've ever seen.\nDOCTOR: Well you didn't expect me to materialise in the throne room.\nLT HUGO LANG: Where are the twins likely to be?\nDOCTOR: Anywhere.\nLT HUGO LANG: Well, I won't find them waiting around here.\nDOCTOR: I'll come with you.\nLT HUGO LANG: No need, thank you for bringing me here.\nDOCTOR: You didn't give me much choice! Now look, Sergeant -\nPERI: Lieutenant.\nDOCTOR AND LT HUGO LANG Lieutenant.\nDOCTOR: Don't be smug with me. Now I've already explained my condition, I may be behaving like a manic barometer, but don't shrug off help when it's offered. You can't afford to.\nLT HUGO LANG: I thank you for your offer, but frankly I find you unreliable.\nDOCTOR: So is most currency. Doesn't stop people from spending money wisely.\nPERI: The Doctor might be useful.\nLT HUGO LANG: Well, all right. But if you become unstable again, Doctor, I won't hesitate to kill you.\n(After the freighter lands.)\nROMULUS: Where are you taking us?\nAZMAEL: You'll see.\nREMUS: Why do you like to play the man of mystery?\nROMULUS: It's a role you play very badly.\nREMUS It's so blatantly transparent.\nAZMAEL: Continue to provoke me and the matter that contains your genius will finish up as so much animal fodder!\n(Back to the Doctor.)\nDOCTOR: Hideous. Utterly hideous!\nPERI: Are you sure this is the right place?\nDOCTOR: Hm? Absolutely. Azmael showed me once. This passage leads to the center of the palace. Used to be an underground bolthole in times of danger. Ah, seems to be clear. Shall we go?\nPERI: I just hope you don't get us lost.\n(To Azmael.)\nDOCTOR: Oh, definite possibility that.\nAZMAEL: This is where I work. The palace laboratory.\nCHAMBERLAIN: Greetings.\nROMULUS What's in there?\nAZMAEL: Eggs. You're looking at Lord Mestor's incubator. The future citizens of Jaconda.\nREMUS: They're gastropod eggs.\nCHAMBERLAIN: Such knowledge.\nROMULUS: Who is this?\nAZMAEL: One of Lord Mestor's lackeys.\nCHAMBERLAIN: Not quite, Azmael. I am a humble servant of the Lord Mestor. I am his Chamberlain. Welcome to the planet Jaconda. I will inform the Lord Mestor of your safe arrival.\nAZMAEL: If you must, do so.\nCHAMBERLAIN: It's my duty, he's commanded me.\nAZMAEL: Well hurry then. And you too, Noma.\nNOMA: No I must remain, I too have been commanded.\nAZMAEL: One day you will discover for yourselves that treason is universal. Let it not concern you now. And don't be afraid of what lies in store for us.\n(Back to the Doctor.)\nDOCTOR: This way. Come along. Ah, there they are. I don't know how old they are, but they tell the whole story. The Queen of Jaconda offended the sun god. This way. He inflicted a terrible revenge. He sent a creature, half humanoid, half slug. This creature's offspring were numberless. They ravaged the planet, the population starved. When he saw what he'd done the sun god relented. He sent a drought which destroyed the slugs. The people of Jaconda survived. That's the story as Azmael related it.\nPERI: Now what do you think?\nDOCTOR: It was more truth than myth. I think some dormant eggs survived.\nPERI: For how long?\nDOCTOR: Too long, it seems. Shut off the torch. Listen.\nPERI: What is it?\nDOCTOR: The sound of giant slugs.\nLT HUGO LANG: What a stench!\nDOCTOR: Their gastric tracts. Rotting vegetables.\nPERI: Or rotting flesh.\nLT HUGO LANG: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Whatever is it now?\nLT HUGO LANG: I'm ... I'm stuck!\nDOCTOR: Oh no, I should have thought of that! Their slime trails harden like concrete, only far faster.\nLT HUGO LANG: Well never mind that, just get me out of it, you!\nDOCTOR: Easier said than done.\nPERI Well we can't leave him here.\nLT HUGO LANG: Maybe if I turn my gun down low I can melt the stuff.\nDOCTOR: Oh, if you like, but try not to burn your feet off.\n(To Azmael.)\nMESTOR: So these are your prodigies. They seem quite insignificant.\nAZMAEL: Their brains are not.\nMESTOR: We shall see. Have you told them why we need them?\nAZMAEL: Not in detail. So far they've simply worked to orders.\nMESTOR: I suggest that you do tell them. If they know that our purpose is benevolent, they may prove to be less intransigent.\nAZMAEL: Very well.\nMESTOR: How far advanced are you?\nAZMAEL: We need another day.\nMESTOR: Very well, I will leave you.\nAZMAEL: Mestor. Do not monitor my thoughts.\nMESTOR: Why not?\nAZMAEL: It interferes with my concentration.\nMESTOR: They may be treasonable thoughts.\nAZMAEL: There can be no treason without fellow conspirators, and aI have none. You control the minds of all my most faithful subjects.\nMESTOR: I do not trust you.\nAZMAEL: A mistake, Mestor. The last hope for my people is the success of this undertaking. I wouldn't allow my personal loathing for you to interfere with that.\nMESTOR: Very well.\nAZMAEL: Remove Noma, too.\nNOMA: Master.\nMESTOR: Until your work is done.\nAZMAEL: They don't trust you, either, that's why they've left you here, to see the measure of your treachery.\nDRAK: But I'm not a traitor.\nAZMAEL: True, but I believe they think you are my friend.\nDRAK: I would value your friendship.\nAZMAEL It could cost you your life.\nDRAK: I could think of worse reasons for dying.\nAZMAEL: Thank you. Now. Pay attention. That is our sun, that is Jaconda. Those are two lesser planets. Now I once ruled Jaconda, but now Mestor has usurped me. His kind takes all and gives nothing, there is nothing left for my people.\nREMUS: What are we supposed to do?\nAZMAEL: Help me to provide the only possible solution.\nROMULUS: You'd better tell us what it is.\nAZMAEL: We need new sources of supply. And we're going to bring those two planets into orbit around Jaconda.\nTWINS: What?\nAZMAEL: Oh yes. And then they will have the same atmospheres and climates, they will be the larders of Jaconda. Everything is in readiness. All we lack is what you two possess, that mathematical delicacy that will stabilise those two planets in their new orbit.\n(Back to the Doctor.)\nDOCTOR: Now, let me see. We follow this passage to the end, flight of steps up to the palace hall, doorway at the left just up at the top. Yes, that's it. Private doorway into the back of his laboratory. That's where he's bound to be.\nPERI: Who?\nDOCTOR: What?\nPERI: Who will be there?\nDOCTOR: Me. Once I can get away from this fool. Will you hurry up?\nLT HUGO LANG: I'm doing the best I can.\nDOCTOR: Well it's not good enough! Look what you've done you stupid girl, you've ruined everything!\nPERI: It wasn't my fault!\nDOCTOR: Of course it was your fault, sheer carelessness! Switching off that torch when you did, don't argue with me!\nPERI: I will! I'm not letting a manic depressive paranoid personality like you shut me up!\nDOCTOR: Manic depressive! Me!\nPERI: Well can't you hear yourself? You're having another of your fits!\nDOCTOR: Right that's it, I'm off!\nLT HUGO LANG Calm down, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Calm down? Calm da, calm down? The fate of a whole planet hanging in the balance and he tells me to calm down.\nLT HUGO LANG: Look, I'll be free in a moment.\nDOCTOR: Oh, fend for yourselves! PERI Oh, Doctor!\nLT HUGO LANG: Don't waste your breath, we'll manage.\n(Back to Azmael.)\nAZMAEL: Everything is controlled from this panel. When the information you provide has been fed into the computer, we shall operate this switch.\nREMUS: What happens if we refuse to help?\nAZMAEL: Then I shall have to kill you! I've already told you that this is the only way we can save my people.\nROMULUS: Aren't you forgetting the consequence of what you're asking!\nAZMAEL: Look, everything has been considered, how many times must I tell you!\nREMUS: He's mad.\nREMUS: Quite mad.\nROMULUS: Azmael! Edgeworth!\nDOCTOR (OUTSIDE): We won't do it!\nTWINS: You'll do as I tell you!\nAZMAEL: Still bullying children, eh?\n(He enters.)\nDOCTOR: Villain! Murderer!\nDOCTOR: Doctor!\nAZMAEL: (shouts something)\nDOCTOR: That's enough, Doctor!\nAZMAEL:\nDOCTOR: I apologize. However I still would like to know why you tried to murder us.\nDRAK: He didn't.\nROMULUS: He didn't know.\nREMUS: It was Noma.\nAZMAEL: Look, I can't believe it. How did you escape?\nDOCTOR: That doesn't matter now. I think you better tell me what's going on here.\n(Back to Peri.)\nPERI: Pity about your boot.\nLT HUGO LANG: Never mind. Where to now?\nPERI: Find the Doctor.\nLT HUGO LANG: Right.\n(To Mestor.)\nPERI: No! No! Hugo! No! No! No! No!\nMESTOR: Who are these aliens on Titan Three?\nNOMA: A Time Lord and an earth girl.\nMESTOR: And Azmael would have let them live?\nNOMA: Yes.\nMESTOR: But now he knows them to be dead.\nNOMA: He does, I told him so.\nMESTOR: You have done well, Noma.\nNOMA: No more than is my duty.\nMESTOR: What have we here?\nNOMA: Impossible! She must have died!\nMESTOR: Is this the earth girl you say you killed? It seems you have not done so well after all. Where did you find her?\nJACONDAN GUARD: In a passage underneath the palace.\nMESTOR: Alone?\nJACONDAN GUARD: There was another with her. We left him half dead.\nMESTOR: This is a dangerous complication. Fetch him to me. At once! At once!\n(To Azmael and Doctor.)\nAZMAEL: That is the plan. Now what is your opinion?\nDOCTOR: You really intend to put it into operation? You know what'll happen, don't you?\nROMULUS: We've already told him.\nAZMAEL The risks must be taken.\nDOCTOR: This is not a risk, Azmael, this is doomsday! One tiny error in your calculation you'll blow a small hole in the universe.\nLT HUGO LANG: Doctor! Doctor, they've got Peri!\nDOCTOR: Peri? Peri!\nAZMAEL: Stop him!\nDOCTOR: No, leave me, I must go to her!\nAZMAEL: And tell Mestor everything and condemn my plan to certain death?\nDOCTOR: But I must help her!\nAZMAEL: No, Doctor, if necessary she must die.\nDOCTOR: No. Peri!\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Monica is wearing her costume, including big fake breasts.]\nMONICA: So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.\nALL: Ohhh.\nMONICA: What?\nROSS: Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?\nMONICA: You wanna be in charge of the food committee?\nROSS: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?\nJOEY: Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?\nROSS: Yeah.\nPHOEBE: Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.\nMONICA: Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.\n[Joey is staring at Monica's breasts]\nMONICA: Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See [squeezes her breast] honk honk.\nCHANDLER: Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.\nOPENING TITLES\n[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Ross, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are planning Rache's birthday party.]\nROSS: I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.\nMONICA: Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.\nJOEY: Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.\nPHOEBE: Why not her?\nJOEY: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.\nCHANDLER: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.\nMONICA: Joey that is horriable.\nJOEY: Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.\nPHOEBE: I'm sorry, I didn't know.\nJOEY: I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.\n[Rachel enters]\nROSS: Hi honey, how did it go?\nRACHEL: Agh, it was the graduation from hell.\nCHANDLER: Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.\nRACHEL: Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.\nMONICA: So what happened?\nRACHEL: My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.\nPHOEBE: Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.\nMONICA: Well, how bout just her mom?\nCHANDLER: Why her mom?\nMONICA: Cause I already invited her.\nPHOEBE: Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?\nJOEY: Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Chandler, Joey, Monica, and Phoebe are setting up for the party.]\nPHOEBE: Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?\nMONICA: Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.\nCHANDLER: Excuse me?\nMONICA: It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.\nJOEY: Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.\n[knock at the door]\nMONICA: [answers the door] Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?\nMR. GREENE: What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?\nMONICA: No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.\nMR. GREENE: Ohhh, you're having a parteee.\nMONICA: No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.\nMR. GREENE: I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?\nCHANDLER: This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?\n[knock at the door, Monica answers to see Mrs. Greene]\nMRS. GREENE: Hi Monica.\n[Monica slams the door back shut]\nMONICA: Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.\nCHANDLER: So, basically just a Chinese guy.\nJOEY: Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.\nMR. GREENE: Alright, that sounds like a two person job. [they walk into Rachel's bedroom]\nMRS. GREENE: Well, my goodness, what was that?\nMONICA: Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.\nMRS. GREENE: You thought I was Rachel?\nCHANDLER: Yes because uh, you look so young.\nPHOEBE: And because you're both, you know, white women.\nMRS. GREENE: Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?\nCHANDLER: NO! No, I'll take that for ya.\nMRS. GREENE: Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. [Chandler takes the hot pink coat and grimaces at it] Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... [Chandler, remembering that Joey and Mr. Greene are in the bedroom, throws her coat in a cupboard] The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...[Joey peeks out]\nPHOEBE: [cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. [they go in the bathroom]\nMONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.\nCHANDLER: Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?\nJOEY: [peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.\nMONICA: So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.\nCHANDLER: Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?\nMONICA: Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.\nJOEY: Right this is staging.\nCHANDLER: Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.\nJOEY: [as they're walking out, Dr. Greene questioningly gestures at the Happy Birthday sign over the door] This is clearly in the wrong apartment. [they all walk across the hall]\n[Scene: Later on in the hallway between the apartments. Chandler is showing people to the parties.]\nCHANDLER: Alright you guys are off to party number one [ushers 3 guys into Monica's apartment] and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his apartment. Two guys try to follow and Chandler blocks them and shoos them off to Monica's apartment] Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.\nMONICA: Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? [buzzer goes off] Alright that's Ross.\nCHANDLER: Ok, they're coming, shhh. [Runs into Monica's apartment and grabs one last girl to take to his apartment]\nRACHEL: Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.\nROSS: Thanks for being born.\nRACHEL: Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.\nROSS: Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.\nRACHEL: Now I love you even more.\n[they kiss and Ross backs her into her apartment and turns on the lights]\nALL: Surprise.\nRACHEL: Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.\nMRS. GREENE: Happy birthday sweetie.\nRACHEL: Wow you, you. I had no idea.\nROSS: Really?\nRACHEL: No, I knew.\nROSS: All right.\nMONICA: Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.\nROSS: What?\nRACHEL: What?\nMONICA: Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.\nRACHEL: Why.\nMONICA: Just go.\n[they walk across the hall]\nALL: Surprise.\nMR. GREENE: Happy birthday sweetpea.\nRACHEL: Daddy.\n[Ad break. Time lapse. Still at party at Chandler and Joey's. Rachel is talking to Chandler and Ross.]\nRACHEL: Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?\nCHANDLER: Well, we could count again.\nRACHEL: I can't believe this is happening.\nROSS: You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.\nRACHEL: I do.\nROSS: That's who.\nCHANDLER: Look, are you gonna be ok?\nRACHEL: Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.\nCHANDLER: Well, actually just one birthday flan.\nRACHEL: What?\nCHANDLER: It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.\n[Time lapse. Chandler runs out of the bathroom.]\nCHANDLER: Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.\nJOEY: Quick volleyball question.\nCHANDLER: Volleyball.\nJOEY: Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?\nCHANDLER: Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.\nGIRL'S VOICE: Dennis.\nCHANDLER: Ok, that's me. [runs back]\nRACHEL: Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.\nROSS: Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?\nRACHEL: Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.\n[Back in Monica's party]\nMONICA: Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.\n[Back in Chandler and Joey's party]\nROSS: Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?\nMR. GREENE: It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.\nROSS: I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.\n[Back in Monica's party]\nMONICA: Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. [she demonstrates, Gunther starts to walk to the door] Gunther, where're you going?\nGUNTHER: I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...\nMONICA: No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.\nPHOEBE: Listen if you wanna go, just go.\nGUNTER: No, she'll yell at me again.\nPHOEBE: Alright, I can get you out.\nGUNTHER: What?\nPHOEBE: Shh.

You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.\nGIRL 1: Is it true they have beer?\nPHOEBE: Everything you've heard is true.\n[Back at Chandler and Joey's party. Everyone is dancing and having fun.]\nMONICA: Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.\n[Chandler and Joey stop dancing and laugh at her]\nMONICA: You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party.

They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.\nMONICA: Ya know, my party is fun.

[volleyball hits her in the head from behind]\n[Back at Monica's party]\nRACHEL: You want me to see a therapist?\nMRS. GREENE: Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem.

She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?\nCHANDLER: Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.\nRACHEL: Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.\nCHANDLER: Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?\nRACHEL: It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...\nCHANDLER: I, I know. [Hugs her. Ross walks out and Chandler puts her in his arms.]\n[Scene: Monica's party.

Uncle Marshall still refers to it as the pineapple incident.\nThe night started like any other. We were downstairs at the bar.\nINT. MACLAREN'S\n(Lily, Marshall, Ted, Robin and Barney sit at booth, Carl comes over with drinks)\nCarl: On the house.\nEveryone: Whoa.\nCarl: It's my own concoction. I call it the Red Dragon.\nEveryone: Wow. Thanks, Carl.\n(Carl walks away)\nTed: We're not really doing shots, are we?\nLily: I hope not.\nBarney: No, no.\nLily: These look kinda like blood.\nMarshall: OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?\nBarney: That's ridiculous.\nMarshall: I'm serious. Think about it. He always wears black, we never see him in the daylight, only after dark.\nRobin: Oh my God, that does describe a vampire, or you know, a bartender.\n(Everyone but Marshall laughs)\nRobin: Well, I should go get dressed.\nTed: Where are you going, buddy? Hot date?\nLily: I'll say, she's going out with a billionaire.\nRobin: Lily, I told you not to call him that.\nTed: Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire?\nRobin: He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred millionaire. Why do people always round up?\nTed: So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you?\nRobin: A charity dinner.\nLily: Yeah, $2000 a plate.\nRobin: $1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger.\nBarney: You gonna put out?\n(Everyone looks at Barney incredulously)\nBarney: What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills.\nLily: I think my soul just threw up a little bit.\nRobin: Well, I'm gonna be late. You guys have fun. Bye.\n(Robin gets up and leaves)\nTed: See ya.\nLily: Bye.\nMarshall: You OK?\nTed: Sure, why?\nMarshall: I don't know. Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.\nTed: OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for...\n(Barney starts snoring, Ted stops talking)\nBarney: What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.\n(Barney stands up)\nTed: Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?\nBarney: Daddy's home.\nTed: Daddy's home?\nBarney: Yeah.\nTed: You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney.\nBarney: Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.\n(Barney walks away from their booth over to table four)\nMarshall: OK, think about this, is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it?\nLily: Garlic fries.\nMarshall: OK, well, I'll get back to you.\n(Barney walks back to their booth)\nTed: Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...\nBarney: (holding up small yellow piece of paper) Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh?\nTed: That worked. I hate the world.\nBarney: Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.\nMarshall: Doo-doo.\nBarney: Totally.\nTed: So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.\nBarney: Oh yes it can.\n(Barney puts a shot in front of Ted)\nMarshall: Interesting\nBarney: Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style.\nTed: So, what? You want me to do a shot.\nBarney: Oh no. I want you to do five shots.\nMarshall: Oooh, more interesting.\nTed: Barney, I think you've officially...\nBarney: No, don't think. Do.\nMarshall: Ted, he's right. You overthink. Maybe you should overdrink.\nMarshall, Barney: Drink, drink, drink, drink...\nTed: Ah, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?\nLily: Guys, you are being immature and moronic and drink, drink, drink\nMarshall, Lily, Barney: Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink...\n(Ted takes a shot)\nMarshall, Lily, Barney: Yes! Drink, drink, drink...\nTed: Let me tell you something about this brain, OK?\n(Ted takes second shot)\nMarshall, Lily, Barney: Drink! Drink, drink...\nTed: Even alcohol cannot stop this brain.\n(Ted takes third shot)\nBarney: I love it, I love it, I love it.\nMarshall, Lily: Drink, drink, drink...\nTed: This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain.\n(Ted takes fourth shot)\nMarshall, Lily, Barney: Drink, drink, drink, drink...\nTed: This is a superbrain.\n(Ted takes fifth shot)\nTed: This brain is unstoppable. This brain...\n(screen blacks out)\nFuture Ted VO: And that's all I remember, except for a few hazy memories.\n(black screen with white swirls spinning around and fire on the side, pineapple spins around, the words, \"I am Ted, please call\" spin around)\nFuture Ted VO: But really, the next thing I remember is waking up the following morning.\nINT. TED'S BEDROOM\n(Ted lying in bed rolls over to his right side to see pineapple on his bedside table, gets up slightly looking surprised, rubs side of head and gets up and notices girl sleeping next to him on other side)\nFuture Ted VO: So, there were some unanswered questions.\n(Ted sits up in bed and puts on some sweatpants)\nFuture Ted VO: How much did I drink? How did I sprain my ankle?\n(Ted gets up and grabs left ankle in pain)\nFuture Ted VO: And who was this girl in my bed?\nINT. APARTMENT\n(Lily and Marshall sitting in living room area, Ted walks in from his room) Lily: There's our rock star\nTed: OK, what the hell happened last night?\nMarshall: You really don't remember, Superbrain?\nFuture Ted VO: So, Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily filled me in.\n(flashback to previous evening at bar, Marshall, Lily, Barney and Ted sit at booth, Carl walks over)\nCarl: And how did you guys like the shots?\nTed: I drank all five, bitch.\nMarshall: (laughing) I love drunk Ted.\nTed: Marshall thinks you're a vampire.\n(Marshall laughs and then gives Ted a stern look)\nCarl: If he pukes, one of you guys cleans it up.\n(Carl walks away)\nLily: No dibs. (Lily puts index finger on her nose)\nMarshall: Oh. (Marshall puts index finger on his nose)\n(Barney moves top put his index finger on his nose)\nBarney: No....Dammit.\nTed: How quickly you all forget. I haven't puked since high school. I am vomit-free since ninety-three. Vomit free since ninety-three. That's funny. I'm funny.\n(Ted gets his cell phone out)\nLily: Who are you calling?\nTed: Robin.\nMarshall: Oh, bad idea.\nBarney: No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober.\nLily: Says every girl you've ever slept with.\n(Lily puts her hand up for a high-five from Barney)\nMarshall: (pointing to Lily) Say what?!\n(Barney shakes his head, Lily puts her hand down)\nTed: Hello Robin, it's Ted.\n(Robin sitting in back of limo dressed up, talking on phone with Ted)\nRobin: Oh hi Ted.\n(Ted on phone)\nTed: Hello Robin, it's Ted.\n(Robin on phone)\nRobin: Hi Ted. Sounds like you're having fun.\nTed on phone)\nTed: Robin, have I ever told you that I'm vomit-free since ninety-three?\n(Robin on phone)\nRobin: Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right... '93? Dude, that's impressive.\n(Ted on phone)\nTed: I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter. You should be on 60 Minutes. You should be one of the minutes.\n(Robin on phone)\nRobin: That's sweet and odd. But I'm kinda on a date right now.\n(Ted on phone)\nTed: Yeah, and I disagree with Barney. Just 'cause this guy is spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out. Take it slow, Robin, take it slow. Slow.\n(Robin on phone)\nRobin: Bye Ted.\n(Ted on phone)\nTed: Slow.\n(Lily takes away Ted's phone)\nMarshall: Wow, right, that's why we don't do shots.\nLily: Friends don't let friends drink and dial.\nTed: I need that phone back.\nLily: You'll get this back at the end of class.\nBarney: Ding, class dismissed. Here you go, kid, you call whoever you want.\n(Barney takes phone from Lily and returns it to Ted)\nTed: Thank you kind sir. At least someone appreciates the fact that I'm doing and not thinking. And now I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom.\n(Ted walks away)\nLily: Was that necessary? He is not making smart decisions. Barney: Exactly. It's like, what's he gonna do next. I don't know, but I want to find out.\n(Cheap Trick's \"Voices\" starts playing on the jukebox)\nMarshall: Cheap Trick? Oh Ted.\n(Robin in car, her phone rings, she answers)\nRobin: Hello again, Ted.\n(Ted on phone singing along with jukebox)\nTed: Hey, it's me again.\n(Robin on phone smiles)\nTed: (singing along with jukebox) Plain to see again.\n(Ted jumps up on table)\nTed: (singing along with jukebox) Please can I see you every day?\nTed: (yelling to everyone in bar) I love everyone in this bar.\nMarshall: And we love you, drunk Ted.\nTed: (singing along with jukebox) I'm a fool again.\n(Robin in car on phone with mouth wide open)\nTed: (singing along with jukebox) I fell in love...\n(Ted falls off table)\n(Robin on phone)\nRobin: Ted?\n(back to present scene in apartment)\nTed: Well, that explains the ankle.\nLily: And then we brought you home and put you to bed.\nTed: Was there anyone else in there with me?\n(Lily and Marshall get up and run over to Ted's bedroom door, Ted limps behind them, Lily opens door and she and Marshall peek in room to see girl lying on bed, Lily closes the door)\nLily: There's a girl in there.\nTed: I know.\nMarshall: And a pineapple.\nTed: I know.\nLily: Who is she?\nTed: I don't know.\n(Ted sees his jacket burnt)\nTed: What the hell happened to my jacket? Marshall: Whoa.\nLily: That girl in there is alive, right? Ted: I should call Barney, maybe he knows what happened.\n(Marshall gets his phone out of his pocket and dials and gives to Ted, sound of phone ringing from bathroom, Lily, Ted and Marshall walk into the bathroom, Lily pulls curtain aside to find Barney lying in the tub)\nBarney: Hello.\nTed: Why are you sleeping in our tub?\nBarney: The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling.\nLily: Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?\nBarney: Don't worry, I slept through it. (laughs) I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big tank.\nMarshall: How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one.\nBarney: Oh, you put Ted to bed all right.\n(flashback to Marshall and Lily putting Ted to bed)\nTed: You guys take care of me. You guys are the best. I love you guys so much.\nLily: Good night, Ted.\nMarshall: Love you too, buddy.\n(Lily turns out light, Marshall and Lily leave Ted's bedroom and close door, Ted asleep on his bed)\n(Ted enters MacLaren's)\nTed: I'm back baby doll!\nBarney: Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now.\n(Barney and Ted high-five)\nBarney: All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one?\nTed: I think....\nBarney: Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride.\nTed: Bring it.\n(Barney walks over to table and sits down next to girl, Ted walks in another direction)\nBarney: Have you met Ted?\n(Barney gestures behind him and finds that Ted's not there, sees Ted standing by jukebox with his phone) Barney: Excuse me.\n(Barney walks over to Ted)\nBarney: You're calling Robin.\nTed: I'm calling Robin.\nBarney: Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.\nTed: Oh yeah? What you gonna do?\nBarney: If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire.\nTed: You're bluffing.\n(Ted completes call to Robin)\nTed: Hello, Robin, it's Ted.\n(Robin at dinner, answers phone)\nRobin: Ted, for the last time, stop.\n(Robin hears Ted screaming)\nRobin: Ted!\n(back to present scene at apartment, Ted, Barney, Lily and Marshall sit around living room)\nTed: You set me on fire.\nBarney: Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast. You got robbed, this is a blend.\nTed: You set me on fire. And who's the girl in my bed?\n(Barney looks at Lily and Marshall and Ted, stumbles over to Ted's room and peeks in, closes door and stumbles back to living room) Barney: There's a girl in your bed.\nMarshall: And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?\nBarney: Who is she?\nTed: I have no idea.\nBarney: Nice.\nTed: You really don't know who that is?\nBarney: No, after I hosed you down with a beverage gun, I brought you back here.\nTed: I better not have gotten burned.\n(Ted pulls up sleeves to check his skin, notices writing on his right arm)\nTed: Did any of you write that?\nLily: (reading what's on Ted's arm) Hi, I'm Ted, if lost, please call...Who's number is that?\nTed: I don't know.\nMarshall: Dude, call it.

MACLAREN'S\n(Carl on phone)\nCarl: It's Carl, from the bar.\nINT. APARTMENT\n(Ted on phone)\nFuture Ted VO: And then Carl filled us in.\n(flashback to Barney putting Ted to bed)\nTed: Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar.

My name is Trudy.\nFuture Ted VO: And then Trudy filled us in.\n(flashback to previous evening at bar, Trudy sitting at booth with three girlfriends)\nTrudy's friend: I'm just surprised you didn't dump him sooner.\nTrudy: I know, it's two years of my life I'm never getting back. A little part of me just wants to jump the bones of the next guy I see.\n(Barney walks over)\nBarney: Daddy's home.\nTrudy: Or the one after that.\nBarney: OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy.\n(Barney takes out yellow paper and pen from inside jacket pocket, scribbles on paper)\nBarney: Ladies.\n(Barney puts pen back in his pocket and walks away)\n(flash forward to Ted standing on table while singing)\nTed: I love everyone in this bar.\nTrudy's friend: Look at that idiot go.\nTrudy: He's kinda cute.\n(Ted falls down and Trudy and her friends laugh)\n(flash forward to Trudy washing her hands in the ladies room, Ted walks out of stall)\nTed: What are you doing in the men's room? What am I doing in the ladies' room? Oh right, I came in here 'cause I thought I was gonna throw up.\nTrudy: Did you?\nTed: I did not.\n(back to present scene)\nTed: And the streak continues. Vomit-free since '93.\n(Ted and Marshall high-five)\nTed: Sorry, Trudy, go on.\n(flashback to Trudy and Ted in ladies room)\nTrudy: I liked your performance.\nTed: What? The karaoke? Domo arigato.\nTrudy: I wish I had your guts, getting up and making a complete idiot of myself.\nTed: Do it.\nTrudy: I don't know. Still, I've had a pretty serious week. I could sure stand to do something stupid.\nTed: I'm something stupid, do me.\nTrudy: You're funny.\nTed: Hey, can I call you sometime? Trudy: OK.\n(Ted gets his phone out) Trudy: Here, let me.\n(Trudy takes it and puts her phone number in)\nTed: Why do they call it karaoke anyhow? Was it invented by a woman named Carrie Okie? These are the kinds of things I think about. Trudy: Karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra.\nTed: That's hauntingly beautiful.\n(Ted presses send and Trudy's phone rings)\nTed: Hey, it works.\nTrudy: Then I guess you're gonna have to call me.\n(Trudy walks out of ladies room)\n(flash forward to Ted and Carl talking at bar)\nTed: I need to make one more call.\n(Ted gets phone out, cut to Trudy sitting in back of cab, her phone rings and she answers)\nTrudy: Hello.\n(screen divides into two with Trudy talking on phone on left side, Ted on phone on right side)\nTed: Hey, it's me again.\nTrudy: Hey.\nTed: Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life.\n(back to present scene, Ted, Barney, Lily and Marshall listen to Trudy telling story in living room)\nTrudy: So I came over here. And now I'm really, really embarrassed.\nMarshall: Dammit, Trudy, what about the pineapple? Sorry.\n(knock on door)\nTed: Uh, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.\n(Ted grabs Trudy's hand and drags her to his room)\nTrudy: Why, is that your girlfriend?\nTed: No, that's not my girlfriend. Look, it's complicated.\nTrudy: You're married. Yeah, I can't believe I did this.\nTed: No, I'm not married. Um, I'll explain after you hide.\n(Trudy goes into Ted's room, Ted goes over and opens front door)\nTed: Hi.\nRobin: Hey guys.\nBarney: Robin.\nLily: Hi Robin.\nBarney: Top of the morning.\nTed: Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk.\nRobin: No kidding. Those calls were really weird. Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.\nLily: Let's go get a snack.\n(Lily stands up)\nMarshall: I love to snack.\n(Marshall stands up)\nBarney: I'm good.\n(Lily pulls Barney up, Marshall, Lily and Barney walk over to kitchen)\nTed: Come on, those calls weren't that weird.\n(Robin clears her throat, gets her phone out of her purse, presses button and phone replays Ted's call to Robin)\nTed: (recording form phone) Robin! Come hang out! OK, I'm gonna make this sound until you come hang out.\n(Ted makes weird sound)\nRobin: That goes on for three-and a half minutes.\nTed: Without a breath? That's gotta be some kind of record.\nRobin: Ted, you can't do this. Please, we're to be friends and now you're making it all confusing.\nTed: No I'm not. Look, I just turned off my brain for the night. Nothing's changed, you've moved on, I've moved on.\nRobin: Really, you moved on?\nTed: Yes. What, you don't believe me?\n(Robin exhales)\nTed: Oh, OK.\n(Ted limps over to his room)\nTed: Trudy, come on out.\n(Ted points to Robin) Ted: You are gonna laugh.\nRobin: Wait, you were with someone last night? Ted: Yeah, Trudy, she's cool.\n(Ted knocks on his bedroom door)\nTed: Trudy, come on out.\n(Robin walks over to Ted)\nTed: Seriously, it's OK. This is so Trudy. She's really shy, I think.\n(Ted opens door)\nTed: Trudy?\nINT. TED'S BEDROOM\n(Ted and Robin enter to find room empty, Robin walks over to pineapple)\nRobin: Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy.\nTed: I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape.\n(Robin looks at Ted incredulously)\nTed: Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think.\nRobin: Then why did you hide her from me? Ted: Wow, you're good. Did anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes?\nRobin: Yes, you did, last night.\nTed: Really? Well.\nRobin: Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night. And don't feel bad, I've woken up with worse.\n(Robin walks out of his room, Ted sits down on bed and lies back)\nFuture Ted VO: I left Trudy a message but she never called me back. That's just how life works sometimes. You turn off your brain for a night, and all you're left with is a bad hangover, a sprained ankle.\n(Ted looks at pineapple)\nINT. APARTMENT\n(Barney, Robin, Lily, Ted and Marshall sit around table eating pineapple)\nFuture Ted VO: Oh, and we never found out where that pineapple came from, but it was delicious.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

        "prompt_0": "[PREVIOUSLY_ON]\nJulian : I decided not to produce the movie. There's this girl that... I'm kind of in love with, and... I couldn't be away from her for another day.\nHaley : I know the label's gonna run a lot smoother with you at the helm.\nMiranda : I'm not here to run the label. I'm here to close it.\nMouth : You're mad because I want you to move out, but it's only because I'm trying to step things up with Millie.\nSkills : You trying to get rid of me with your naked ass. It ain't gonna work.\nQuinn : You know earlier when... when I said I miss David?\nHaley : What happened, Quinn? You said he...\nQuinn : I left him.\nClay : Does that girl look familiar to you?\nNathan : Yeah, she was at the party today. Why?\nClay : She says she slept with you on the road, Nate, and she's going public.\nAT BROOKE'S HOUSE\nMan : And where will you run... back to the life of a peasant harlot?\nAlex : Perhaps I will. But should I return to a life of more meager means, I will do so with my dignity intact, my heart pure and true.\nMan : And yet you had no dignity nor purity in my bed a fortnight ago.\nAlex : Meager means, indeed.\nMan : Harlot! Leave the dress!\nBrooke : Millie was right. Alex Dupré is the perfect choice to be the face of the new campaign. She's smart. She's talented. She is crazy beautiful. Julian?\nJulian : I'm shaving!\nBrooke : How come this movie never came out?\nJulian : Because smart and talented and beautiful got all hopped up on goofballs and had to be checked into rehab. By the way, those dailies are top secret. I had to call in about a dozen favors to get 'em.\nBrooke : Aww, my baby's so good to me. Damn. I am really gonna like this living-together thing. I want you to move your stuff in, okay? This is our house now, not just mine.\nJulian : Good. Well, then how would you feel about going back to our bedroom for a little while?\nBrooke : I'd make a joke about meager means, but... it would simply be untrue.\nON THE BEACH\nClay : Hey. You know I'm not judging you, right?\nNathan : Clay, listen, man, you've known me for a long time now. I don't care what that woman says. I did not sleep with her, all right?\nClay : All right.\nNathan : It's unbelievable to me that she could just show up and spout a bunch of lies, and the next thing you know, I'm in the headlines, my family's in the headlines, and I'm guilty before I'm innocent.\nClay : Don't freak out. You're not in the headlines yet. And believe it or not, this kind of thing, it happens a lot. You're a public figure, and they know you make a lot of money.\nNathan : I'm in a contract year, Clay.\nClay : I know. So, here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna stay in shape, you're gonna stay focused, and you're gonna let me handle it. All right?\nNathan : All right.\n*yeah*\nAT SCOTT'S HOUSE\nHaley : It has been ringing off the hook.\n*waves crash along*\nHaley : Quinn, what happened? I mean, what actually happened between you and David?\nQuinn : He just changed, you know? I mean, he used to see the world exactly the way I saw it. He just doesn't anymore.\nHaley : But he still loves you.\nQuinn : I know. But I don't know if that's enough.\nHaley : I'm sorry. I got to go. I got to go down to the studio and take care of this whole \"shutting us down\" mess.\nQuinn : Do you need my help?\nHaley : No. You just stay here and enjoy your day. I'll see you later.\nQuinn : Okay.\nHaley : It's gonna be okay, Quinn.\nQuinn : I love you.\nHaley : I love you, too. *keep your hello* *don't think about it at all*\nAT MOUHT'S APPARTMENT\nMillicent : Is it okay?\nSkills : You're good.\nMillicent : Damn it, Skills!\nSkills : What up, Millie?\nMillicent : You and Marvin need to stop this ridiculous naked standoff!\nSkills : Hey, look, he started it, trying to get me to move out.\nMillicent : Okay, look... I'm going to pick up Alex Dupré from the airport. I'm gonna work a full day, and when I get home, you two idiots better have your pants on!\nIN THE CAR\nJamie : So, what are you gonna do?\nSkills : I ain't moving out. That's for sure.\nJamie : Why not? If Chester hopped around without his fur on, I'd probably move out.\nSkills : Yeah, well, it's a long story. So, you ready for the beach?\nJamie : Totally. You think I can bury you and Miss Lauren in the sand?\nSkills : Cool with me. Oh, and, um, don't tell Miss Lauren about the whole moving-out stuff, all right?\nJamie : Why not?\nSkills : Just don't. Wait. Uh-Oh, here she comes.\nLauren : Hey, boys. Ready for the beach? What are you guys up to?\nSkills : Nothing.\nJamie : Nothing.\nLauren : Huh.\n*that girl's a genius* *whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh*\nTV BROADCAST\nDan : Never believe that you can deceive. You might think that you can get away with it. You might actually get away with it... for a while. But your life is made up of choices and decisions.\nAT BROOKE'S HOUSE\nPaul : Hi, Julian.\nJulian : Dad. What are you doing here?\nPaul : I came to talk you out of the worst decision of your life.\nTV BROADCAST\nDan : Poor choices, poor life. Bad decisions... bad life.\nAT RED BEDROOM RECORDS\nHaley : Come on. Where is it?\nMiranda : Page 7, item 4... It's the part of the contract that basically says we can acquire the label whenever we'd like.\nTV BROADCAST\nDan : Wickedness... As you know, I've been there. I'm not alone. My wife was, too. She was deceptive and manipulative. She abused drink and drugs. She was promiscuous. But today she stands beside me a changed woman, a caring woman, a better woman. Ladies and gentlemen, my wife, and the love of my life.\n*my girl's ready to take control* *she just blows my mind* *she only listens to the radio*\nDan : I love you, honey.\nRachel : I love you, honey. *yeah* *she wakes up scared of getting old*\nAT BROOKE'S HOUSE\nJulian : I didn't make a bad decision, dad.\nPaul : Is that right? You walked away from a potential blockbuster movie days before production, and for what?\nJulian : For love.\nPaul : Love... with Brooke Davis.\nJulian : Be careful, dad.\nPaul : Julian, she's Brooke Davis! I read the tabloids. This is a fling for her, and it could cost you your career!\nJulian : I think you need to leave.\n*behind the tv screen I've fallen to my knees*\nPaul : Your career was one movie away from being prestigious... This movie. And you walk away. For what? A promiscuous fashion designer. *I need to get away* *blanket of silence* *makes me want to sink my teeth in deep* *burn all the evidence*\nAT RED BEDROOM RECORDS\nMiranda : Oh, this glass is gonna look amazing in my loft in Los Angeles.\nHaley : All right, Miranda, I know that you have a legal right to shut down the label, but you don't have to be a total bitch about it.\nMiranda : You're the producer, Haley, and, potentially, a great artist, but you don't have time to record because you're running what is essentially a vanity label.\nHaley : Va... vanity la... You guys would not have Mia Catalano if it wasn't for this label. You wouldn't have had the time or patience or interest to develop an artist like her. That's what small labels do. We develop and nurture artists. It's something corporate labels will never do.\nMiranda : I've always wanted a pool table.\nAT BROOKE'S HOUSE\nBrooke : I can't believe your dad just came all this way to tell you he thinks you're making a mistake. He couldn't call or text or tweet that to you?\nJulian : He's a movie producer, Brooke. He loves the dramatic.\nBrooke : Well, what else did he say?\nJulian : He wanted to know what my game plan was... was I still actively producing, do I have a development staff finding me new properties, and...\nBrooke : That is some poster.\nJulian : What? Oh, right. You like it?\nBrooke : Yeah. It's... different for the living room.\nJulian : He was just so crazy, my father.\nBrooke : Do you think maybe you would like that better in the spare bedroom or in your office? We could get you an office for that.\nJulian : Look, my dad just flew five hours to ask me if I'm quitting the business and getting married.\nBrooke : What did you say?\nJulian : I asked him to leave.\nBrooke : No, about the \"marriage\" part.\nJulian : I told him he was crazy. We're not getting married. We just moved in together. I... I don't... I don't know what the hell got into him.\n*I ain't got no other place to hide* *chained down like a sitting duck* *just waiting for the fall*\nTV BROADCAST\nRachel : Hey, you.\nDan : The clock... it was a good idea. I think it reminds people that every second counts.\nRachel : It's easy. People don't have to work that hard to get it. We have that dinner tonight with the investment guys from Texas. I think you should tell them the whole \"phoenix rising from the ashes\" story. They'll love it.\nDan : It was a good show today. I think we might have reached some people. Do you think it was a good show?\nRachel : I'll let you know after I see the ratings. I got to go.\nDan : Hey. I love you.\nRachel : I know, baby. Wear your gray suit tonight. You always look good in that suit.\nAT THE AEROPORT\nAlex : Guys.\nFan : Right here!\nAlex : Hey. There you go.\nFan : One more.\nTanya : Miss Dupré? Miss dupré? Could I get an autograph?\nAlex : Oh, yeah, sure, you pretty thing. What's your name?\nTanya : Tanya.\nAlex : Tanya?\nTanya : I loved you in \"Heart so true\". You were so brave in that.\nAlex : Oh, thank you, sweetie. But that's just acting. You're the brave one.\nTanya : Thanks.\nAlex : Bye. Bye bye.\nMillicent : Alex, Millicent Huxtable, Clothes Over Bros. Welcome to Tree Hill.\nAlex : Thank you.\nIN THE CAR\nMillicent : Can I just say that I am your biggest fan? And it's because of things like that... that you would take the time to inspire that poor girl in the wheelchair after such a long flight.\nAlex : They kind of creep me out.\nMillicent : What?\nAlex : Cripples and, like, retarded people. They're always, like, drooling and smiling really weird. It's so gross. Water, water, water. Um, is there any wine in here?\nMillicent : Um, I thought you were sober. You just went to rehab.\nAlex : Ugh, do not remind me. They took my phone away. Besides, wine's not even alcohol. It's like grape. Ugh, it's so hot out there. Where the hell are we? It's like the devil's ass in this place. When do I get paid?\nMillicent : I think your agent takes care of that.\nAlex : Can I just tell you... I hate that woman. She's like a complete alcoholic, and her fingers look like chicken feet. Btw, I am starving. Is there any food?\nMillicent : Well, I read that you only eat organic food, so we have an entire organic feast waiting at the hotel.\nAlex : Yeah, I just make that stuff up. Can you drive through a Mickey d's? I could totally eat the butt off a skunk right now.\nMillicent : Um, drive on... please.\nON THE BEACH\nClay : Nate, it's gonna be okay. You know, we haven't heard from this woman since the one e-mail. So, until it's real, it's not real. You know, and besides, who the hell would want to sleep with you, anyway? Okay, I know it's bad timing, but damn.\nNathan : Dude, quit checking out my sister-in-law.\nQuinn : Hey, dumb and dumber.\nClay : Hey.\nQuinn : Nice day, huh?\nNathan : I don't know. Maybe you're right. Maybe it's nothing.\nClay : Actually, uh... now it is something.\nLauren : Hey Jamie can you scratch my noze. Aah, thank you. Oh! My hat!\nJamie : I'll get it.\nLauren : Ohh.\nSkills : Can you move?\nLauren : Not a muscle.\nSkills : Me neither. Man, I hope that knucklehead come back.\nAT RED BEDROOM RECORDS\nHaley : So, listen, Peyton, here's the thing... Uh, you know how I... insisted that you keep that 1 % of the label? Well, it... it kind of killed the label. But, Haley... Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I can see that I'm upsetting you, and I don't want to do that. So, um, let me just, uh... Talk to Lucas. Geez, Haley, I... I... I... I... I don't know, you know? This has really meant a lot to... Peyton. I know. I know. I'm a terrible friend, and there's nothing that I can do unless I... You might be a genius, Haley. Thank you, Haley.\n* am I * * am I losing my mind? *\nON THE BEACH\nJamie : Oh!\nQuinn : Jamie?\nJamie : Aunt Quinn!\nQuinn : Hey! Who let you off your leash?\nJamie : Uncle Skills, but he didn't bring the leash today.\nQuinn : Okay, where is he?\nJamie : He's over there. Miss Lauren, too. This is her hat. Cool.\nQuinn : Well, I was just on my way to go get a snack. Can I tempt you?\nJamie : Sure.\nQuinn : Yeah? You should probably tell them you're with me.\nJamie : Denzel, this is Macaulay. Denzel, this is Macaulay. I'm going for a snack with my aunt Quinn. Over. Okay, all set. Stupid, crazy nanny.\nQuinn : Hop on. Whoop! There we go. What do you want?\nON THE STREET\nDan : Hey, give me a sec, okay?\nRachel : Okay.\nDan : Mind if I join you?\nMan : Spare a few bucks?\nDan : First... you mind telling me how you got here?\nMan : You must be one of them religious guys or something.\nDan : No. I got nothing against religion. If you ask me, the one man you got to believe in... is you.\nMan : I stopped believing in me a long time ago.\nDan : Why? You made some mistakes? You failed sometimes? Listen. No matter what mistakes or failures you had, they weren't even close to mine. There's a book you should read.\nMan : You're talking about the bible.\nDan : No, man, it's not the bible. It's this book. Listen. There's a used-book shop around the corner. Now, you can take this book, sell it for a few bucks, buy yourself a bottle, and feel good for a few minutes. Or you could read it and feel better for the rest of your life.\nMan : Hey. What your name is, man?\nDan : My name is Dan Scott. And I believe in you.\nAT CLOTHES OVER BROS\nMillicent : He probably didn't mean it.\nBrooke : It was just the way he said it, as if the very idea of us ever getting married was somehow completely ridiculous to him. And then he hung this ugly army-man poster in the living room. I have to talk to him.\nMillicent : Okay, but he might freak out a little if you start talking marriage so soon.\nBrooke : No, about the poster, you dork. It has to go. I am really excited to meet Alex, though. How is she?\nMillicent : Um... she's really... something. She just wanted to freshen up. You're gonna love her.\nAT THE HOTEL ROOM\nMillicent : She's gonna hate you!\nAlex : Go away, you witch.\nMillicent : \"Witch\"? \"Witch\"?! Look, missy, my ass is on the line here!\nAlex : You mean your big ass.\nMillicent : Really? Really? Get up!\nAlex : I'm tired!\nMillicent : Well, you better get un-tired because you're going over to Clothes Over Bros, and you're gonna convince Brooke Davis that the half-million dollars she's paying you is not a waste!\nAlex : Half a million dollars?\nAT THE RESTAURANT\nClay : So, you want to talk? Talk.\nRenee : What, no \"hello\"? No introductions?\nClay : Your name's Renee. I recognize you from the picture you took when you trespassed at a 7-Year-Old's birthday party. You have a last name?\nRenee : You're kind of hot when you're all fired up.\nClay : I know he didn't do it. I don't know what your angle is, and I don't know why you targeted Nathan Scott, but what I do know is that he didn't do it.\nRenee : You're quite the party boy, aren't you?\nClay : I'm single. He's not.\nRenee : Oh, like that matters.\nClay : Maybe not to girls like you, but to Nathan it does.\nRenee : \"Girls like me.\" You know what's so great about justice? It doesn't discriminate against \"girls like me.\"\nNathan : What do you want from me?\nClay : Whoa, walk away, Nate.\nNathan : Huh?\nRenee : Hi, Nathan.\nNathan : You need to stop this.\nClay : Outside.\nNathan : You need to stop this now, okay? Do you hear me? Why are you doing this to me?\nClay : Come on.\nClay : What the hell is wrong with you?\nNathan : I just wanted to talk to her.\nClay : In public? In front of a roomful of people with camera phones and video, you wanted to talk with her, just thought you'd have a little chat?\nNathan : I'm sorry. I screwed up.\nClay : Yeah, you screwed up, Nate!\nNathan : What does she want?\nClay : I don't know. I was about to find out until Nathan Scott stormed in like a madman!\nNathan : Look, I said I was sorry, jackass. Let it go.\nClay : I'm gonna see if she'll sit down with me again. In the meantime, you just, um... Try not to get thrown through a window, all right? Damn it, Nate.\nAT CLOTHES OVER BROS\nMillicent : Brooke? Please don't fire me. Please don't fire me.\nAlex : Shut up. I'm an actress. I got this.\nBrooke : Alex, hi, I'm Brooke Davis. It's so nice to meet you.\nAlex : Oh... my... God. You are so beautiful.\nBrooke : Thank you.\nAlex : Can I just say that I'm so happy to be here? And I think it's so great that you make designer clothes for plus-sized girls. I never knew it was based on you, but I think that's so sweet.\nBrooke : Uh, no, I'm normal-sized.\nAlex : Oh, I know, but I have the best diet for you. You're so gonna lose that weight.\nBrooke : Okay. How was your flight? You flew private, right?\nAlex : Uh-Huh. They let me ride in the cockpit. It was so rad.\nBrooke : In the cockpit?\nAlex : Totally. They let me steer the plane and everything.\nBrooke : They let you fly the plane.\nAlex : I know! I'm so a cockpit girl.\nBrooke : That's what she said.\nAlex : Who?\nBrooke : Who what?\nAlex : You... you said she said something, but I don't know who you mean.\nBrooke : No, it's... it's an expression. When someone says something that sounds sexual, you say, \"that's what Alex : she said\".\nAlex : Oh. Right.\nBrooke : Okay.\nAlex : Why don't we show Alex the new line?\nBrooke : Great. You're gonna love it. It's kind of elegant and kind of edgy, and the pieces are a lot like this one.\nAlex : No, I don't like that.\nBrooke : Why?\nAlex : Uh, first of all, it's purple. When I was a little girl, there was this dinosaur thing, and it totally freaked me out, and it was purple.\nBrooke : You mean Barney?\nAlex : Yeah. That's what she said.\nBrooke : Okay. That's totally wrong, but...\nAlex : I know. I'm so funny, huh? My best friend, Kimmy, told me I should totally do more comedy. She says most people are really uptight, but I'm not tight at all.\nBrooke : That's what she said.\nAlex : Who? Oh, Kimmy? Yeah, she said that. She said I'm so much funnier than Cameron Diaz. I mean, plus, have you seen my ass? Come on. Way better than hers. Like way.\nBrooke : Could you excuse us for just... One minute?\nAlex : Sure. I have to pee, anyway.\nBrooke : Great. Second door on the left.\nAlex : Okay.\nMillicent : I'll just clean out my things and go.\nON THE BEACH\nJamie : Remember that time I stayed with you and uncle David for a whole week?\nQuinn : Yep, and we made pancakes every morning with chocolate sauce and whipped cream?\nJamie : Maybe if David comes, we could do that again.\nQuinn : Yeah. Maybe. Hey, are you sure Skills and Lauren won't be worried about you?\nJamie : Oh, man!\nIN THE CAR\nJamie : At least I got your hat.\nAT RED BEDROOM RECORDS\nHaley : So, can I talk to you?\nMiranda : Would you like to speak with me or talk to me?\nHaley : Oh, brother, you are a piece of work. So, you're excited about my record, right? John Knight's excited about my record, which is why you guys want to close Red Bedroom... to free me up to record?\nMiranda : In part, yes.\nHaley : If you close Red Bedroom, I'm not gonna make an album.\nMiranda : Haley, you need to remove the emotion from this. It's a business decision. It's not personal.\nHaley : It is personal. Everything about this label is personal... why Peyton started it, why she made me her partner... It's as personal as it gets.\nMiranda : If you don't record with us, you don't record at all. We have a contract with you. We own you.\nMia : But you don't own me.\nMiranda : It's a pleasure to meet you, Mia. I've seen you perform a few times, but we've never been formally introduced. Miranda Stone.\nMia : Haley's told me a lot about you.\nMiranda : Red Bedroom records will always be important to us, but at the moment...\nMia : Can we just cut to the chase?\nHaley : How is Chase?\nMia : He's good. He says hi. Thanks.\nHaley : Aww, I was there at your first date.\nMia : Oh, I know. You and Nathan were so great. I sold more records than any artist on our roster last year. But if this label goes away, so do I.\nMiranda : How so?\nMia : You distribute my records, but I record for Red Bedroom, exclusively. Peyton made sure of that.\nHaley : It's true. I checked.\nMiranda : Wow. Everyone has their price.\nMia : No, actually, not everyone. Peyton and Haley are responsible for my career, and you can't put a price on that. And even if you do, I won't accept it. So, congratulations. You're about to lose your biggest-selling artist. Does that pretty much do it, Hales?\nHaley : Yes. Thank you.\nMia : So good to see you.\nHaley : Oh, good to see you, too. You look so cute.\nMia : Thanks. I'll let you two talk.\nHaley : Yeah? Who's the bitch now, bitch?\nAT CLOTHES OVER BROS\nMillicent : I'm so sorry. I should have met with her first. I thought she was the girl from her movies.\nBrooke : It's okay. I thought so, too. She has been in that bathroom a really long time.\nMillicent : What are we gonna do?\nBrooke : I'll tell you what we're not gonna do. We are not gonna pay that dum-dum $500,000. We'll just have to... tell her something. We'll say the company went bankrupt or... Or maybe... we should just start speaking Spanish and she'll get really confused and she'll just leave.\nMillicent : I don't think that's gonna work.\nBrooke : It might. She is really dumb.\nAlex : Brooke?\nBrooke : Buenos dias. Tenido mucha cerveza.\nMillicent : Ay, mucha cerveza.\nAlex : It's okay. I, uh... I know I'm not what you expected. You don't have to pay me. It's just...\nBrooke : That's one of my designs.\nAlex : Since rehab, this dress is all I have. When I felt like I was nothing, it gave me strength and dignity. So, no matter what happens to me or where my life takes me, I'll wear this dress... your dress... and I'll be fine.\nBrooke : It's okay. Of course we will pay you. I... I think you look beautiful in that dress, and I think you're gonna be perfect as the face of the line.\nAlex : Really? That is so rad!\nBrooke : Oh!\nAlex : Yay!\nAT TV BROADCAST\nRachel : Hey. Look at this. It's all over the internet. The buzz is really positive.\nDan : I didn't really have \"buzz\" in mind.\nRachel : I know, but that's why you have me.\n*I'm here if you need me* *oh, this way* ...\nAT BROOKE'S HOUSE\nBrooke : Well, hi. What are you doing?\nJulian : Fixing you dinner, and thinking about getting rid of my poster.\nBrooke : Why?\nJulian : Because you have to eat and because... You hate it.\nBrooke : I don't hate it.\nJulian : Yeah.\nBrooke : No, I don't. I just... I don't really like it there.\nJulian : It's okay. My father, as you know, was always gone, always on some distant location or at the office, you know, making movies. But this one time, he came home and surprised me and took me to see \"the thin red line\". And then we spent the rest of the day together, just him and me. And that didn't happen very often. Actually, that really never happened again. But that day... that was a good day. That was probably the best day I ever had with him. And that was the day I decided I wanted to make movies, too, like my dad.\n*let it disappear into my hand* *whoa, yeah, my hand*\nAT THE RESTAURANT\nClay : I appreciate you meeting me.\nRenee : Oh, so now you appreciate me. What happened to confrontational Clay?\nClay : I'm confrontational because I'm protective over Nathan, and because, of all my clients, he's the last one I'd expect to be in this situation.\nRenee : And what situation is that?\nClay : You tell me.\nRenee : Ask me what's in the envelope.\nClay : I'm not here to play games.\nRenee : The night Nathan scored 35 points against Memphis, you threw a big party for him after the game. I should know. I was there. It got... pretty wild.\nClay : Get to the point.\nRenee : The pictures of what happened between me and Nathan that night are in the envelope.\nClay : Whatever's in that envelope is meaningless or fabricated, because we both know that whatever you're accusing him of doing, he didn't do.\nRenee : Maybe you should take a look.\nAT RED BEDROOM RECORDS\nMiranda : I spoke with John Knight. He thinks Mia's bluffing, and he still wants to fold the label. But I recommended we don't.\nHaley : Why?\nMiranda : Because integrity and loyalty still matter. Does that surprise you... that I actually have a heart?\nHaley : A little.\nMiranda : And besides, I don't think she's bluffing, and she makes us a lot of money. If I do this... if... Your album needs to be finished in the next six months.\nHaley : Hmm.\nMiranda : Why did Peyton start this label, anyway? You said it was personal.\nHaley : She thought that major labels were soulless.\nMiranda : We are. Don't forget it.\n*we just don't see it the same way* *but you're never sure* *we can't go on like this anymore*\nAT BROOKE'S HOUSE\nBrooke : It's open\nPaul : Brooke. You wanted to speak with me?\nBrooke : You know, my whole life, I wanted to get my mother to be proud of me. And then one night, Julian threatened to exile her from our lives, and I would do the same to you. I'm just not sure it would matter.\nPaul : You're upset.\nBrooke : I have this poster hanging in my living room, Paul. Of course I'm upset. And the only reason that it's hanging there is because you took him to see that movie, and for one day that boy felt close to his father. He felt loved and appreciated. And the sad part is that there was only one of those days. Because in my book, the day that he didn't feel that way should be the unique one. Fix it.\n*the hardest thing about this is I still care* *you know there's something better* *for both of us out there*\nAT SCOTT'S HOUSE\nHaley : Hey.\nQuinn : Hey.\n*cause you wait for rain*\nQuinn : How'd it go at the label?\nHaley : Um... I think I fixed it temporarily. Now I got to fix my sister. Did you talk to David?\nQuinn : There's not that much to talk about. We grew apart. You know, we stopped laughing as much, stopped caring as much.\nHaley : Did something happen recently?\nQuinn : One night in New York I went to go see \"Spring awakening\" with some friends. And after we took the subway to this ridiculous open-mike night in Brooklyn. And we watched these horrible performers who, for whatever reason, had to get onstage and be seen and heard. And as I'm watching them, I'm thinking that I understand them. You know, they... they were messy and... and unsure and maybe a little confused, but... but they were doing what they needed to do, you know, what their hearts needed them to do. And then David called my cell phone, and I didn't want to answer. You know, there was a time when he would have been sitting right there, and... and I would have loved that. But he hasn't been that guy in a while.\nHaley : You guys were great together, you know. I mean, you... you were really happy.\nQuinn : And then one day we weren't. And I know there's supposed to be some big, huge, important reason why, but there's not. It's just a feeling that I have that this isn't what I want for the rest of my life.\nHaley : People have a right to change, Quinn.\nQuinn : Yeah, but they also have a right to stay the same. They have a right to be exactly the person that they've always been. Okay? I didn't change, Haley. David changed. And now somehow I'm the one who's broken because of it. *wait for rain* *and I chase the stars* *we just don't see* ...\nHaley : So, tell me what the worst act was that you saw that open-mike night. Come on.\nQuinn : There was this really angry guy who sang \"Cat's in the cradle\". Yeah, I swear he was a serial killer.\nHaley : When he got done, everyone clapped, and he, like, sneered at the people who didn't. I guarantee you they're missing right now. *I chase the stars*\nQuinn : I miss you, Haley-Bob.\nHaley : I miss you, too. *bring on the wrecking ball*\nHaley : You're not broken.\nQuinn : Thanks. I hope not.\nAT BROOKE'S HOUSE\nPaul : Hi, son. I was just... heading back to L.A. and I wanted to... say goodbye.\nJulian : Okay.\nPaul : Listen... I came here to tell you that I think you're wrong to put your relationship before your career, but... I think it's me who's been wrong. I wasn't around enough. And... I was too busy caring for fictional characters instead of caring for the real ones in my life.\nJulian : You did fine, dad.\n*there's just too much, my, my*\nPaul : That poster... that was a good day for us?\nJulian : The best. *my heart's as cold as ice*\nPaul : I don't remember it. I'm sorry.\nJulian : It's okay.\nPaul : No, it's not. I'm proud of you, son. You go live your life and... Be happy. And whatever you do, don't be like me, okay? I'll see you. *the word that I breathe is a word that I need* *and the songs that I sing don't mean anything* *don't you wonder* *why it's always been this way?* *all our innocence is gone*\nAT THE BAR\nNathan : What'd she say?\nClay : That night after your big game against Memphis, we had that party. We got pretty wasted that night.\nNathan : Yeah. So?\nClay : Well, that was three months ago.\n*if you like, I'll take the blame* *for all the things that you have done*\nClay : She's three months pregnant, Nate. *my songs* *on a cold night* *I can't get you out* ...\nAT BROOKE'S HOUSE\nMan : And where will you run... back to the life of a peasant harlot?\nHarlot : Perhaps I will. But should I return to a life of more meager means, I will do so with my dignity intact...\nJulian : She's good in this. You were right.\nHarlot : ... my heart pure and true.\nBrooke : What? I love you. You know that? I love who you are. I don't know how you got there, but I'm glad you did.\nJulian : I'm glad I did, too, 'cause you're here with me.\nBrooke : Meager means, indeed. Mmm. Come here.\nMan : Harlot! Leave the dress!\nHarlot : This dress is all I have. When I felt like I was nothing, It gave me strength and dignity. So, no matter what happens to me Or where my life takes me, I'll wear this dress, and I'll be fine.\nIN THE STREET\nMan : I read your book.\nDan : Did it help?\nMan : It did when I sold it.\nAT SCOTT'S HOUSE\nNathan : How you doing?\nHaley : Better now. I had such a crummy day.\nNathan : Yeah?\nHaley : Uh-Huh.\nNathan : Well, I think it's about to get worse.\nHaley : Why?\nNathan : I have something I need to tell you.\n*my love* *is a young love* *but I know we'll get this right*\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

APARTMENT COMPLEX - HALLWAY - DAY]\n(The resident manager enters the darkened hallway of the apartment complex with two prospective renters, STEVE and NANCY.)\nStu Evans: You'll like this apartment. My wife says it's the best of the lot. Now, the tenants moved out kind of quick so I don't normally show apartments before I've had a chance to look, so ... use your imagination.\n(He unlocks the door to apartment #103 and pushes it open for STEVE and NANCY to look at. They both step inside ... aghast at what they see. There's blood on the walls and on the floor.)\nNancy: (to STEVE) Oh, my god. Call 911.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. APARTMENT #103 - DAY]\n(Camera close up of BRASS.)\nBrass: I worked in a slaughterhouse one summer. Looked a lot like this.\n(GRISSOM is also standing in the middle of the room. He's not looking at the walls, he's busy testing the blood.)\nBrass: (V.O.) The lease is in the name of Clifford Renteria. He lived here with his girlfriend till they snuck out in the middle of the night. Gee, I wonder why.\nGrissom: For all we know, this is animal blood.\nBrass: Yeah, sure. Deer, sheep, llama.\nGrissom: A deer hunter comes home from the mountains drunk decides to play butcher clean his kill. Chops his game up into oven-sized pieces for the winter. I mean, what does he care? He's renting.\n(GRISSOM drops a small sample of the mixture into the hand-held test and waits for the results. BRASS uses his flashlight and shines it on the test. Results of the test indicate that the victim was definitely \"human\".)\nBrass: Victim's human.\nGrissom: And a human has only eight pints of blood. So, whoever the victim is ... is now dead.\nHARD CUT TO END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. APARTMENT -- DAY]\n(GRISSOM is looking through a small instrument used to measure the blood spatter.)\n(QUICK CGI through the end of the instrument, up to GRISSOM'S eye, fade back down to the end of the magnifying lens to measure the blood spatter where 1 DIV = 1 MM. 20X. Flash to white. Resume on GRISSOM looking at the blood on the wall.)\nSara: (o.s.) Any uniformity in the spray?\nGrissom: Well, by and large, the average diameter is about one millimeter.\nSara: Blood drops this size are characteristic of high-velocity impact like gunshot trauma but there's no bullet strikes on the walls ... ruling out murder by gun.\nGrissom: Just acquaint yourself, Sara. Don't interpret just yet, okay?\n(SARA continues to look around the room. WARRICK is busy spraying luminol on the entire floor. When he's finished, he puts the spray canister down.)\nWarrick: All right. Show time.\n(GRISSOM closes the shades disturbing a single fly which buzzes off. SARA, WARRICK and GRISSOM wait while the luminol begins to glow.)\nSara: This looks like a multiple. More than one vic. Acquainting myself.\nWarrick: Check out these \"voids.\" That's the real evidence.\n(From the top view of the room, the entire floor glows except for certain \"voids\".)\nGrissom: Couch? We've only got 30 seconds till this luminol disappears.\n(SARA starts taking pictures of the \"voids\" and anything else pertinent. GRISSOM kneels to get a better look at the \"voids\" where he's standing.)\nGrissom: Television, maybe? A magazine?\nSara: Triangle ... coat rack?\nWarrick: Guys ...\n(Right where WARRICK is standing is an irregular shaped \"void\".)\nGrissom: What do you think that is?\nWarrick: Looks like it could be an electric saw.\nGrissom: High-velocity, small spray.\n(Close up on the \"void\" of the electric saw as it disappears ... )\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[EXT. MOJAVE DESERT NEAR LAKE MEAD -- DAY]\n(On the other side of the power lines, the hills are on fire. A helicopter flying by drops water on the flames. The camera travels low along the ground and moves upward as the helicopter with red bucket passes by.)\n(In the background we hear radio static and various radio dispatch transmissions.)\nRadio Dispatcher: 76 ROMEO, approaching ETS 4-NINER-SIX.\nPine Ridge Command: 76 ROMEO, you're right on it.\n76 ROMEO: Pine ridge command, go to white fire three.

Report to willow springs.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(NICK and CATHERINE carrying their CSI kits, pass by a group of fire fighters to get to the crime scene.)\nNick: Zero humidity, record highs. 'Tis the season.\n(They both meet up with DET. O'RILEY.)\nCatherine: Hi.\nDet. O'Riley: Hey. I don't even know where to start with this one. Take a look at that. A scuba diver ... up a tree.\n(True to form, there's a dead person in scuba gear stuck up in a tree. The CSIs, DET. O'RILEY and DAVID PHILLIPS all look up at the figure in astonishment.)\nNick: Wow.\nCatherine: How the hell he'd got up there?\n(CATHERINE is holding yellow evidence markers in her hand and is looking on the ground for anything unusual.)\nNick: He couldn't have climbed up there with all that crap on.\nDet. O'Riley: He got up there somehow.\nNick: Well, you know ... Lake Mead is just over the hill and the copters are dropping water.\n(CATHERINE looks up at the helicopter and bucket whirring by. She turns to NICK.)\nCatherine: You're serious?\n(NICK smiles.)\nCatherine: That's a total urban legend. We're scientists, Nickie. No way that happened.\nNick: (looking up) Okay.\n(Cut to CGI POV of a scuba diver in Lake Mead and a large red bucket being dropped into the lake. End of CGI POV. Resume on CATHERINE.)\nCatherine: And I suppose you believe in Santa?\nNick: After today ... oh, yeah.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APT #103 - DAY]\nBrass: When I said Cliff Renteria and his girlfriend skipped out in the middle of the night, I didn't have the whole story.\nStu Evans: I haven't seen Alison in over a month.\nBrass: Any idea where she might be?\nStu Evans: Renteria said she left town.\nBrass: So you noticed that she was gone?\nStu Evans: I manage the complex. I notice everything.\nGrissom: Did you notice if Mr. Renteria left a forwarding address?\nStu Evans: No. He just wrote the letter saying he was moving on. Listen, if you find him, you tell him he is not getting his deposit back, okay? The blood'll never come out.\nGrissom: Hopefully not. That's all the evidence we have.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[EXT. MOJAVE DESERT NEAR LAKE MEAD -- DAY]\n(CATHERINE searches the grounds for evidence. A helicopter whirs (o.s.) overhead. CATHERINE finds something and puts evidence marker #1 next to the scuba diver's pressure gauge. The needle is frozen stuck. She takes pictures of the pressure gauge.)\n(Cut to NICK as he crouches low to the ground. CATHERINE approaches.)\nNick: What do you make of that void? Green vegetation.\nCatherine: There's a consistent burn over this whole area.\nNick: Except for that one spot.\nCatherine: Well, the chief said that the original fire was a class \"C.\" Downed power line. Winds keep shifting hot spots breaking out all over.\n(NICK looks around and notices a burned cigarette butt and matchbook.)\nNick: Well, well ... downed power line, huh?\n(He motions to CATHERINE. She looks at it.)\nCatherine: Good eye.\n(CATHERINE puts down evidence marker #3 next to the matchbook and snaps a photograph of it. NICK picks the matchbook up.)\nNick: Matchbook time-delay device.\nCatherine: Don't touch it. It'll disintegrate.\nNick: That's the only reason I carry this stuff.\n(NICK pulls out an aerosol can.)\nCatherine: Hair spray. Extra hold?\n(CGI POV Close up of Hair spray adhering to the burnt matchbook sticks, coating them.)\nNick: The difference between walking and running. Guy lights a cigarette, sticks it in a matchbook takes a stroll.\n(CGI POV of a newly lit cigarette being wedged under the matchbook sticks. Flash to white. Close up of the matchbook and cigarette on the ground. Flash to white. Close up of fire consuming both the matchbook and the cigarette. Flash to white. Resume on NICK and CATHERINE.)\nCatherine: It buys an arsonist a five-minute head start.\nNick: Mm-hmm.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[EXT. MONACO RECEIVING -- DAY]\n(BRASS exits his car (Nevada license #IEP-353). He and GRISSOM approach CLIFFORD RENTERIA.)\nBrass: Monaco Receiving. Clifford Renteria, platform manager.\nGrissom: Gee, Brass, all in one shift. I'm impressed.\nBrass: Are you Clifford Renteria?\nClifford Renteria: Cliff. Who are you?\nBrass: Las Vegas police. With the crime lab. Do you have any knowledge of the whereabouts of Alison Scott?\nClifford Renteria: She's in Canada visiting her parents. Why?\nGrissom: We just came from your old apartment. We found some disturbing evidence there. Would you care to explain that?\nClifford Renteria: Hey, he had it coming. I'll tell you that right now. Apartment stank, there were flies everywhere, no water. So I trashed the place.\nBrass: Who had it coming?\nClifford Renteria: The apartment manager. The lazy b*st*rd. Serves him right.\nGrissom: Mr. Renteria, your apartment walls are covered in human blood. Are you aware of that?\nClifford Renteria: Yeah.\nGrissom: Do you have an explanation?\nClifford Renteria: It's my blood.\nGrissom: Your blood?\nBrass: You got a stigmata?\nClifford Renteria: No. I get nosebleeds.\nBrass: Nosebleeds?\nClifford Renteria: From Hepatitis C. I got blood to spare. My nose is like old faithful. Finally came in handy.\nGrissom: You expirated blood from your nose all over your apartment walls to get back at your manager?\nClifford Renteria: Yeah. I hope I made his clean-up job hell.\n(A noise from behind him distracts CLIFF RENTERIA. He turns around and sees a worker.)\nClifford Renteria: (to worker) That's not supposed to go anywhere.\nBrass: This guy blows ten quarts of blood from his nose onto his wall? You want to ask for a demonstration?\nGrissom: He's lying. Expirating from your nose would leave oval-shaped blood patterns. The ones we found in his apartment were V-shaped.\nBrass: Mr. Renteria. We're going to need a sample of your blood -- from your arm, not your nose -- and a visit to your new apartment.\n(CLIFFORD RENTERIA motions to the large truck #84438 behind them.)\nClifford Renteria: That's home to me now. Been staying there about a week.\nGrissom: Well, may we see your furniture?\nClifford Renteria: Sure.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. TRAILER]\n(From inside the truck, the back opens and we see all CLIFFORD RENTERIA'S worldly possessions crammed in the back of the trailer-truck.)\n(Camera cut to looking into the truck from the outside. We immediately see an electric saw in front of a large monitor-sized box with the label DM(TM) 604 S2.)\nGrissom: Electric saw.\nClifford Renteria: Used to do some landscaping.\nGrissom: Interesting lamp.\nGrissom: Mr. Renteria, with your permission, I'd like to move some of your property to my lab for a closer inspection.\nClifford Renteria: Hey, save me $250 a week truck rental. Keep it as long as you want. I'll sleep in the break room.\nBrass: That's after you come down and give us that blood sample.\n(The truck door closes to black.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. CSI - LAB]\n(Four people carrying various things walk by the glass lab wall. WARRICK walks into the lab carrying a large white box with the words \"PROPERTY OF FIREARMS\" written in black on the side. WARRICK is wearing a white jumper suit. SARA is also wearing the same type of white jumper suit.)\nWarrick: You check nosebleed's tools yet?\nSara: No observable blood. Not even with pheno.\nWarrick: That's because he probably ditched them after using them on the victim. Now we've just got to figure out which one.\n(WARRICK puts the box down. It's filled with various types of electric saws.)\nSara: How long did Firearms give us these for?\nWarrick: Twenty-four hours, then we've got to get them back. Clean.\nSara: Let's do it.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n(WARRICK zips up his white jumper, secures his gloves, turns the radio up.)\n(Cut to SARA zips up her white jumper. WARRICK puts on his head gear with goggles.)\n(Cut to SARA with her head goggles on mixes the paint they're going to use.)\n(Cut to WARRICK pouring the paint in a large plastic container that they'll be dipping the saws in.)\n(Cut to SARA dipping in a saw with a small round blade into red paint. Behind her, WARRICK is holding a different kind of saw.)\n(Cut to SARA holding the saw with paint against a clear pexi-glass board backing. She turns the saw on and lets the paint spatter onto the backing.)\n(Cut to Close up of a saw blade being dipped in paint.)\n(Cut to WARRICK holding the electric saw against a clear pexi-glass board backing. He turns the saw on and it spatters paint onto the backing.)\n(WARRICK and SARA repeat this test using the different saws in the box.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. CSI - GREG'S LAB]\n(Close up on GREG.)\nGrissom: (o.s.) So?\n(GREG looks up and sees GRISSOM standing there. He didn't hear him enter.)\nGreg: DNA results, um ... sixteen samples from the apartment walls and the one we just took from the guy's arm.\n(GREG puts aside what he's working on, finds the file and hands it to GRISSOM. GRISSOM opens the file to review the findings.)\nGrissom: This cannot be right.\nGreg: Hey, I always double-check your stuff. But all the results are pointing one way.\nGrissom: What about the blood on the lamp?\nGreg: That is my next run. Just a little backlogged.\nGrissom: Well, get through it.\n(GRISSOM leaves. GREG sighs.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- HALLWAY]\n(GRISSOM and BRASS walk through the hallway. GRISSOM is holding the file folder.)\nBrass: I thought you said the blood on those walls couldn't be his.\nGrissom: I also thought the metric system would catch on. Look, everything that starts with a faulty premise is bound to fail. I saw \"V\" patterns and I foolishly ruled out the nose.\nClifford Renteria: I told you I had a condition, Hepatitis C. I was diagnosed when I was 18.\nBrass: And this relates to your magic nose, how?\nGrissom: Hepatitis C destroys the liver and a whole host of clotting functions. Cliff, indeed, has blood to spare.\nClifford Renteria: Thanks for coming around to my side. Which way is out?\nBrass: Nobody released you.\nSHORT TIME CUT TO:\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- INTERROGATION ROOM]\nGrissom: Mr. Renteria, I can't sign off on a case until I fully understand it. So, let me get this straight. You had a beef with your landlord and you decided to pay him back by blowing blood out of your nose all over the apartment walls. Is that about right?\nCliff Renteria: Yeah.\nGrissom: A day? A week? A couple of months? How long did this take?\nCliff Renteria: I don't know. About a month.\nGrissom: So, you get up in the morning, make coffee and go \"I think I'll blow some blood on the kitchen wall today.\" Get out of the shower grab your towel, go \"Hey, this looks like a nice spot to expirate a couple of pints.\"\nCliff Renteria: It wasn't like that. Something would set me off. The disposal was backed up, no hot water, the toilet was broken ... I knew the landlord wasn't going to fix it.\nGrissom: So, you made your statement through your nose?\nClifford Renteria: I wasn't getting anywhere with words. Look, if it'll get me out of here any quicker, I'll show you.\n(BRASS and GRISSOM sit back in their seats. CLIFF RENTERIA stands up and looks around for the necessary materials. He picks up a sheet of newspaper and hangs it up on the blackboard behind him.)\nClifford Renteria: Um ... it's really not that big a deal.\n(GRISSOM stands up and moves closer to where CLIFF is. CLIFF turns around.)\nClifford Renteria: You might want to back up.\n(GRISSOM takes a small step backward and CLIFF takes a deep breath, holds a hand up to his nose and ... )\n(OFF BRASS as we hear a loud spraying sound. BRASS has his head turned away and eyes sideways toward the test.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. CSI -- LAB]\n(Camera on the newspaper with CLIFF RENTERIA'S latest artwork hanging clipped to a board. The camera moves to show us that next to the newspaper sample, is a photograph of a blood spatter from the apartment wall with ruler measurement. Next to that is a photograph of one of the electric saw glass spatters. Next to that is a photograph of a plastic trash can with spatters on that.)\nSara: (o.s.) Same high-velocity spray.\nWarrick: Same short \"v\" pattern, too.\nSara: Didn't you say expirating through the nose made oval patterns?\nGrissom: Yeah, well ... as it turns out our guy stands very close to the wall and blows almost sideways.\nWarrick: This is on the real. You actually saw him do this?\nGrissom: Right through his Jimmy Durante. Ambidextrous, both nostrils.\nSara: Great. Our big murderer's a nosebleed.\n(GREG enters holding a paper with test results. He hands it to GRISSOM.)\nGreg: Oh, not necessarily. Sample from the nosebleed's lamp. It's not his blood. And I don't know whose blood it is but the amelogenin came back with something pretty interesting: \"XX.\"\nWarrick: Female blood.\nGreg: Mm-hmm.\nSara: Our guy's girlfriend is still missing.\nGrissom: Two things which may have nothing to do with each other.\nSara: Or everything.\n(Camera holds on GRISSOM'S look.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY ROOM]\nCatherine: So you got an ID on the scuba guy?\nRobbins: Jacques Cousteau. Kidding. Coroner's humor. But I'll tell you what I do know. He didn't die in that fire. No carboxyhemoglobin in his blood.\nCatherine: Means he didn't inhale any carbon monoxide.\nRobbins: Tells us he stopped breathing before the fire started. Guy was probably killed someplace else and dumped.\nNick: Oh, he was dumped all right ... out of a chopper. Right, doctor?\nRobbins: Victim's injuries are inconsistent with a fall of that magnitude. No fracture of the pelvis no compression of the lumbar vertebrae no shortening of the body.\nCatherine: There goes your theory, Nick. Good try, though. So what was the cause of death?\nRobbins: His heart stopped beating.\nNick: Heart attack ... consistent with being scooped out of Lake Mead.\nRobbins: The human heart beats in a four-beat rhythm like a fox-trot. The two atria contract, then the two ventricles. Ba-boom, ba-boom.\nNick: So, what happened to this guy?\nRobbins: Commotio cordis. Cardiac concussion. The guy short-circuited. It's rare, but I've seen it. Couple of years ago a minor leaguer took a line drive to the chest.\n(CGI POV of a baseball hitting the center of a \"Blaster's\" jersey. Camera moves forward through the jersey and into the heart where it starts to beat irregularly. Flash to white. Resume to present.)\nRobbins: Interrupted the impulse to the heart turning it into a bag of worms. Fibrillation.\nCatherine: So, our scuba diver took one to the chest.\nRobbins: Definitely.\nNick: He could've been clipped by the chopper's Bambi Bucket. Did you find anything between his toes? Like sand from ...\nRobbins: ... Lake Mead. Sorry, Nick. But I did find something between him and his wetsuit. Soap residue. Like he started to shower. Soaped up never soaped off.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. CSI -- LAB]\n(Close up of NICK taking a swab of the soap residue from the dive suit. He looks at the tip of the swab. Close up of swab with the residue on it. NICK notices as GREG stands in the doorway.)\nNick: Something on your mind, Greg?\nGreg: No. I heard about your case. Sounds interesting.\nNick: Yeah. You want to make yourself useful, drop this off at trace.\n(NICK hands the container with swab within to GREG. GREG looks at the suit.)\nNick: Must be some kind of soap. Robbins got me halfway there.\nGreg: Bet it's liquid dishwashing soap.\n(GREG turns to leave and is nearly to the door with NICK stops him.)\nNick: Yeah? State your source.\nGreg: Well, you know I used to do a little diving myself actually. Belize, Maui, Great Barrier Reef ... Okay, maybe I took that one a little too far. But the point is, that these rubber suits aren't very easy to put on. Neoprene and skin need a little romance to get together. And a capful of liquid soap works like a charm.\nGreg: So, you check this safety valve?\nNick: Sealed closed.\nGreg: And what about the pressure gauge?\nNick: Hose melted. Catherine found it at the base of the tree.\nGreg: It's 3,000 psi; that tank was full.\nNick: Guess it's like anything pressurized. These things blow for one of two reasons: Too much air or too much heat.\n(NICK stops as it hits him. He looks at GREG. GREG looks back at NICK.)\nNick: You just made yourself useful, my friend.\nGreg: (smiles) Yeah?\nNick: Oh, yeah.\nGreg: How?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. APARTMENT -- HALLWAY]\n(GRISSOM and SARA return to the apartment complex. They're both carrying their CSI kits.)\nSara: What are we looking for exactly?\nGrissom: Same thing we're always looking for evidence of a crime. Failing that, we'll have to release this apartment.\nSara: What about Nosebleed's missing girlfriend? You heard Brass.\n[INT. APARTMENT #103]\nSara: He got a-hold of Alison Scott's parents in Canada. They said she never arrived. They had no idea she was even going to see them.\n(They enter the apartment and put their kits down.)\nSara: What if nose man blew blood all over these walls to cover up Alison Scott's blood?\n(GRISSOM considers the thought. He gets up and goes to the nearest wall. He scrapes the blood of a random sample.)\nGrissom: I don't see any evidence of that.\nSara: You're not finding another layer of blood under there?\nGrissom: No.\nSara: You don't think maybe he off'ed his girlfriend?\n(A fly buzzes by distracting GRISSOM. He looks up.)\nGrissom: How many flies do you count in this room?\n(They both focus their attention on the flies.)\nSara: Fifteen ... give or take.\nGrissom: I counted four on my first walk-through.\n(GRISSOM notices the mess on the fridge. SARA notices the mess high on the walls.)\nSara: Fly spots. Regurgitations.\n(GRISSOM pulls a chair out, stands on it and tests the fly spots. They come off on his finger.)\nGrissom: Fresh. Problem is flies don't feast on dry blood.\nSara: Place is sealed, and they don't spontaneously generate.\nGrissom: So they're feeding on fresh blood. Could be a rodent, though, or bad garbage.\nSara: Or it could be something higher up the food chain like Alison Scott.\n(Both SARA and GRISSOM start looking for a source.)\nGrissom: The preponderance of flies is in this room.\nSara: They can egress a space less than .001 centimeters.\n(Standing back to back, they search the room for the most flies. SARA looks up and finds it.)\nSara: Behind you. Vent.\n(Way up high near the ceiling, flies swam the vent grill. Camera holds on SARA and GRISSOM.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT.

Hair spray? Any of this sound familiar?\nGreg: Bags under the eyes, coffee cups, stress face. Any of this look familiar? I'm working on it.\nCatherine: Did Grissom put his stuff in front of mine?\nGreg: No. I'm working on your case -- with Nick.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT.

Working this case without me, huh?\nNick: Hmm?\nCatherine: Greg Sanders?\nNick: Let go my Greg-o. He's a CSI wannabe. Please. Check out the bottom of this tank.\n(NICK points to the tank.)\nCatherine: Fissure.\nNick: We had a little explosion here.\n(NICK reaches to uncap the dropper from a bottle of acid nearby.)\nCatherine: That explains a lot. Acid etching. Not bad.\nNick: Figure if I can get the serial number off the tank get on the horn with some surf shops track the renter through a credit card.\nCatherine: Pretty smart thinking there, partner.\nNick: Well, we still haven't ID'd the vic, but ... it's worth a shot.\nCatherine: Okay, N-4-double oh-2, let's see what kind of lead you are.\n(Off the sound of a doorbell dinging, we ... )\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. JERRY WALDEN'S APT HALLWAY]\n(The door opens and its CATHERINE and DET. O'RILEY.)\nJerry Walden: Hi. Uh, whatever you're selling, I have no interest, okay.\n(JERRY WALDEN tries to close the door. DET. O'RILEY puts out an arm to stop him.)\nDet. O'Riley: Maybe you should find out what we're selling first.\nCatherine: I'm Catherine Willows, Las Vegas Crime Lab. Detective O'Riley. Is there a Jerry Walden lives here?\nJerry Walden: You're looking at him.\n(CATHERINE looks at DET. O'RILEY.)\nJerry Walden: What?\nCatherine: Are you missing a scuba tank?\n(The door closes and JERRY WALDEN unchains the door. The door reopens.)\nJerry Walden: Come in.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. JERRY WALDEN'S APARTMENT]\nCatherine: So, let me get this straight, Mr. Walden. You lent Bruce Skeller a spare tank.\n(He sighs.)\nJerry Walden: Yeah. I just, I can't believe what you're telling me here. I mean, Bruce was an experienced diver.\nCatherine: Well, he didn't exactly dive in the water.\nJerry Walden: Bruce and I were about to break ground on this project. Really meant a lot to him.\nDet. O'Riley: You guys were in business together?\nJerry Walden: We've been best friends since we were kids. We used to build these forts together like our imaginary casino, you know? Now we were going to build the real thing. We partnered up with this big development company Adventures. I mean, we were ready to roll ...\nCatherine: Excuse me. You said that Mr. Skeller was an experienced diver. Why would he be borrowing a tank?\nJerry Walden: Well, just because somebody's experienced doesn't make them any less of a freeloader. He was just down on his luck. But, as I say, we were like brothers. I mean, we shared everything. What was mine was his, what was his was mine.\nDet. O'Riley: But you just said he didn't have anything.\nJerry Walden: Yeah, but he would've, you know. And I kept telling him that. I mean, that's what kept him going. And then this happened.\n(CATHERINE looks down on the hardwood floors and notices markings of something that's no longer there.)\nCatherine: There used to be something here.\nJerry Walden: Oh, yeah, it's my coffee table.\nCatherine: Interesting furniture. What is that, ash wood?\nJerry Walden: Yeah.\nCatherine: Is that what the coffee table was made out of?\nJerry Walden: Made them out of the same piece of wood.\nCatherine: Where is the coffee table?\nJerry Walden: Oh, I sent it out to get it refinished. The guy said it would be back in a week.\n(CATHERINE kneels to look at the markings and notices some splinters of wood on the floor.)\nCatherine: I, uh ... ... think it needed a little more than that.\n(She picks them up for a closer examination.)\n(JERRY WALDEN nods his head. Camera hold on CATHERINE looking back up at JERRY WALDEN.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. APARTMENT 103 - DAY]\n(There are more equipment in the apartment. Brighter lights. GRISSOM rests the vent grill on the chair. SARA kneels nearby. They both begin examining the vent cover.)\nSara: Fly egg casings.\n(STU EVANS appears in the doorway.)\nStu Evans: I thought I heard some banging around. You, uh, you find my tenant?\nSara: You can contact Captain Brass for that information, sir.\n(SARA holds out a business card. The forensics personnel standing there takes it and gives it to STU EVANS.)\n(GRISSOM picks up a live beetle caught in the grill's webbing.)\nSara: What do you got?\nGrissom: Either Paul or John.\nSara: A very important beetle.\nGrissom: The most important. The Silphid Beetle typically feeds on decomposing human flesh.\nSara: There's a dead body in here somewhere.\nGrissom: Mr. Evans ... could you get permission from the owner to let us break into these walls? Our original warrant didn't cover that.\nStu Evans: Depends, how many walls and what for?\nGrissom: We can't divulge that but it may be ... all the walls.\nStu Evans: In every room?\nGrissom: Yeah.\nStu Evans: You CSI's going to pay for the replastering?\nGrissom: We don't do that.\nSara: But you can submit a form to the city for reimbursement.\nStu Evans: Yeah, I'm still waiting for my tax rebate. I don't even have to bother the owner with this. He's not going to let you bust out these walls.\n(STU EVANS leaves.)\nSara: Now what?\n(GRISSOM holds out the container with the Silphid Beetle in it.)\nGrissom: DNA lab. I don't want to hear any rumors that Paul is dead. He may be the only chance we have of getting in these walls.\nHARD CUT TO BLACK.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT. CSI -- LAB]\nWarrick: We already know this beetle feeds only off of human blood, so why are we extracting its stomach contents?\n(WARRICK opens the container with the Silphid Bettle in it. He takes out the beetle and holds it down while SARA uses a small bore needle to get the sample out of the beetle.)\nSara: Ahhh ... Not so. According to Grissom -- Mr. Bug Guy -- the silphid beetle will actually feed on any decomposing mammal. So we need to show human DNA or we are not going to get a warrant to break down those walls.\nWarrick: Well, I hope he got his grub before you grabbed him up.\n(SARA stands up and looks around.)\nSara: Where's Greg? We need to get this processed. You know, I swear that guy has a second job somewhere else.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[EXT. MOJAVE DESERT NEAR LAKE MEAD -- DAY]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[EXT. UNDEVELOPED LAND NEAR LAKE MEAD -- DAY]\n(CATHERINE meets with PAUL NEWSOME, District Engineer, at the \"Future Site of Adventures Hotel and Casino\" as per the billboard in the background.)\nPaul Newsome: I'm, uh, all for being alone, but ...\nCatherine: Did you bring the file? Well, there goes the foreplay.\nPaul Newsome: It's in the car. I hope you appreciate that even as district engineer it wasn't easy getting you the original land deed.\nCatherine: Well, I know how you love a challenge. So, what'd the property sell for?\nPaul Newsome: Half a million bucks an acre. Is there anything else that you need to use me for?\nCatherine: Whoa. Excuse me?\nPaul Newsome: It's obvious that you're not here for me. You're here for yourself. So let's not waste each other's time, all right? The property was owned jointly by two men -- Jerry Walden and Bruce Skeller. At the time that they bought it, it was a steal -- fifty grand an acre. Two years later, Adventures Development come in, they start buying up the surrounding parcels. Your guys hold out, until last week and let me tell you, they got top dollar.\nCatherine: Hmm ... Capitalist's wet dream -- buy low, sell high. So they played it smart.\nPaul Newsome: Well, one of them did. From all I can tell Jerry Walden was selling to Adventures from the get-go but his partner ... well ... was a different deal altogether. He was a diehard environmentalist. A real tree-hugger.\nCatherine: You can say that again.\nPaul Newsome: He saw the writing on the wall. The urbanization of Lake Mead and he spent every cent he had trying to fight it. When it comes down to money versus the environment it's no big surprise who's going to win. So is there anything else that I can do for you?\n(CATHERINE kisses LEWIS, turns and walks away smiling.)\nCatherine: I'll see you.\n(Camera holds on PAUL NEWSOME.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT.

Well, there goes jet-skiing.\nCatherine: What about the land deed, Ronnie?\nRonnie Litre: Oh, what I can tell you about that is I'm impressed. If it is a forgery, it's a great forgery. Van Gogh. Nothing I can testify to.\nCatherine: What can you testify to?\nRonnie Litre: Have you seen my VSC-4 machine?\nCatherine: No.\n(RONNIE motions for CATHERINE to follow him. They move further into the lab.)\nRonnie Litre: The original copy of the land sale agreement, okay? Inks luminesce at different wavelengths.\n(Camera focuses on the original land deed document with the signatures of both sellers, JERRY WALDEN (dated 10/2/01) and BRUCE SKELLER and a third signature of the seller (also dated 10/2/01). The document is cast in a bluish light.)\nRonnie Litre: At one wavelength the signature on the left disappears.\n(The document is cast in a greenish light and JERRY WALDEN'S signature and date disappear.)\nRonnie Litre: At another wavelength the one on the right disappears.\n(The document is cast in a yellowish light and BRUCE SKELLER'S signature disappears. The document is cast in a red-colored light and both signatures disappear.)\nCatherine: Where'd it go?\n[CLOSED-CAPTION: RONNIE LITRE: I can bring it back.]\n(The document is cast in an orange-colored light and all signatures once again appear on the document.)\nCatherine: What does it mean?\nRonnie Litre: Whatever you make of it. You've got a legal document. Two signatures -- notarized, the whole nine yards. The only thing I can tell you is your two guys used separate pens.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[INT.

Jimmy Durante's girlfriend.\nSara: You're Alison Scott?\nAlison Scott: I see Cliff's been showing off again. It's one of the reasons I left him.\nGrissom: You left him?\nAlison Scott: I went back to my old boyfriend in Chicago.\nGrissom: Miss Scott, we found some blood on one of Cliff's lamps.\nAlison Scott: Stubbed my toe on that lamp ... like ... once a week. I begged Cliff not to buy that thing but he never listens.\nGrissom: Would you be amenable to providing us with a sample of your blood for comparison purposes?\nAlison Scott: Sure. But I'm telling you, that's my blood. Look, Cliff's ... well, he's a lot of things, but he's not a murderer.\nGrissom: Yeah, I still want a sample. Warrick, would you?\nWarrick: Uh ... yeah.\n(WARRICK, ALISON and BRASS leave the room. GRISSOM pulls his goggles off and sighs.)\nGrissom: You never get a second chance to make a first impression.\nSara: (counters) A square of nine dots on paper and you can only draw four lines to connect them ... without the pen ever leaving the paper.\n(GRISSOM smiles grimly.)\nGrissom: Right. Think outside the box.\n(SARA smiles at GRISSOM and starts looking around satisfied that GRISSOM is thinking about possibilities and not dwelling on the situation. The camera focuses on GRISSOM as he considers his options.

Um, I've got a full profile on our -- \"your\" torch. I pulled his DNA off of a cigarette butt. Lucky for us, he's a wet-lipped smoker.\n(CATHERINE looks down at the results and nods.)\nCatherine: So, you've done your job.

He steps aside while she works. Camera changes to microscope view of the two splinter pieces side by side.)\nCatherine: Radial chains align. Pores match. Two pieces of ash wood, one source.

He's holding a warrant.)\nBrass: You don't have to ask his permission. I got a new warrant that covers his apartment. (to STU EVANS) Your wife being missing put it over. Funny you didn't mention that before.\n(BRASS hands the warrant to STU EVANS who takes it and reads it. GRISSOM and SARA set up a small ladder that GRISSOM climbs to examine the vent.)\nGrissom: Did you know that your apartment shares heating ducts with the apartment next door?\nStu Evans: Yeah, me and Cliff were always fighting about the temperature. So what?\n(GRISSOM turns back to look through the vent. The camera moves backward through the vent to reveal among other things, more flies than one can count, dust and a congregation of Silphid beetles.)\nGrissom: Sara?\nSara: Yeah ...\n(GRISSOM gets down from the ladder and puts it away while SARA gets the hammer. Both she and GRISSOM start to rip the wall down.)\nSara: Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.\n(SARA reaches into the hole in the wall and removes a white blanket.)\nSara: Alklyd. There's blood on the blanket.\nGrissom: And Dermestidae Masculatus.\nSara: That's Latin for \"you're hiding a dead body\".\nBrass: What's the matter? Didn't realize how bad a corpse can smell so you just decided to move it around the place?\nGrissom: You can tell us where the body is or we can, uh ... tear your place apart piece by piece.

(Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.\nMonica: (entering from her room) Oww!\nChandler: What's the matter honey?\nMonica: I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?\nPhoebe: It starts?\nRachel: Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!\nMonica: Okay! (Runs off.)\nChandler: (incredulous) Already?!\nRachel: Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...\nChandler: Oh, I got some thoughts on that.\nRachel: Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...\nRoss: Take it from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.\nMonica: (returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3\" 3-ring binder on the table.)\nChandler: What in God's name is that?!\nRoss: Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!\nMonica: This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. (She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.\nPhoebe: That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it off now.\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: A Classroom, Ross is giving a lecture.]\nRoss: And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at... (Phoebe rushes in.)\nPhoebe: Hey! Ross!\nRoss: Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?\nPhoebe: I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.\nRoss: Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... (Motions that they should learn everyone's hometown.) (To Phoebe) Wh-what's going on?\nPhoebe: Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?\nRoss: Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?\nPhoebe: Nothing-Why?!\nRoss: Phoebe, you said it was urgent!\nPhoebe: Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.\nRoss: Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?\nPhoebe: (to the students) Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?\n[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Rachel and Monica are pretty much telling Chandler what the wedding plans are.]\nMonica: All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.\nRachel: Okay.\nMonica: All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.\nRachel: Aw.\nMonica: A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.\nChandler: Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't play anymore and Derrick... (Off of Rachel and Monica's looks) And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.\nJoey: (sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up one.) Y'know, something a little snugglyer?\nChandler: Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?\nJoey: Well, the duck...\nRachel: What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!\nJoey: Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!\nChandler: Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?\nMonica: Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!\nChandler: Okay.\nMonica: Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?\nChandler: Centerpieces!\nMonica: Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)\nChandler: Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.) But Lilies are the clear choice.\nMonica: Oh my God! It's like one mind.\nChandler: Uh-huh!\nJoey: (sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!\nRachel: Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!\nJoey: Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!\nRachel: What?!\nJoey: All right, I'm gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)\nRachel: Now Joey, what did the duck do?!\nJoey: I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!\n[Cut to Joey and Rachel's, Joey enters and heads for his bedroom. He pushes open the door to find the duck.]\nJoey: Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does not get sick and Joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream? (He's about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachel's room. He walks into her room and feels the bed.) That's so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.) Pillowcases! (He climbs in and groans in delight. Suddenly, he feels something under him and pulls out a little beat up paperback book. He opens it and starts to read from it.) (In his head.) Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar...(Stops reading and thinks.) The vicar? (Continues reading) ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his...(Out loud.) Whoa! (Reads on in silence.) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book! (Continues to read.)\n[Scene: Ross's apartment, Phoebe has moved in and has a massage client on the table she's set up in the living room. Ross enters and is shocked to see a naked man lying on the table.]\nRoss: Uh, Phoebe...\nPhoebe: Oh Ross, hi.\nRoss: Phoebe, what are you doing?\nPhoebe: I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.\nRoss: Phoebe!\nPhoebe: Okay, let's talk outside.\n(They go into the hall.)\nRoss: Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!\nPhoebe: What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!\nRoss: And they knew about it?\nPhoebe: (pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?\nRoss: Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!\nPhoebe: Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!\nRoss: The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is sweeping up as Rachel enters.]\nRachel: Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?\nJoey: Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?\nRachel: No.\nJoey: Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?\nRachel: Joey, did you eat my face cream?\n(She walks into her bedroom.)\nJoey: Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.\n(She comes back out.)\nRachel: Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?\nJoey: Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?\nRachel: (gasps) You found my book?!\nJoey: Yeah I did!\nRachel: Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!\nJoey: Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got p0rn!\nRachel: Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She goes into her room.)\nJoey: You got p0rn!\n[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross is coming out of the living room carrying his salad and a puzzle-beer! Cold beer. And he decides to fold up Phoebe's massage table, but being Ross has trouble with it as there is a knock on the door. He sets the table back up and opens the door to reveal a beautiful woman.]\nRoss: Hello.\nWoman: Hi, is uh Phoebe here?\nRoss: Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.\nWoman: Ohh great.\nRoss: Can I, can I help you with something?\nWoman: Well, I don't know. Are you a masseur?\nRoss: (deadpan) Yes I am.\nWoman: Great! (Calls down the hall) Dad! (Her old father walks in.) Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour. (She walks away.)\n(Ross isn't happy and closes the door slowly.)\n[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are having dinner with her parents.]\nMrs. Geller: So Chandler, your parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.\nChandler: Oh yeah, I should probably call them.\nMr. Geller: I remember when we first got engaged.\nChandler: Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.\nMonica: Oh dad, really you don't need to...\nMr. Geller: (ignoring her) Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know how that happened.\nMrs. Geller: (incredulous) You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!\nChandler: What a sweet story.\nMonica: Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.\nMr. Geller: What?! They wanted a scary story!\nMonica: Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. (She and Chandler laugh, but her parents don't.) What?\nMrs. Geller: You tell her Jack, I can't do it.\nMonica: What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?\nMr. Geller: We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: A Restaurant, scene continued from before the break.]\nMonica: I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!\nMrs. Geller: We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.\nMonica: You bought the beach house when I was 23!\nMr. Geller: Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.\nMrs. Geller: We really do feel bad about this though.\nMr. Geller: We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.\nMonica: What about when I started dating Chandler?\nMrs. Geller: Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!\nChandler: Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)\nMonica: I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!\nMrs. Geller: We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.\nMr. Geller: It seemed like such a simple idea.\nMrs. Geller: Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.\nMr. Geller: All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! (Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)\n[Scene: Ross's apartment, his massage client is on the table and Ross is reluctantly starting his massage. He spreads some lotion in his hands, and doesn't like it.]\nRoss: Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh, that's soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage him with those.)\n[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Chandler are returning from dinner, Rachel is already there.]\nMonica: I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?\nChandler: I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.\nRachel: Well what happened at dinner?\nMonica: My parents spent the money for our wedding!\nPhoebe: (gasps) My God! What did you order?!\nRachel: Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!\nChandler: Honey, it's gonna be okay.\nMonica: No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!\nRachel: No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)\nChandler: Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.\nRachel: Do you even understand what off the rack means?!\nPhoebe: Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?\nMonica: How? I don't have any money.\nChandler: Well, I have some.\nMonica: How much?\nChandler: Well, close to... (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)\nMonica: Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!\nRachel: Well what?! How-how much is it?!\nMonica: It's enough for wedding scenario eight.\nRachel: Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!\nMonica: (To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!\nRachel: (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.\nChandler: Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?\nRachel and Monica: Ah, yeah!\nChandler: Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.\nPhoebe: (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr. Chandler.\nMonica: This is the most special day of our lives.\nChandler: No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.\nMonica: Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.\nChandler: Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.\nMonica: You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?\nChandler: Yes, I am!\nPhoebe: Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Ross are there as Rachel enters and sees Joey sitting there.]\nJoey: Hey Rach.\nRachel: (quietly) Joey.\nJoey: Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?\nRachel: Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.\nJoey: No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.\nRachel: Well no, I don't smell anything.\nJoey: Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.\nRoss: (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?\nRachel: Nothing!\nRoss: (takes a drink) Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)\nRachel: Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!\nRoss: So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?\nRachel: Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. (Exits.)\nRoss: (chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) 'Sup?\nPhoebe: (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!\nRoss: (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I'm sorry?\nPhoebe: My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.\nRoss: (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!\nPhoebe: He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.\nRoss: Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him acu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.\nPhoebe: Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!\nRoss: Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.\nPhoebe: Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!\nRoss: He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.\nJoey: Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?\nRoss: His daughter was hot.\nJoey: Gotcha.\n[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the wedding book as Monica enters.]\nMonica: Hey.\nChandler: Hey.\nMonica: Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.\nChandler: Ehh.\nMonica: Eh, you work for that.\nChandler: Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.\nMonica: You do?!\nChandler: Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.\nMonica: Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?\nChandler: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.\nMonica: You thought about that?\nChandler: Yeah.\nMonica: How many kids were we gonna have?\nChandler: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.\nMonica: What else did you think about?\nChandler: Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.\nMonica: (laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.\nChandler: Sure you do.\nMonica: No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.\nChandler: You sure?\nMonica: Uh-hmm.\nChandler: I love you so much.\nMonica: I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.\nChandler: Oh yeah, totally!\nMonica: Oh good.\nEnding Credits\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is balancing her checkbook as Joey enters from his room wearing a hockey helmet, gloves, and shin guards.]\nJoey: Hello, Zelda.\nRachel: Who are you supposed to be?\nJoey: The vicar!\nRachel: Do you even know what a vicar is?\nJoey: Like a goalie, right?\nRachel: (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough alright?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!\nJoey: All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)\nRachel: All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!\nJoey: Huh?\nRachel: (starting to move closer to him) That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.\nJoey: (nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)\nRachel: (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!\nJoey: This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)\nRachel: Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; s*x me up!\nJoey: Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.\nRachel: Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off!

The man next to her (Albert) glances nervously at the window, then reaches across her to close the shade.]\nAlbert: Sorry. I'm a nervous flyer.\nLilith: Yes, I see. Oh, you're white as a sheet.\nAlbert: No, actually, I'm always this pale. My ex-wife used to say she could tell when I was embarrassed because I'd turn off-white.\nLilith: I can empathize. Sometimes after a late night, I covered my under-eye circles with Liquid Paper. So are you traveling to Seattle for business or pleasure?\nAlbert: Both, hopefully. I'm relocating for work. How about you?\nLilith: I need to ask an old friend for a favor.\nAlbert: It's a long trip just to ask for a favor.\nLilith: It's a big favor.\nAlbert: Well I hope your friend complies.\nLilith: It'll take some work, but I'll get what I want.\n[A flight attendant comes up.]\nAttendant: Oh, dear, you two look awfully pale. Can I bring you something?\nLilith: Not unless you have any extra melanin lying around.\n[She leaves as Albert laughs.]\nAlbert: You should be a comedian.\nLilith: I've thought about it.\n[She goes back to her reading.

The door opens and Frasier comes in.]\nFrasier: Dad? Dad, Dad! What? Are you hiding?\nMartin: I heard the key in the door, I thought Lilith might be with you. What's she coming for anyway?\nFrasier: Well, I don't really know. She said she was flying across the country to ask me about something that was important. She's being very mysterious about it.\n[He hangs up his coat as the doorbell rings.]\nMartin: Is that her?\nFrasier: Well, no. No, Dad, I'm not seeing her until tomorrow.\nMartin: Well, let me know when she's coming, will you, so I can come up with an excuse to clear out. Because I'm not good at winging it.\n[Frasier opens the door. It is Lilith.]\nFrasier: Oh, Lilith. Hi. Look who's here, Dad.\nLilith: Hello, Martin.\n[Martin smiles nervously, then glances at his watch.]\nMartin: Oh, time to go... practice my signature.\n[He heads for the bedrooms.]\nFrasier: Please, come on in, Lilith. So, I didn't think I was going to be seeing you 'til tomorrow.\nLilith: Yes, I know that was the plan, but I just had to stop by on my way to the hotel. What I'm here to talk to you about is not something one just drops on another person. [gesturing for him to sit] Please.\n[He sits down.]\nLilith: [sitting beside him] Frasier, recently a subconscious yearning has tunneled its way to the surface and I now know what it is I need in order to make my life complete.\nFrasier: Well, that's wonderful news. How can I help?\nLilith: You can give me your sperm.\nFrasier: I beg your pardon?\nLilith: I want to have another baby.\nFrasier: Well, you certainly don't need me for that. Surely... someone in Boston must have sperm.\nLilith: I came to you first so that Frederick could have a full sibling.\nFrasier: So, just like that we're going to have another baby together.\nLilith: No, not just like that. I mapped out our dominant and recessive traits on a genome square, applied Mendel's laws, allowed for anomalies and concluded that you are the best biological choice.\nFrasier: I see. Well, as enticed as I am by your honeyed words, I'm gonna need some kissin'.\nLilith: Frasier, don't misunderstand, I'm not proposing any change in our relationship.\nFrasier: Would we... sleep together?\nLilith: I thought we'd freeze your sperm.\nFrasier: Is that a \"yes\" or a \"no\"?\nLilith: Natural fertilization is impractical. I'd have to fly to Seattle every time I ovulate.\nFrasier: [getting up] Right, okay. So, then your plan is for me to visit some local doctor, freeze my essence and then bring it home with you.\nLilith: Correct. I'll take mine to go.\n[Frasier sits on the arm of Martin's chair.]\nFrasier: I don't know. I'm going to have to think about it.\nLilith: [rising] Yes, of course, absolutely. Think about it, and you can give me your answer tomorrow.\n[She heads for the door, Frasier follows.]\nFrasier: Okay.\nLilith: You can come back from around the corner now, Martin.\nMartin: [from around the corner] Good night, Lilith.\nLilith: Good night.\n[She leaves.]\nFrasier: You were eavesdropping?\n[Martin comes into the living room.]\nMartin: It was an accident and I only heard the part about her wanting to have another baby with you.\nFrasier: She completely threw me.\n[Martin settles into his chair.]\nMartin: Well, I don't know why you're so surprised. She's seen what the Crane genes can do and she's coming back to the well.\nFrasier: How does one respond to something like that?\nMartin: Well, I bet if you say \"No\" she'll go to Niles.\nFrasier: Really, it's just so self-centered. I mean, she's got this all figured out for herself without the slightest consideration for my life.\nMartin: And Niles'll say \"No\" for sure. Which means only one thing. [He gets a worried look.] She'll come to the source. Me. The fountainhead.\nFrasier: What?\nMartin: Can you imagine? Lilith's and my kid would be brother to you and Niles AND Freddie.\nFrasier: What are you talking about?\nMartin: And if you and Lilith got back together, you'd be his step-father and his brother and Niles would be your son and his own uncle. It's almost worth doing just so that I can tell the story.\n[Frasier just waves this off as he heads to his room. Fade out.]\nScene 3 - Cafe Nervosa\n[Fade in. Frasier is sitting at a table. Niles walks in.]\nFrasier: Oh, hi, Niles. Did Daphne and her mom get off okay?\nNiles: [sitting down] Yes. They picked up Roz and Alice an hour ago. Although, how they're going to get all the way to Canada without killing each other, I don't know.\nFrasier: Why did they have to go so far?\nNiles: Well, that was my idea. I read that Canadian Fun Country is one of the best amusement parks in southeastern British Columbia.\nFrasier: Well, I'm just saying Daphne's mom should be careful, you know. If you're here on a temporary visa, you know sometimes people have a hard time getting back into the country.\nNiles: [deadpan] That hadn't occurred to me, Frasier.\n[N.B. Niles no doubt recalls the family trip in [1.21.], \"Travels With Martin,\" in which the Cranes strayed over the border before Daphne's green card had come through, and they had to smuggle her back posing as an American.]\nFrasier: Well, seeing as how you're single, I'd invite you to join me for dinner, but I'm meeting with Lilith tonight on a matter of some delicacy.\nNiles: Dad told me. Now listen, don't feel obligated because she's buying you dinner.\nFrasier: Truth be told, Niles, I hadn't ruled it out entirely. It would be nice to have another child. And Lilith is a wonderful mother. It's just that, well, is it right to create a human being with a woman to whom you couldn't stand being married?\nNiles: Well, I'm behind you whatever decision you make, the right one or the crazy one.\nFrasier: Thank you.\n[Niles calls out to the passing Barista.]\nNiles: Excuse me, may I have an espresso?\n[The waiter nods and heads off. Frasier notices an envelope Niles brought in.]\nFrasier: What have you got here?\nNiles: Oh, some snapshots from last summer at the beach. Daphne finally got them developed.\n[He shows them to Frasier who starts chuckling.]\nFrasier: Oh, there's Dad eating that hot dog he dropped in the sand. And you, in your linen beach ensemble.\nNiles: Very nice, yes. Well that's strange. Daphne said I'd particularly like the last picture on the roll but what is it?\nFrasier: It's hard to tell, it's too dark and blurry.\nNiles: Looks like the eye of Jupiter.\nFrasier: Or a slice of pepperoni\nNiles: Is it a flying saucer?\nFrasier: Yes, Niles, it's a flying saucer. Mystery solved, well done.\n[The Barista brings Niles's coffee over and sees the photo.]\nBarista: Hey, where'd you get the nipple shot?\nFrasier: Good lord!\n[Frasier and Niles look again in shock, then Niles clutches the photo to his chest.]\nNiles: You are to erase that from your mind.\nFrasier: Is it Daphne?\nBarista: Nice.\nNiles: You're not erasing! Erase!\n[The Barista heads off as Niles points a warning finger at Frasier. Fade out.]\nScene 4 - Daphne's Car\n[Fade in. Daphne is driving, with Roz next to her and Alice and Gertrude in the back.]\nRoz: I need to stop again.\nDaphne: We just stopped. I told you not to get that Big Gulp.\nRoz: But it was only ten cents more.\nAlice: Punch buggy blue!\n[She hits Gertrude on the arm.]\nGertrude: Ow! Dammit!\nDaphne: Language!\nGertrude: Why does she keep doing that?\nRoz: It's a game.\nGertrude: It hurts.\nDaphne: All right, mum.\nRoz: There's a gas station right there, I really need to stop.\nDaphne: I can't get over, you'll have to wait.\nRoz: But according to this, my bladder is holding \"Thirsty-Two\" ounces of soda.\nDaphne: It's only forty miles.\nAlice: Punch buggy red.\n[She hits Gertrude on the arm.]\nGertrude: Oh! Son of a...!\nDaphne: Language!\nRoz: Alice, honey. Stop hitting Mrs. Moon. She can't take the punch buggy game.\nGertrude: Oh, really? Punch buggy white!\n[She knuckles Roz on the shoulder.]\nRoz: Ow! It was a Jeep!\nGertrude: I play the Jeeps. And Ford. Punch buggy Ford.\n[She whacks Roz on the head.]\nRoz: Ow!\n[Roz turns around to get her back.]\nDaphne: All right, that's enough. You stop it or no one's going to Canadian Fun Country. And this time I mean it!\n[They go for a minute in silence, then Gertrude screams and points, startling screams from everyone else.]\nGertrude: I'm sorry. I thought you were on the wrong side of the road. I will never get used to the crazy way you drive over here.\nDaphne: Mum, you have to stop doing that.\nRoz: Daphne, you seem stressed. Do you want me to drive for a while?\nDaphne: Maybe once we get out of Seattle.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene 5 - A Restaurant\n[Fade in. Frasier and Lilith are sitting at a table looking over menus.]\nLilith: Frasier, I don't want to rush you, but the suspense is too much to bear. Have you decided?\nFrasier: I'm thinking about the linguini.\nLilith: I see. It's \"No,\" then, isn't it?\nFrasier: I'm sorry, Lilith. This was a very difficult decision for me and I am touched and flattered that you came to me, but I'm not sure I'd be doing it for the right reason. You understand, don't you?\nLilith: Yes, I do. And I appreciate your taking the time to think about it. It's that kind of consideration I was hoping to pass on to our second born. Oh, well. So, the pasta is good here?\nFrasier: Oh, the best.\n[She glances at the menu some more, then begins to quietly sing to the tune of the \"Ode to Joy\" chorus of Beethoven's 9th.]\nLilith: My dad is the gweatest dad because he cooks me Cweam of Wheat...\nFrasier: [glaring at her] Lilith, what are you singing?\nLilith: Was I singing?\nFrasier: You were singing \"My Dad Is the Gweatest Dad.\"\nLilith: Oh, you mean that song Frederick wrote for you when he was four.\nFrasier: That video is one of my prized possessions. Of course I haven't looked at it in some time.\nLilith: I remember the night we surprised you with it. He crawled up in your lap and said \"Why is Daddy cwying?\"\nFrasier: I see what you're doing, you know.\nLilith: What?\nFrasier: You are attempting to manipulate me by invoking powerful emotional memories.\nLilith: I assure you, nothing could be further from the truth.\n[A waiter comes up.]\nWaiter: Are you ready to order?\nLilith: Yes. I'll have the basgetti and beatmalls.\nWaiter: Mmm. Very good Miss.\nLilith: That's what our son used to say when he was three.\nWaiter: Excellent.\nFrasier: And I'll have the veal.\nWaiter: Bravo, sir.\n[He takes the menus and heads away.]\nFrasier: Lilith, I'm afraid you're idealizing parenthood. Do you remember colic, teething, changing mountains of diapers?\nLilith: Do you remember that time in the bath when he tried to eat the bubbles? We told him to stop, but we kept laughing so he thought it was funny and kept doing it.\nFrasier: You know, I'd forgotten that. Oh, I wish we had that on video.\n[She grabs his hand.]\nLilith: You can, Frasier. We can have those days back again. Please, I just need is a couple of teaspoons.\nFrasier: Lilith!\nLilith: Just think about what Frederick has meant in our lives.\nFrasier: I think about it every day.\nLilith: Frasier, we're always seeking ways we can leave a legacy. Well, forget my research and your work, this is it! What better gift can we bestow on the world but another person as wonderful as Frederick?\n[Frasier signals the waiter passing by.]\nFrasier: Excuse me, I've changed my mind. I've decided that I too will have the basgetti and beatmalls.\n[Lilith looks up at him, grateful. Fade out.]\nEnd of Act 1\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nAct 2 Scene 1 - Cafe Nervosa\n[Fade in. Niles is sitting at a table, Frasier is getting juice at the counter.]\nFrasier: Thank you.\n[He comes over to join Niles]\nFrasier: Gosh, that coffee smells so good. Lilith won't let me have any caffeine until I've made my little donation.\n[He sits down.]\nNiles: Of course.\nFrasier: So, have you heard from Daphne?\nNiles: No, we keep missing each other. I'm just glad I have our little... pictorial memento to keep me company.\nFrasier: I can't believe you're so taken with that blurry, over-exposed photo of a...\nNiles: Shh!!\nFrasier: Of what you first mistook to be a flying saucer!\nNiles: I just think it's sexy that she even did it. Just imagine\nit: she saw that there was one picture left on the roll, and in a spontaneous moment of brazen exhibitionism, she threw open her blouse and didn't even bother to adjust the f-stop. Yes indeed, I am married to one spicy meatball.\n[He opens his jacket and checks the picture.]\nFrasier: Good lord! Don't tell me you carry it around with you.\nNiles: Well, I didn't want the housekeeper to find it and think we were pornographers.\n[Frasier just takes this in stride. Fade out.]\nSOME MAGAZINES, A SPECIMEN CUP,\nAND A RECORDING OF\n\"TRISTAN UND ISOLDE\"\nScene 2 - The Fertility Clinic\n[Fade in. Frasier and Lilith are checking in.]\nNurse: Just fill out these forms and I can show you to one of our donation suites.\n[Fraser takes a clipboard and he and Lilith sit. As he fills out the form, the man across from him glances up.]\nMan: Will this be your first?\nFrasier: No, I've been doing this since I was twelve.\n[Lilith kicks him gently.]\nFrasier: You mean baby. No, no, this is our second.\nMan: We've got number four on the way.\nLilith: And we're thrilled for you, but perhaps we could chat some other time when we're not trying to create life. [to Frasier] Sign and date.\nFrasier: Right.\n[He finishes up the form and Lilith takes it back to the window.]\nMan: This process can be hard on a relationship, but she'll relax and things'll get better.\nFrasier: We're already divorced.\nMan: Good, 'cause she'll never change.\n[The man's wife slaps him on the shoulder at this. Lilith comes back.]\nLilith: Up and at 'em.\n[He gets up.]\nNurse: Follow me, sir.\n[She leads him to a room.]\nNurse: Just go in and make yourself comfortable. You'll find everything you need in the cabinet.\nFrasier: Thank you.\n[He starts in, but Lilith stops him.]\nLilith: Oh, wait Frasier. It probably doesn't matter, but try to think positive thoughts.\nFrasier: Thanks for that. I was going to think about the plight of the American Indian.\nLilith: I'm just saying we should put the welfare of the sample first.\n[He goes into the room and closes the door. Lilith turns away, then turns back and taps on the door.]\nFrasier: [from inside] Yes?\nLilith: And don't fall asleep afterwards, I want to get these puppies on ice ASAP.\nFrasier: Goodbye now.\n[She starts away, but turns back again, tapping on the door.]\nLilith: Just a hint...\nFrasier: Lilith! If there is ONE thing I can do BY MYSELF, this is it! Now go away.\n[She heads back to the seats.]\nNurse: Right this way.\n[She leads the other couple off as Lilith sits down and dials her cell phone. A cell phone rings in Frasier's donation suite. He yanks the door open, furious.]\nFrasier: What?!\nLilith: I just remembered a special method which supposedly increases the likelihood of having a boy.\nFrasier: I see. Is there something I can do to increase the likelihood that we won't have a meddling control freak?\nLilith: No, but perhaps you can use a method that will give us a baby that can take other people's advice.\nFrasier: I would settle for a method where it won't turn out to be a sarcastic prig!\nLilith: Oh, just do it!\nFrasier: Fine!\nLilith: Wait, I don't want you to do it when you're mad. Why don't we just take a minute to sit down and breathe?\nFrasier: It's your dime.\n[He comes out and sits down beside her.]\nFrasier: Oh, dear God. What if this child inherits all of our flaws instead of our strengths? We could create a real nightmare.\nLilith: That's not going to happen. It's going to be exactly the way it was the first time.\nFrasier: Is that what's going on here? Are we trying to create a baby or just trying to recreate the past? I mean, Frederick's almost grown now, it's only natural to feel a sense of loss.\nLilith: Frasier, don't be simplistic.\nFrasier: No, Lilith, I know what you're going through. You want to feel needed and loved as you were when you were a new mother. The past can be very seductive. I mean, I've fallen into it\ntoo: I'm trying to relive Freddie's childhood. You can't use the past to fill what's missing in the present. It's gone.\nLilith: Frasier, I've done a lot of thinking and this feels right to me.\nFrasier: But it's not right for me. I'm sorry.\nLilith: I'm sorry too.\n[They get up and hug.]\nFrasier: You all right?\nLilith: I'm fine. If I can't make anther little Frederick with you, there's always cloning.\n[Frasier's jaw drops.]\nLilith: And you still don't know when I'm joking.\nFrasier: I, well, I...\n[He grabs his coat.]\nFrasier: Lilith, what are you going to do now?\nLilith: Well, I'm going to go home and give Frederick a very big hug.\n[She opens the door.]\nLilith: And maybe swab the inside of his cheek.\nFrasier: Oh, stop that!\n[They head out. Fade out.]\nScene 3 - Frasier's Apartment\n[Fade in. Martin is in his chair, eating a snack. Niles comes in the front.]\nNiles: Oh, you already ate. I was gonna take you to Bogart's.\nMartin: Bogart's? [putting the dish down] Oh, don't worry about that, I was just eatin' it because it was here. I wasn't eatin' it to get full. Just give me two minutes.\n[He gets up and heads for his room. As Niles sits on the couch his cell phone rings and he answers.]\nNiles: Hello?\nDaphne: [voice over] Oh, Niles, darling.\nNiles: Daphne!\n[Cut to - Daphne and the others in her car.]\nDaphne: I thought I'd never reach you. We were booted from the park and are coming home. It seems someone put out a cigarette on a stuffed moose.\nGertrude: I didn't know it was stuffed, I was defending myself.\nNiles: [v.o.] I loved those pictures you left for me.\n[Cut to - Niles on the couch.]\nNiles: More specifically, the last one.\n[He pulls it out of his pocket.]\nDaphne: [v.o.] Something a little different, eh?\nNiles: Indeed it is. I can't even believe you took it.\n[Cut to - Daphne.]\nDaphne: I didn't take it, your father did.\n[Cut to - Niles.]\nNiles: No, I don't think so. I'm talking about the last picture on the roll, the close-up.\n[Cut to - Daphne.]\nDaphne: Yeah. You're father was trying to get a picture of Eddy, but instead he got a picture of his own chest.\n[Cut to - Niles looking troubled.]\nNiles: This is Dad's...?\n[Cut to - Daphne.]\nDaphne: That's his nipple.\n[Cut to - Niles looking horrified. Martin comes in as Niles slowly rises.]\nMartin: Oh, I can't wait to get to Bogart's. I know just what I'm\ngoing to get: the barbecue chicken breast. They have the juiciest one in town. Or, or the lamb. They serve an enormous rack.\nNiles: [flustered] Great.\nMartin: You might want to get an overcoat of Frasier's out of there. It's supposed to be pretty nippy tonight.\n[Niles, troubled, grabs the coat. Frasier comes in.]\nFrasier: Oh, hi Dad. Where are you going?\nMartin: Oh, Niles is here. We're just going out for a bite. You want to join us?\nFrasier: Sure.\nMartin: So, how's Lilith?\nFrasier: I just dropped her off at the airport. She's disappointed, but she knows that we're doing the right thing.\nMartin: Well, for what it's worth, I think you are too, son.\nFrasier: Thanks, Dad. I just hope she finds what's missing in her life.\n[Dissolve to - Lilith on the airplane, looking out the window. Someone approaches.]\nAlbert: Hey, pasty.\n[She looks up and sees the man who was sitting next to her when she flew in to Seattle.]\nLilith: Oh, hello.\nAlbert: May I?\nLilith: Yes, certainly.\n[He sits down.]\nLilith: What happened? I thought you were relocating to Seattle.\nAlbert: Oh, it wasn't a fit. I'm going back to Boston. I don't know, call me neurotic, I just can't work in a lab that's not immaculate.\nLilith: You work in a lab?\nAlbert: Mm-hmm. I'm a physicist.\nLilith: Really?\n[She looks at him speculatively.]\nLilith: My name's Lilith.\n[They shake hands.]\nAlbert: Ah, the demon-goddess. Are you like the independent fireball that was your predecessor?\nLilith: I make her look like a vacillating cream puff.\nAlbert: Albert.\n[They shake hands again.]\nAlbert: What happened with your friend? Did you get your favor?\nLilith: It's a long story.\nAlbert: Well, it's, it's a long flight.\n[She smiles at him and settles in to talk. Fade out.]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nNiles is at Frasier's apartment, glancing around furtively. He pulls the photo out of his pocket and reels from the image of what he's been fantasizing over, falling into Martin's chair, then reeling away from it. He does an antsy little dance, then tears the photo up. He walks into the kitchen and throws it away. Martin is busy at the counter and turns around, holding up two plates with white scoops of ice cream with cherries on top. He offers one to Niles who just turns and marches away. Martin shrugs reflectively and turns back with a \"more for me\" smile on his face.\n\nQuestion: What is a summary of the preceding text?\nAnswer:until",

Keep it hidden under your mattress.\nKATE: Leave now.\nTONY: Ah, you're a Spike Steel fan, aren't you, Probie?\nMCGEE: What, the p0rn star?\nTONY: No, the physicist.\nMCGEE: Oh, no not really. He looks kind of sleazy.\nKATE: Actually he looks a little bit like Tony.\nTONY: Oh, you have no idea how much he looks like me.

Sergeant lost his traction and slipped.\nGIBBS: Are you a trained investigator, Ranger Kett?\nKETT: Been working this park five years, Agent Gibbs. It's as treacherous as it comes up here. Seen a lot of hikers go over.\nGIBBS: This hiker was a Marine.\nKETT: Yeah, well, this Marine slipped and fell to his death.\nGIBBS: You said he was filming.\nKETT: That's what his wife said.

What kind of wounds are these, Doctor?\nDUCKY: They're Coyote. They would eat the exposed tissue first.\nJIMMY: What's second?\nDUCKY: If what I suspect is true, the abdominal cavity has been chewed open. The liver and kidney are a rich source of nutrients for these creatures.\nJIMMY: That's gross, Doctor.\nDUCKY: Well actually, Mister Palmer, we're quite lucky here. In some cases they chew off the head and carry it away so they won't have to fight other coyotes for it. My coroner friend in Los Angeles says coyotes take it \"to go.\" They're very strange in Los Angeles.\nGIBBS: Anything unusual, Duck?\nDUCKY: Not really, Jethro.

He was nothing to worry about. He was in a trailer over there. Scruffy guy. He was drinking too much. He got loud. We asked him to keep it down.\nGIBBS: He didn't keep it down?\nCAINE: No, Sir. So we went over there and tried to reason with him. That's when he took a swing.\nKATE: You took a swing back?\nCAINE: No, Ma'am. Bill put him in a head-lock 'til he calmed down and then he just took off.\nGIBBS: I don't suppose you got a license number?\nCAINE: No, point, Sir.

Not to mention the Sunday dinner treat sushi through a straw. Give me a pair of tweezers, Mister Palmer. There's something peculiar here.\nJIMMY: What is it, Doctor?\nDUCKY: I haven't a clue. That's why you will take it directly up to Abby. I was thinking, Mister Palmer...\nJIMMY: Yes, Doctor?\nDUCKY: Perhaps it about time you came over to the house one evening.\nJIMMY: Came over?\nDUCKY: Join us for dinner.\nJIMMY: Ah... that'd... that would be great.\n(SFX: DOORS SLIDE OPEN)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT.

We are just discussing potential suspects.\nTONY: Focusing on the Sergeant's wife and best friend, Boss.\nGIBBS: Yeah. Well, come on. We've got one more.\n(TONY AND MCGEE GIGGLE)\nKATE: You guys are four years old, honestly.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. LAB - DAY\nTONY: Uh... nice hat.\nKATE: Attractive.\nMCGEE: In a weird way.\nGIBBS: Why?\nABBY: Well, I had to set up a clean room in the ballistics lab to work on the damaged videotape. And just throwing the hats away seemed sort of wasteful. So I decided to recycle. What do you think?\nGIBBS: I think it suits you. Now what's on the tape?\nABBY: Oh, I haven't finished cleaning it up yet, but I have a P-O-I.\nTONY: Person of interest.\nGIBBS: Let's see it.\nABBY: The following program has been edited for time and content. It may not be appropriate for younger viewers.\nGIBBS: Abby!\nABBY: Right.\nJUDY: (ON TAPE) This isn't a good idea, Bill.\nMOORE: (ON TAPE) I've asked this guy three times to turn his music down.\nCAINE: (ON TAPE) Yea, now we make him.\nMOORE: (ON TAPE) And if he has a gun or something in there?\nCAINE: (ON TAPE) I film it and we get the redneck arrested.\nMOORE: (ON TAPE) Way to encourage him, Roger.\nCAINE: (ON TAPE) Oh, come on, honey. It's not that big of a deal. We'll be right back.\nABBY: Okay, this next part is like an outtake from Deliverance.\nRUNION: (ON TAPE) I thought I told you guys to leave me the hell alone!\nMOORE: (ON TAPE) Sir. We will once you turn the music down.(SFX: DOG BARKS B.G.)\nRUNION: (ON TAPE) What? Do you think I'm afraid of you or something?\nMOORE: (ON TAPE) I'm not here to fight you. We just want you to lower the music...\n(SFX: STRUGGLE)\nMOORE: (ON TAPE) Hey hey hey!\nRUNION: (ON TAPE) I'll kill you! I'll kill you!\nMOORE: (ON TAPE) No. What you just did, you just assaulted me on camera. Now either you leave or we're going to call the cops.\nRUNION: (ON TAPE) All right. Just let me go.\nMOORE: (ON TAPE) Huh?\nRUNION: (ON TAPE) All right.\nGIBBS: We need to I.D. this guy.\nABBY: Oh, I'm way ahead of you, Gibbs. I got a shot of the license plate. It is registered to a David Runion. His last address is an R.V. campground in Manassas. He's since moved.\nGIBBS: Find him. That's good work, Abby. Tony, head back to Shenandoah State Park. Take McGee.\nTONY: For what exactly, Boss?\nGIBBS: I want to know where the Sergeant was killed before he was tossed off that cliff.\nTONY: Oh. Get the sedan ready, Probie. I'll meet you out front.\nABBY: So Kate, you really like my hat?\nKATE: Uh... it's different.\nABBY: Cool, because I made you one!\nKATE: Abby, I don't know what to say.\nABBY: Put it on!\nKATE: Okay.\nMCGEE: She bet me twenty bucks that she could make you wear that today.(MCGEE WALKS O.S.)\nABBY: Your cut.\nKATE: Pleasure doing business with you, Abs.\nABBY: Totally.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. STATE PARK - DAY\nTONY: Hurry it up, McGee.\nMCGEE: I mean, you could have helped.\nTONY: I did. I carried the camera. Moore was a Marine, a combat veteran. Probably not the easiest guy in the world to sneak up on.\nMCGEE: Unless he knew his attacker.\nTONY: Or was ambushed. It's pretty wide open space. Let's check out the tree line.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. TRAIL - DAY\nMCGEE: Blood drop.\nTONY: Sure looks like it. Okay, we're going to have to search in there. You're going to want to watch out for--\nMCGEE: Yes, I know how to search a wooded area, Tony. I'm not an idiot.\nTONY: I didn't say you were.\nMCGEE: Then why do you always treat me like one?\nTONY: Just trying to impart a little wisdom, McGee.\nMCGEE: Look, I graduated top of my class at FLET-C. So I think I can handle it.\nTONY: Be my guest. Give me a call if you find anything.\nMCGEE: I will.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY\nKATE: I found David Runion, Gibbs. He checked into another campground twenty miles from the Shenandoah State Park. Also ran a background check on him. He's served time.\nGIBBS: For what?\nKATE: Assault and battery. He nearly beat a man to death with a pool cue in ninety three.\nGIBBS: Looks like this time he might have succeeded.\nKATE: We getting a warrant?\nGIBBS: We need evidence for a warrant, Kate. Right now I just want to talk to him.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. WOODED AREA - DAY\nMCGEE: Tony! I found it!\n(PASSAGE OF TIME)\nTONY: Not bad. Not bad at all, McGee.\nMCGEE: Thanks. Hey, I'm sorry about that there.\nTONY: Don't mention it. Besides, that's a pretty brave thing to do.\nMCGEE: What do you mean brave?\nTONY: Well, crawling around back here in all this poison ivy. I don't know if I would have done it.\nMCGEE: You're... you're kidding, right?\nTONY: Leaves of three let them be, McGee. A little something I picked up during my first year. Don't touch me, by the way.\nMUSICAL BRIDGE TO:\nEXT. CAMPGROUND - DAY\nKATE: Is that a rat or a dog? Hey, buddy. Hey. Oh. Sorry. I wouldn't do that if I were you, Gibbs.

It won't be the first time I had to do this.\nKATE: Maybe we should.\nTONY: He's bluffing.\nKATE: Tony, you didn't see the inside of his camper.\nTONY: That bad, huh?\nKATE: Picture the most disgusting public restroom you've ever been in, covered in puss and vomit. I would still rather live there than this guy's place.\nTONY: That's nice, Kate.\nKATE: You should thank me. Eating that crap will kill you.\nTONY: I'm more concerned about what Gibbs will do if this redneck takes one in our interrogation room.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT.

Why'd you murder Sergeant William Moore?\nRUNION: What? Who the hell is that?\nGIBBS: That's right. You probably don't recall his name.\nMOORE: (ON TAPE) Sir, I'm not here to fight you. We just want you to lower the music.(SFX: DOG BARKS B.G.)\n(STRUGGLE)\n(ON TAPE) Hey hey hey!\nRUNION: (ON TAPE) I'll kill you.\nMOORE: (ON TAPE) What you just did was assault--\nGIBBS: He was found yesterday lying at the bottom of a cliff.\nRUNION: Is that what this is all about? You think I killed some jarhead? No way, man. Nice try.\nGIBBS: Why'd you run?\nRUNION: 'Cause of the pot in my trailer. I got a medical condition.\nGIBBS: What? Stupidity?\nRUNION: Oh, man. I was really drunk that night. I barely even remember the guy. I sure as hell didn't kill him.\nGIBBS: Where were you yesterday between five thirty and seven thirty a.m.?\nRUNION: Sleeping. Yeah, at the rest stop off Two Eleven. I didn't even wake up until after ten o'clock.\nGIBBS: Witnesses.\nRUNION: Oh, sure. I mean, there were lots of other cars and trucks when I pulled in.\nGIBBS: I need names.\nRUNION: I don't have any names.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT.

INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nTONY: (V.O./FILTERED) Running it, boss.\nRUNION: So what happens now?\nGIBBS: You've got a violent past, your alibi's weak. And I've got you on tape threatening the victim. You tell me, Runion?\nDAVID: It's been this way my whole life. It's always been like this. One freakin' nightmare after another. But I swear to you, Agent Gibbs, I didn't kill anybody.\nGIBBS: We found your bat.\nDAVID: What bat?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. LAB - DAY\nMCGEE: Hey, Abby. You got something?\nABBY: Well, I've got good news and bad news. This is definitely our bat. The splinter from Sergeant Moore's head fits perfectly.\nMCGEE: Bad news?\nABBY: It's been wiped clean of any prints. The only thing on it is urushiol oil. That's the stuff found in ... aah!\nMCGEE: What?!\nABBY: You... you have to see this for yourself.\nMCGEE: Whoa! This is going to hurt, isn't it?\nABBY: Yes.\nMCGEE: I look like a circus freak!

Annoying me?\nTONY: No, the creepy way Gibbs used to sneak up on us.\nKATE: What do you mean used to?\nTONY: The old man's been wearing Ben-Gay lately. I can smell him coming a mile away.\nGIBBS: Is that a fact, DiNozzo?\nTONY: Knee feeling better, Boss?\nGIBBS: Much.\nTONY: Great.\nGIBBS: What about Runion's alibi?\nKATE: I've got the local sheriff pulling the security tapes from the rest stops on Route Two-Eleven.\nTONY: And we have a description of his pickup and trailer circulating with the state cops who worked the area that night.\nKATE: Do you think he did it, Gibbs?\nGIBBS: Oh, yeah. And Tony is cleaning up. (INTO PHONE) Janitorial, don't worry about interrogation. DiNozzo is gonna handle it. (TO TONY) You still here?\nTONY: Are you serious? ...You serious? Oh. In my defense, I did use the word creepy in the most... affectionate way. Right.\nKATE: You might want to use gloves.\nGIBBS: Where's McGee?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. NCIS AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY\nDUCKY: Oh, let's see what we're dealing with here, Timothy. Ah, the dreaded Toxicodendrom radicans... the Poison Ivy plant. You seem to be particularly allergic to it. Usually it takes several days for this sort of reaction to develop.\nMCGEE: I'm lucky that way.\nDUCKY: The last time I encountered a case of this magnitude, two young lovers fell asleep naked in a field of it. I don't think Sarah has ever forgiven me for that one.\nMCGEE: What I don't understand is how did I get it all over my face?\nDUCKY: It's the urushiol oil in the plant. Yes, once it gets on your hands it spreads by contact.\nMCGEE: Um... then I have a major problem, Ducky. When I was out there, I um... I had to... you know...?\nDUCKY: No, I don't.\nMCGEE: Relieve myself.\nDUCKY: Oh. Ooh. Well, let's take a look then.\nMCGEE: This is kind of embarrassing.\nDUCKY: I'm a doctor, McGee. I have seen everything there is to see more times than I care to remember. Good Lord!\nMCGEE: What? Is it bad?\nDUCKY: No, no it's fine. Fine. Nothing to worry about. I didn't expect to see quite so much ...swelling.\nMCGEE: If Tony finds out about this I'm going to have to quit.\nDUCKY: Well your secret is safe with me.(SFX: DOORS SLIDE OPEN)\nJIMMY: Doctor, I've got the new inspection forms you req - I'll come back.(SFX: DOORS SLIDE CLOSED)\nDUCKY: Him I'm not so sure about.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT.

I can almost smell him from here.\nGIBBS: How long did he stay?\nKATE: All night.\nGIBBS: Distance from Shenandoah River State Park?\nTONY: It's about two miles, Boss.\nKATE: Well, I guess he was telling the truth. We're going to have to find a new suspect.\n(PHONE RINGS)\nGIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, Gibbs. (TO KATE AND TONY) Maybe not. Come on.\nMUSICAL BRIDGE TO:\nINT. LAB - DAY\nABBY: How you feeling?\nMCGEE: Like an idiot. Tony tried to warn me. I didn't listen.\nABBY: Oh, don't feel bad. The same thing happened to him the first year he was here.\nMCGEE: Really?\nABBY: Not quite this spectacularly, but yeah.\nMCGEE: So honestly, how do I look?\nABBY: Um... do you want the truth, or do you want me to lie to you to ease the burden of your own self-loathing.\nMCGEE: I'd prefer the lie.\nABBY: Me, too. You're the fairest in the land, McGee.\nGIBBS: Okay, what have you got for me, Abs?\nMCGEE: It looks worse than it is.\nKATE: I'm not so sure about that.\nTONY: She means you look like the elephant man, Probie.\nKATE: Tony.\nTONY: It's true.\nGIBBS: Can you still work, McGee?\nMCGEE: Yeah sure, Boss.\nGIBBS: Okay, what have you got for me, Abby?\nABBY: Um, I cleaned up more of the Sergeant's videotape.\nGIBBS: I need to see the last thing he shot.\nABBY: Ooh, unfortunately that's the part that received the most damage from the impact. It was in contact from the heads and a lot of the data got...\nGIBBS: When?\nABBY: I sent it to the Naval photo lab and hopefully I'm going to have it back by tomorrow.\nGIBBS: Well what am I doing here, Abby?\nABBY: Because of this. This is from the beginning of the tape. It's mostly them setting up camp and checking out the area. And then there is... this.\nTONY: (V.O.) It looks like the widow and the best friend don't know they're being videotaped. (DIALOGUE OVER CAMCORDER SCENES)\nABBY: (V.O.) And on the next side...\nMOORE: (ON TAPE) Honey, what's wrong?\nTONY: Still think men and women can just be friends, Kate?\n(MUSIC OUT)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. LAB - DAY\nABBY: I can't be sure, Gibbs. According to Gloria, lip reading was never my strong suit.\nKATE: Gloria her deaf sister?\nGIBBS: Mm-mm. Mother.\nABBY: I think Judy Moore is saying... we have to something... blank him.\nKATE: Kill?\nABBY: No...\nGIBBS: Murder?\nABBY: Nope.\nTONY: Love.\nABBY: No.\nTONY: I really wish you'd stop doing that.\nGIBBS: I will, Tony, once you stop blanking up.\nKATE: Abby, could you pull the video back wider? You see how she's touching his face? I mean, it's very intimate. Clearly there's more than a friendship going on here.\nTONY: Which just goes to prove my point about the sexes, Kate.\nGIBBS: DiNozzo, you pick up Sergeant Caine in the morning. Kate, you pick up Judy Moore, don't tell her why.\nTONY: Looks like we're going to play Gibb's favorite game.\nABBY: Musical interrogation rooms.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. ARMY BASE - DAY\nMCGEE: People are staring at me.\nTONY: Of course. You're hideously disfigured, Probie. If you'd listened to me you wouldn't be in this mess.\nMCGEE: If I'd listened to you, Gibbs would have fired me six months ago. You were going to whack me, but you stopped. Why?\nTONY: Ah, I remember what was like being the new guy, trying to fit in, never make mistakes. Of course, the obvious.\nMCGEE: You like me?\nTONY: No, it would be like touching a leper.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. BUILDINGS - DAY\nCAINE: Ladies and gentlemen, this way please.

How?\nTONY: Baseball bat to the head.\nMCGEE: Fifty-foot fall from a cliff.\nTONY: Coyotes probably didn't help.\nCAINE: That redneck must have overheard Bill saying he was going to film up there in the morning. We've got to find him!\nTONY: We did.\nCAINE: You need me to I.D. him?\nTONY: No. We do want to know what happened when Sergeant Moore found out you were sleeping with his wife.\nCAINE: She told you that?\nTONY: No, he did. Didn't know he was videotaping you, did you?\nCAINE: It's not what you think.\nTONY: Oh, so you weren't sleeping with her?\nMCGEE: You're under arrest, Sergeant.\nCAINE: For what?\nTONY: We'll start with adultery and work our way up from there.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY\nJUDY: I don't mean to be rude, but couldn't you have just sent me my husband's personal effects, Agent Todd?\nKATE: Well, normally we would have but that camera you bought him is pretty expensive.\nJUDY: It still works?\nGIBBS: Yeah. In a way. Water?\nJUDY: Thank you.\nKATE: So Mrs. Moore, tell us about your husband? What kind of a man was he?\n(SFX: DOORS SLIDE OPEN)\nJUDY: Loving, gentle.\nGIBBS: What about jealous?\nTONY: Where do you want him, Boss?\nGIBBS: Interrogation one.\nJUDY: Roger?\nCAINE: Judy, what the hell did you tell them?\nTONY: No talking, Marine!\nJUDY: What is going on here?\nGIBBS: That's what you're going to tell me, Mrs. Moore.

This is where it gets interesting.\n(TAPE PLAYS)\n(SFX: MOORE GROANS/FALLS)\nGIBBS: He slipped and fell?\nABBY: In the original version. But this movie comes with an alternate ending. In slo-mo, right when the camera slams to the ground...\n(TAPE PLAYS)\nGIBBS: The killer recorded over it.\nABBY: The impact caused the heads to lose contact with the tape, preserving two frames from the original recording. I've been working on cleaning them up.\nGIBBS: Any way to recover the rest?\nABBY: Well, since all recordings leave a magnetic impression much like a computer hard drive, by the way, if I scan the data then I'll be able to separate out...\nGIBBS: When?\nABBY: You don't have to take the fun out of everything, Gibbs.

How long were you and Sergeant Moore friends?\nCAINE: Since boot camp, Sir.\nGIBBS: Perris Island or San Diego.\nCAINE: San Diego, Sir.\nGIBBS: Right. A Hollywood Marine.

INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nCAINE: No way, Sir.\nGIBBS: (V.O.) Why would she lie? (ON CAMERA) I mean, besides protecting you, Sergeant.\nCAINE: She's insane.

She was making breakfast.\nGIBBS: So what you're saying is she had about an hour to kill him?\nCAINE: I... I didn't say that.\nGIBBS: My mistake.
