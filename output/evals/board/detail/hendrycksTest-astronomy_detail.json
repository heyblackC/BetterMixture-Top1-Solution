How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy are the inner planets made of denser materials than the outer planets?\nA. In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.\nB. In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.\nC. Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.\nD. When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.\nAnswer: D",

The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD.

The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nHow does the greenhouse effect work?\nA. Ozone transmits visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorbs most of the infrared heat trapping the heat near the surface.\nB. Greenhouse gases transmit visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorb infrared light from Earth trapping the heat near the surface.\nC. Greenhouse gases absorb infrared light from the Sun which then heats the atmosphere and the surface.\nD. Greenhouse gases absorb X-rays and ultraviolet light from the Sun which then heat the atmosphere and the surface.\nAnswer: D",

The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC.

There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB.

There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nThe second cosmic velocity (or escape velocity) is the speed required by an object to escape the gravitational field of a celestial body with mass M and radius R.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nWhy isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nWhy is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nHow did Eratosthenes estimate the size of the Earth in 240 B.C.?\nA. By measuring the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.\nB. By measuring the size of Earth's shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse.\nC.
