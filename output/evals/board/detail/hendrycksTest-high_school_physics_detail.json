This rubber band can wind and unwind around the axle supporting the wheels. This toy is given a shove, after which the toy rolls across a flat surface and up a ramp. It is observed that the toy does not go a consistent distance up the ramp—in some trials it ends up higher than in other trials, even though the shove imparts the same kinetic energy to the cart each time. Which of the following is a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon?\nA. Depending on how the rubber band is initially wound, more or less potential energy can be transferred from the rubber band to the kinetic energy of the car’s motion.\nB.

Is this enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2?\nA. Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.\nB. No, because we don’t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.\nC. No, because we don’t know the mass of the cart.\nD. Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving to the east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.\nAnswer: D",

Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\nB. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\nC. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\nD. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\nAnswer: C",
