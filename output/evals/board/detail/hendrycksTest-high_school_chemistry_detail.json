How would the first ionization energy value for a neutral atom of potassum compare to those values?\nA. It would be greater than both because potassium carries a greater nuclear charge then either chlorine or argon.\nB. It would be greater than both because the size of a potassium atom is smaller than an atom of either chlorine or argon.\nC. It would be less than both because there are more electrons in potassium, meaning they repel each other more effectively and less energy is needed to remove one.\nD. It would be less than both because a valence electron of potassium is farther from the nucleus than one of either chlorine or argon.\nAnswer: D",

All other hydrogen halides (represented by HX, where X is any other halogen) are gases at the same temperature. Why?\nA. Fluorine has a very high electronegativity; therefore the H-F bond is stronger than any other H-X bond.\nB. HF is smaller than any other H-X molecule; therefore it exhibits stronger London dispersion forces.\nC. The dipoles in a HF molecule exhibit a particularly strong attraction force to the dipoles in other HF molecules.\nD. The H-F bond is the most ionic in character compared to all other hydrogen halides.\nAnswer: D",
