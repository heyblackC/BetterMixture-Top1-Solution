Let Boolean random variable D mean a patient “has disease D” and let Boolean random variable TP stand for \"tests positive.\" Tests for disease D are known to be very accurate in the sense that the probability of testing positive when you have the disease is 0.99, and the probability of testing negative when you do not have the disease is 0.97. What is P(TP), the prior probability of testing positive.\nA. 0.0368\nB. 0.473\nC. 0.078\nD. None of the above\nAnswer: D",

Inputs are $100$-dimensional, and have several features such as the number of square feet, the median family income, etc. The first hidden layer has $1000$ activations. The second hidden layer has $10$ activations. The output is a scalar representing the house price. Assuming a vanilla network with affine transformations and with no batch normalization and no learnable parameters in the activation function, how many parameters does this network have?\nA. 111021\nB. 110010\nC. 111110\nD. 110011\nAnswer: D",

The functional form of f’s decision boundary is the same as h’s, but with different parameters. (e.g., if h was a linear classifier, then f is also a linear classifier).
